#  LOCALIZATION NOTE: FILE
#  Do not translate anything in this file

# This is a list of encodings used for special *symbolic fonts* (not documents) for
# which we have converters (i.e., the intl/uconv library contains encoding tables
# that provide a mapping of characters to the indices of the desired glyphshapes
# within these symbolic fonts).
#
# For each 'key = value' pair in this list:
#
# - the 'key' is a lower case ASCII with the *name of the font*, and the
#   encoding type (e.g., .ttf for TrueType, and .t1 for Type 1). Note that
#   the *name of a font* is not necessarily the *name of the file* that contains
#   the font... All whitespace should be stripped from the name.
#
# - the 'value' is the case-sensitive charset string used when setting up the
#   corresponding Unicode Converter in the intl/uconv library.
