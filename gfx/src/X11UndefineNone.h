// The header <X11/X.h> defines "None" as a macro that expands to "0L".
// This is terrible because many enumerations have an enumerator named "None".
// To work around this, we undefine the macro "None", and define a replacement
// macro named "X11None".
// Include this header after including X11 headers, where necessary.
#ifdef None
#  undef None
#  define X11None 0L
// <X11/X.h> also defines "RevertToNone" as a macro that expands to "(int)None".
// Since we are undefining "None", that stops working. To keep it working,
// we undefine "RevertToNone" and redefine it in terms of "X11None".
#  ifdef RevertToNone
#    undef RevertToNone
#    define RevertToNone (int)X11None

// X11 also defines Always, which conflicts with some style system enum variant
// names, so get rid of that too, given we don't use it anywhere else.
#ifdef Always

// And Complex...
#ifdef Complex
#  undef Complex
#endif

#ifdef CurrentTime

// X11/Xlib.h also defines True and False, get rid of those too for
