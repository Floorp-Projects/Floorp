 *
 * The SyncAndGetError() method allows to know whether a X error occurred,
 * optionally allows to get the full XErrorEvent, and resets the recorded X
 * error state so that a single X error will be reported only once.
 *
 * Nesting is correctly handled: multiple nested ScopedXErrorHandler's don't
 * interfere with each other's state. However, if SyncAndGetError is not called
 * on the nested ScopedXErrorHandler, then any X errors caused by X calls made
 * while the nested ScopedXErrorHandler was in place may then be caught by the
 * other ScopedXErrorHandler. This is just a result of X being asynchronous and
 * us not doing any implicit syncing: the only method in this class what causes
 * syncing is SyncAndGetError().
 *
 * This class is not thread-safe at all. It is assumed that only one thread is
 * using any ScopedXErrorHandler's. Given that it's not used on Mac, it should
 * be easy to make it thread-safe by using thread-local storage with __thread.
