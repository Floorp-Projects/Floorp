#  LOCALIZATION NOTE: FILE
#  Do not translate anything in this file

# This is a list of encodings used for special *symbolic fonts* (not documents) # for  which we have converters (i.e., the intl/uconv library contains encoding # tables that provide a mapping of characters to the indices of the desired 
# glyph shapes  within these symbolic fonts).
#
# This file also lists truetype cmap tables for single byte ('narrow') special
# *symbolic fonts*. At the moment, only two values, 'mac_roman' 
# and 'unicode' are recognized. These cmaps are used to translate custom font 
# codes obtained through converters in intl/uconv library into glyph indices of # fonts  with Freetype library. Do not change the value unless you're familiar
# with the internals of Freetype and Mozilla-Xft. If you're interested,
# see  
#   http://freetype.sourceforge.net/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-base_interface.html#FT_Encoding
# and  
#   http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=176290
#
# For each 'key = value' pair in this list:
#
# - the 'key' is a lower case ASCII with the *name of the font*, and the
#   encoding type (e.g., .ttf for TrueType, and .t1 for Type 1). Note that
#   the *name of a font* is not necessarily the *name of the file* that contains
#   the font... All whitespace should be stripped from the name.
#   For truetype cmaps, use .ftcmap in place of .ttf or .t1.
#
# - the 'value' is the case-sensitive charset string used when setting up the
#   corresponding Unicode Converter in the intl/uconv library.
# - the 'value' for ftcmap is either mac_roman 
#   or unicode.

# If you have Symbol (Adobe) type 1 font, keep the following lines 
# commented out (you do NOT need them). However,  with  truetype Symbol 
# font,  you do need them.

#encoding.symbol.ttf = Adobe-Symbol-Encoding
