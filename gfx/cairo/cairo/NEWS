Snapshot 0.5.0 (2005-05-17 Carl Worth <cworth@cworth.org>)
==========================================================
This is a pretty big, and fairly significant snapshot.  It represents
between 2 and 3 months of solid work from a lot of people on improving
the API as much as possible. I'd like to express my appreciation and
congratulations to everyone who has worked on the big API Shakeup,
(whether in email battles over names, or fixing my silly bugs).

This snapshot will require some effort on the part of users, since
there are a _lot_ of API changes (ie. no cairo program ever written is
safe --- they're all broken now in at least one way). But, in spite of
that, we do encourage everyone to move their code to this snapshot as
soon as possible. And we're doing everything we can think of to make
the transition as smooth as possible.

The idea behind 0.5 is that we've tried to make every good API change
we could want now, and get them all done with. That is, between now
and the 1.0 release of cairo, we expect very few new API changes,
(though some will certainly sneak in). We will have some significant
additions, but the pain of moving code from cairo 0.4 to cairo 0.5
should be a one time experience, and things should be much smoother as
we continue to move toward cairo 1.0.

And with so many changes coming out for the first time in this 0.5
release, we really do need a lot of people trying this out to make
sure the ideas are solid before we freeze the API in preparation for
the 1.0 release.

OK, enough introduction. Here is a (not-quite-complete) description of
the API removals, changes and additions in this snapshot, (compared to
0.4.0)

API removals
============
The following public functions have been removed:

- cairo_set_target_*

	This is a big change. See the description of cairo_create in
	the API changes section for how to deal with this.

- cairo_set_alpha

	Alpha blending hasn't gone away; there's just a much more
	unified rendering model now. Almost all uses of
	cairo_set_alpha will be trivially replaced with
	cairo_set_source_rgba and a few others will be replaced just
	as easily with cairo_paint_with_alpha.

- cairo_show_surface

	Another useful function that we realized was muddling up the
	rendering model. The replacement is quite easy:
	cairo_set_source_surface and cairo_paint.

- cairo_matrix_create
- cairo_matrix_destroy
- cairo_matrix_copy
- cairo_matrix_get_affine

	These functions supported an opaque cairo_matrix_t. We now
	have an exposed cairo_matrix_t structure, so these can be
	dropped.

- cairo_surface_set_repeat
- cairo_surface_set_matrix
- cairo_surface_set_filter

	These properties don't belong on surfaces. If you were using
	them, you'll just want to instead use
	cairo_pattern_create_for_surface and then set these properties
	on the pattern.

- cairo_copy

	This was a confusing function and hopefully nobody will miss
	it. But if you really don't find cairo_save/restore adequate,
	let us know and we have another idea for a potential
	replacement.

And while we're on the subject of removals, we carefully tightened up
the cairo header files so they no longer gratuitously include header
files that are not strictly necessary, (stdio.h, stdint.h, pixman.h,
Xrender.h, etc. and their dependencies). This may lead to some
surprising errors, so keep your eyes open for that.

API changes
===========
Here are some of the API changes that have occurred:

~ cairo_create(void) -> cairo_create(cairo_surface_t *)

	This is the big change that breaks every program. The ability
	to re-target a cairo_t was not particularly useful, but it did
	introduce a lot of muddy semantic questions. To eliminate
	that, cairo_create now requires its target surface to be
	passed in at creation time. This isn't too hard to cope with
	as the typical first operation after cairo_create was often
	cairo_set_target_foo. So the order of those two swap and the
	application instead has cairo_foo_surface_create, then
	cairo_create.

~ cairo_current_* -> cairo_get_*

	We had a strange mixture of cairo_get and cairo_current
	functions. They've all been standardized on cairo_get, (though
	note one is cairo_get_current_point).

~ CAIRO_OPERATOR_SRC -> CAIRO_OPERATOR_SOURCE
~ CAIRO_OPERATOR_OVER_REVERSE -> CAIRO_OPERATOR_DEST_OVER

	Many of the cairo_operator_t symbolic values were renamed to
	reduce the amount of abbreviation. The confusing "OP_REVERSE"
	naming was also changed to use "DEST_OP" instead which is
	easier to read and has wider acceptance in other
	libraries/languages.

~ cairo_set_pattern -> cairo_set_source
~ cairo_set_rgb_color -> cairo_set_source_rgb

	All of the various functions that changed the source
	color/pattern were unified to use cairo_set_source names to
	make the relation more clear.

~ cairo_transform_point		   -> cairo_user_to_device
~ cairo_transform_distance	   -> cairo_user_to_device_distance
~ cairo_inverse_transform_point	   -> cairo_device_to_user
~ cairo_inverse_transform_distance -> cairo_device_to_user_distance

	These names just seemed a lot more clear.

~ cairo_init_clip	-> cairo_reset_clip
~ cairo_concat_matrix	-> cairo_transform

	More abbreviation elimination

~ cairo_current_path	  -> cairo_copy_path
~ cairo_current_path_flat -> cairo_copy_path_flat

	The former mechanism for examining the current path was a
	function that required 3 or 4 callbacks. This was more
	complexity than warranted in most situations. The new
	cairo_copy_path function copies the current path into an
	exposed data structure, and the documentation provides a
	convenient idiom for navigating the path data.

API additions
-------------
+ cairo_paint

	A generalized version of the painting operators cairo_stroke
	and cairo_fill. The cairo_paint call applies the source paint
	everywhere within the current clip region. Very useful for
	clearing a surface to a solid color, or painting an image,
	(see cairo_set_source_surface).

+ cairo_paint_with_alpha

	Like cairo_paint but applying some alpha to the source,
	(making the source paint translucent, eg. to blend an image on
	top of another).

+ cairo_mask

	A more generalized version of cairo_paint_with_alpha which
	allows a pattern to specify the amount of translucence at each
	point rather than using a constant value everywhere.

+ cairo_mask_surface

	A convenience function on cairo_mask for when the mask pattern
	is already contained within a surface.

+ cairo_surface_set_user_data
+ cairo_surface_get_user_data
+ cairo_font_face_set_user_data
+ cairo_font_face_get_user_data

	Associate arbitrary data with a surface or font face for later
	retrieval. Get notified when a surface or font face object is
	destroyed.

+ cairo_surface_finish

	Allows the user to instruct cairo to finish all of its
	operations for a given surface. This provides a safe point for
	doing things such as flushing and closing files that the
	surface may have had open for writing.

+ cairo_fill_preserve
+ cairo_stroke_preserve
+ cairo_clip_preserve

	One interesting change in cairo is that the path is no longer
	part of the graphics state managed by
	cairo_save/restore. This allows functions to construct paths
	without interfering with the graphics state. But it prevents
	the traditional idiom for fill-and-stroke:

		cairo_save; cairo_fill; cairo_restore; cairo_stroke

	Instead we know have alternate versions cairo cairo_fill,
	cairo_stroke, and cairo_clip that preserve the current path
	rather than consuming it. So the idiom now becomes simply:

		cairo_fill_preserve; cairo_stroke

+ cairo_surface_write_to_png
+ cairo_surface_write_to_png_stream

	In place of a single PNG backend, now a surface created
	through any backend (except PDF currently) can be written out
	to a PNG image.

+ cairo_image_surface_create_from_png
+ cairo_image_surface_create_from_png_stream

	And its just as easy to load a PNG image into a surface as well.

+ cairo_append_path

	With the new, exposed path data structure, it's now possible
	to append bulk path data to the current path, (rather than
	issuing a long sequence of cairo_move_to/line_to/curve_to
	function calls).

Xlib and XCB backends
---------------------

Any cairo_format_t and Colormap arguments have been dropped from
cairo_xlib_surface_create. There are also two new
cairo_xlib|xcb_surface_create functions:

	cairo_xlib|xcb_surface_create_for_bitmap
		(Particular for creating A1 surfaces)
	cairo_xlib|xcb_surface_create_with_xrender_format
		(For any other surface types, not described by a Visual*)

All of these surface create functions now accept width and height. In
addition, there are new cairo_xlib|xcb_surface_set_size functions
which must be called each time a window that is underlying a surface
changes size.

Print backends (PS and PDF)
---------------------------
The old FILE* based interfaces have been eliminated. In their place we
have two different functions. One accepts a simple const char
*filename. The other is a more general function which accepts a
callback write function and a void* closure. This should allow the
flexibility needed to hook up with various stream object in many
languages.

In addition, when specifying the surface size during construction, the
units are now device-space units (ie. points) rather than inches. This
provides consistency with all the other surface types and also makes
it much easier to reason about the size of the surface when drawing to
it with the default identity matrix.

Finally, the DPI parameters, which are only needed to control the
quality of fallbacks, have been made optional. Nothing is required
during surface_create (300 DPI is assumed) and
cairo_ps|pdf_surface_set_dpi can be used to set alternate values if
needed.

Font system
-----------
Owen very graciously listened to feedback after the big font rework he
had done for 0.4, and came up with way to improve it even more. In 0.4
there was a cairo_font_t that was always pre-scaled. Now, there is an
unscaled cairo_font_face_t which is easier to construct, (eg. no
scaling matrix required) and work with, (it can be scaled and
transformed after being set on the graphics state). And the font size
manipulation functions are much easier. You can set an explicit size
and read/modify/write the font matrix with:

	cairo_set_font_size
	cairo_get_font_matrix
	cairo_set_font_matrix

(Previously you could only multiply in a scale factor or a matrix.) A
pleasant side effect is that we can (and do) now have a default font
size that is reasonable, as opposed to the old default height of one
device-space unit which was useless until scaled.

Of course, the old pre-scaled font had allowed some performance
benefits when getting many metrics for a font. Those benefits are
still made available through the new cairo_scaled_font_t. And a
cairo_font_face_t can be "promoted" to a cairo_scaled_font_t by
suppling a font_matrix and the desired CTM.

Quartz backend
--------------
Tim Rowley put in the work to bring the Quartz backend back after it
had been disabled in the 0.4.0 snapshot. He was not able to bring back
the function that allows one to create a cairo_font_t from an ATSUI
style:

	cairo_font_t *
	cairo_atsui_font_create (ATSUStyle style);

because he didn't have a test case for it. If you care about this
function, please provide a fairly minimal test and we'll try to bring
it back in an upcoming snapshot.

Snapshot 0.4.0 (2005-03-08 Carl Worth <cworth@cworth.org>)
==========================================================
New documentation
-----------------
Owen Taylor has converted cairo's documentation system to gtk-doc and
has begun some long-needed work on the documentation, which can now be
viewed online here:

	http://cairographics.org/manual/

New backend: win32
------------------
This is the first snapshot to include a functional win32 backend,
(thanks to Owen Taylor). The interface is as follows:

	#include <cairo-win32.h>

	void 
	cairo_set_target_win32 (cairo_t *cr,
				HDC      hdc);

	cairo_surface_t *
	cairo_win32_surface_create (HDC hdc);

	cairo_font_t *
	cairo_win32_font_create_for_logfontw (LOGFONTW       *logfont,
					      cairo_matrix_t *scale);

	cairo_status_t
	cairo_win32_font_select_font (cairo_font_t *font,
				      HDC           hdc);

	void
	cairo_win32_font_done_font (cairo_font_t *font);

	double
	cairo_win32_font_get_scale_factor (cairo_font_t *font);

And see also the documentation at:

http://cairographics.org/manual/cairo-Microsoft-Windows-Backend.html

Disabled backend: quartz
------------------------
Unfortunately, the quartz backend code is currently out of date with
respect to some recent backend interface changes. So, the quartz
backend is disabled in this snapshot.

If the quartz backend is brought up-to-date before the next snapshot,
we would be glad to make a 0.4.1 snapshot that re-enables it, (we do
not expect many more big backend interface changes).

API Changes
-----------
The font system has been revamped, (as Owen Taylor's work with
integrating pango and cairo gave us the first serious usage of the
non-toy font API).

One fundamental, user-visible change is that the cairo_font_t object
now represents a font that is scaled to a particular device
resolution. Further changes are described below.

 cairo.h
 -------
 Removed cairo_font_set_transform and cairo_font_current_transform.

 Added cairo_font_extents and cairo_font_glyph_extents. See
 documentation for details:

 http://cairographics.org/manual/cairo-cairo-t.html#cairo-font-extents

 cairo-ft.h
 ----------
 The cairo_ft_font API changed considerably. Please see the
 documentation for details:

 http://cairographics.org/manual/cairo-FreeType-Fonts.html

Performance
-----------
Make the fast-path clipping (pixel-aligned rectangles) faster.

Add optimization for applying a constant alpha to a pattern.

Optimize gradients that are horizontal or vertical in device space.

Xlib: When RENDER is not available, use image surfaces for
intermediate surfaces rather than xlib surfaces.

Backend-specific changes
------------------------
 Glitz
 -----
 Major update to glitz backend. The output quality should now be just
 as good as the image and xlib backends.

 Track changes to glitz 0.4.0.

 PDF
 ---
 Various improvements to produce more conformant output.

Internals
---------
David Reveman contributed a large re-work of the cairo_pattern_t
implementation, providing cleaner code and more optimization
opportunities.

 Backend interface changes
 -------------------------
 Rework backend interface to accept patterns, not surfaces for source
 and mask.

 Remove set_matrix, set_filter, and set_repeat functions.

 More sophisticated backend interface for image fallbacks,
 ({acquire,release}_{source,dest}_image() and clone_similar).

Bug fixes
---------
Only install header files for backends that have been compiled.

Fixed some rounding errors leading to incorrectly placed glyphs.

Many other minor fixes.

Snapshot 0.3.0 (2005-01-21 Carl Worth <cworth@cworth.org>)
==========================================================
Major API changes
-----------------
1) The public header files will no longer be directly installed into
   the system include directory. They will now be installed in a
   subdirectory named "cairo", (eg. in /usr/include/cairo rather than
   in /usr/include).

   As always, the easiest way for applications to discover the
   location of the header file is to let pkg-config generate the
   necessary -I CFLAGS and -L/-l LDFLAGS. For example:

	cc `pkg-config --cflags --libs cairo` -o foo foo.c

   IMPORTANT: Users with old versions of cairo installed will need to
              manually remove cairo.h and cairo-features.h from the
              system include directories in order to prevent the old
              headers from being used in preference to the new ones.

2) The backend-specific portions of the old monolithic cairo.h have
   been split out into individual public header files. The new files
   are:

	cairo-atsui.h
        cairo-ft.h
        cairo-glitz.h
        cairo-pdf.h
        cairo-png.h
        cairo-ps.h
	cairo-quartz.h
        cairo-xcb.h
        cairo-xlib.h

   Applications will need to be modified to explicitly include the new
   header files where appropriate.

3) There are two new graphics backends in this snapshot, a PDF
   backend, and a Quartz backend. There is also one new font backend,
   ATSUI.

PDF backend
-----------
Kristian Høgsberg has contributed a new backend to allow cairo-based
applications to generate PDF output. The interface for creating a PDF
surface is similar to that of the PS backend, as can be seen in
cairo-pdf.h:

	void
	cairo_set_target_pdf (cairo_t	*cr,
			      FILE	*file,
			      double	width_inches,
			      double	height_inches,
			      double	x_pixels_per_inch,
			      double	y_pixels_per_inch);

	cairo_surface_t *
	cairo_pdf_surface_create (FILE		*file,
				  double	width_inches,
				  double	height_inches,
				  double	x_pixels_per_inch,
				  double	y_pixels_per_inch);

Once a PDF surface has been created, applications can draw to it as
any other cairo surface.

This code is still a bit rough around the edges, and does not yet
support clipping, surface patterns, or transparent gradients.  Text
only works with TrueType fonts at this point and only black text is
supported.  Also, the size of the generated PDF files is currently
quite big.

Kristian is still actively developing this backend, so watch this
space for future progress.

Quartz backend
--------------
Calum Robinson has contributed a new backend to allow cairo
applications to target native Mac OS X windows through the Quartz
API. Geoff Norton integrated this backend into the current
configure-based build system, while Calum also provided Xcode build
support in the separate "macosx" module available in CVS.

The new interface, available in cairo-quartz.h, is as follows:

	void
	cairo_set_target_quartz_context (cairo_t	*cr,
					 CGContextRef	context,
					 int		width,
					 int		height);

	cairo_surface_t *
	cairo_quartz_surface_create (CGContextRef context,
				     int	  width,
				     int	  height);

There is an example program available in CVS in cairo-demo/quartz. It
is a port of Keith Packard's fdclock program originally written for
the xlib backend. A screenshot of this program running on Mac OS X is
available here:

	http://cairographics.org/~cworth/images/fdclock-quartz.png

ATSUI font backend
------------------
This new font backend complements the Quartz backend by allowing
applications to use native font selection on Mac OS X. The interface
is a single new function:

	cairo_font_t *
	cairo_atsui_font_create (ATSUStyle style);

Minor API changes
-----------------
Prototype for non-existent function "cairo_ft_font_destroy" removed.

Now depends on libpixman 0.1.2 or newer, (0.1.3 is being released
concurrently and has some useful performance improvements).

Default paint color is now opaque black, (was opaque white). Default
background color is transparent (as before).

Renamed "struct cairo" to "struct _cairo" to free up the word "cairo"
from the C++ identifier name space.

Functions returning multiple return values through provided pointers,
(cairo_matrix_get_affine, cairo_current_point, and
cairo_current_color_rgb), will now accept NULL for values the user
wants to ignore.

CAIRO_HAS_FREETYPE_FONT has now been renamed to CAIRO_HAS_FT_FONT.

Performance improvements
------------------------
Alexander Larsson provided some fantastic performance improvements
yielding a 10000% performance improvement in his application, (when
also including his performance work in libpixman-0.1.3). These include

 * Fixed handling of cache misses.

 * Creating intermediate clip surfaces at the minimal size required.

 * Eliminating roundtrips when creating intermediate Xlib surfaces.

Implementation
--------------
Major re-work of font metrics system by Keith Packard. Font metrics
should now be much more reliable.

Glitz backend
-------------
Updated for glitz-0.3.0.
Bug fixes in reference counting.

Test suite
----------
New tests for cache crashing, rotating text, improper filling of
complex polygons, and leaky rasterization.

Bug fixes
---------
Fixed assertion failure when selecting the same font multiple times in
sequence.

Fixed reference counting so cache_destroy functions work.

Remove unintended copyright statement from files generated with
PostScript backend.

Fixed to eliminate new warnings from gcc 3.4 and gcc 4.

Snapshot 0.2.0 (2004-10-27 Carl Worth <cworth@cworth.org>)
===========================================================
New license: LGPL/MPL
---------------------
The most significant news with this release is that the license of
cairo has changed. It is now dual-licensed under the LGPL and the
MPL. For details see the COPYING file as well as COPYING-LGPL-2.1 and
COPYING-MPL-1.1.

I express my thanks to everyone involved in the license change process
for their patience and support!

New font and glyph internals
----------------------------
Graydon Hoare has put a tremendous amount of work into new internals
for handling fonts and glyphs, including caches where appropriate.
This work has no impact on the user-level API, but should result in
great performance improvements for applications using text.

New test suite
--------------
This snapshot of cairo includes a (small) test suite in
cairo/test. The tests can be run with "make check". The test suite was
designed to make it very easy to add new tests, and we hope to see
many contributions here. As you find bugs, please try adding a minimal
test case to the suite, and submit it with the bug report to the
cairo@cairographics.org mailing list. This will make it much easier
for us to track progress in fixing bugs.

New name for glitz backend
--------------------------
The gl backend has now been renamed to the glitz backend. This means
that the following names have changed:

	CAIRO_HAS_GL_SURFACE    -> CAIRO_HAS_GLITZ_SURFACE
	cairo_set_target_gl     -> cairo_set_target_glitz
	cairo_gl_surface_create -> cairo_glitz_surface_create

This change obviously breaks backwards compatibility for applications
using the old gl backend.

Up-to-date with latest glitz snapshots
--------------------------------------
This snapshot of cairo is now up to date with the latest glitz
snapshot, (currently 0.2.3). We know that the latest cairo and glitz
snapshots have been incompatible for a very long time. We've finally
fixed that now and we're determined to not let that happen again.

Revert some tessellation regression bugs
----------------------------------------
People that have been seeing some tessellation bugs, (eg. leaked
fills), in the CVS version of cairo may have better luck with this
release. A change since the last snapshot was identified to trigger
some of these bugs and was reverted before making the snapshot. The
behavior should be the same as the previous (0.1.23) snapshot.

Miscellaneous changes
---------------------
Changed CAIRO_FILTER_DEFAULT to CAIRO_FILTER_BEST to make gradients
easier.

Track XCB API change regarding iterators.

Various bug fixes
-----------------
Fix calculation of required number of vertices for pen.

Fix to avoid zero-dimensioned pixmaps.

Fix broken sort of pen vertices.

Fix bug when cairo_show_text called with a NULL string.

Fix clipping bugs.

Fix bug in computing image length with XCB.

Fix infinite loop bug in cairo_arc.

Fix memory management interactions with libpixman.

Snapshot 0.1.23 (2004-05-11 Carl Worth <cworth@isi.edu>)
========================================================
Fixes for gcc 3.4
-----------------
Fix prototype mismatches so that cairo can be built by gcc 3.4.

Updates to track glitz
----------------------
Various fixes to support the latest glitz snapshot (0.1.2).

Gradient updates
----------------
Radial gradients now support both inner and outer circles.
Transformed linear gradients are now properly handled.
Fixes for extend type reflect.

Glitz updates
-------------
Converted shading routines to use fixed point values and introduced a
shading operator structure for more efficient shading calculations.
Support compositing with mask surface when mask is solid or
multi-texturing is available.

PNG backend cleanups
--------------------
Fix output to properly compensate for pre-multiplied alpha format in cairo.
Add support for A8 and A1 image formats.

Bug fixes
---------
Avoid crash or infinite loop on null strings and degeneratively short
splines.

New? bugs in cairo_clip
-----------------------
There are some fairly serious bugs in cairo_clip. It is sometimes
causing an incorrect result. And even when it does work, it is
sometimes so slow as to be unusable. Some of these bugs may not be
new, (indeed cairo_clip has only ever had a braindead-slow
implementation), but I think they're worth mentioning here.

Snapshot 0.1.22 (2004-04-16 Carl Worth <cworth@isi.edu>)
========================================================
Cairo was updated to track the changes in libpixman, and now depends
on libpixman version 0.1.1.

Snapshot 0.1.21 (2004-04-09 David Reveman <c99drn@cs.umu.se>)
=============================================================
New OpenGL backend
------------------
The OpenGL backend provides hardware accelerated output for
X11 and OS X. The significant new functions are:

	cairo_set_target_gl
	cairo_gl_surface_create

Automatic detection of available backends
-----------------------------------------
The configure script now automatically detect what backends are
available, (use ./configure --disable-`backend' to prevent
compilation of specific backends).

Snapshot 0.1.20 (2004-04-06 Carl Worth <cworth@isi.edu>)
========================================================
New pattern API
---------------
David Reveman has contributed a new pattern API which enable linear
and radial gradient patterns in addition to the original surface-based
patterns. The significant new top-level functions are:

	cairo_pattern_create_linear
	cairo_pattern_create_radial
	cairo_pattern_create_for_surface
	cairo_pattern_add_color_stop
	cairo_set_pattern

Any code using the old cairo_set_pattern, (which accepted a
cairo_surface_t rather than a cairo_pattern_t), will need to be
updated.

Update to XCB backend
---------------------
The XCB backend is now enabled by default, (use ./configure
--disable-xcb to turn it off).

Faster clipping
---------------
Graydon Hoare has added optimizations that make cairo_clip much faster
when the path is a pixel-aligned, rectangular region.

Bug fixes.

Snapshot 0.1.19 (2004-02-24 Carl Worth <cworth@isi.edu>)
========================================================
New PNG backend
---------------
Olivier Andrieu contributed a new PNG backend. It builds on the
existing image backend to make it easy to render "directly" to a
.png file. The user never needs to deal with the actual image
buffer. The significant new functions are:

	cairo_set_target_png
	cairo_png_surface_create

The PNG backend is not enabled by default so that by default there is
not a new dependency on libpng. Use ./configure --enable-png to enable
this backend.

Snapshot 0.1.18 (2004-02-17 Carl Worth <cworth@isi.edu>)
========================================================
Path query functionality
------------------------
It's now possible to query the current path. The two new functions
are:

	cairo_current_path
	cairo_current_path_flat

Each function accepts a number of callback functions that will be
called for each element in the path (move_to, line_to, curve_to,
close_path). The cairo_current_path_flat function does not accept a
curve_to callback. Instead, all curved portions of the path will be
converted to line segments, (within the current tolerance value). This
can be handy for doing things like text-on-path without having to
manually interpolate bezier splines.

New XCB backend
---------------
Jamey Sharp has contributed a second X backend that uses the new, lean
XCB library rather than Xlib. It cannot currently be compiled at the
same time as the Xlib backend. See ./configure --enable-xcb.

Build fixes for cygwin.

Bug fixes.

Snapshot 0.1.17 (2003-12-16 Carl Worth <cworth@isi.edu>)
========================================================

Better text support
-------------------
This snapshot provides much better text support by implementing the
following four functions:

        cairo_text_extents
        cairo_glyph_extents
        cairo_text_path
        cairo_glyph_path

The text/glyph_extents functions can be used to determine the bounding
box (and advance) for text as if drawn by show_text/glyphs.

The text/glyph_path objects functions place text shapes on the current
path, where they can be subsequently manipulated. For example,
following these functions with cairo_stroke allows outline text to be
drawn. Calling cairo_clip allows clipping to a text-shaped region.

Combined dependencies
---------------------
The cairo core now depends only on the libpixman library. This single
library replaces the three previous libraries libic, libpixregion, and
slim. Thanks to Dave Beckett <dave.beckett@bristol.ac.uk> for all of
the heavy lifting with this renaming effort.

Conditional compilation of backends
-----------------------------------
Cairo now allows optional backends to be disabled at compile time. The
following options may now be passed to the configure script:

	--disable-xlib
	--disable-ps

Note that the first option is a change from the old --without-x option
which will no longer have any effect.

OS X supported - several byte-order issues resolved
---------------------------------------------------
Cairo has now been successfully compiled under OS X. Testing revealed
that there were some byte-order problems in the PostScript backend and
the PNG generation in the demos. These have now been resolved.

2003-10
=======
Graydon Hoare <graydon@redhat.com> implemented the first real text
support using Freetype/fontconfig, (previous versions of cairo used
Xft and could only draw text when using an X backend).

2003-09
=======
Graydon Hoare <graydon@redhat.com> added the first real support for
running cairo with a non-render-aware X server.

Jamey Sharp <jamey@minilop.net> virtualized the backend font and
surface interfaces in September, 2003.

2003-06
=======
Xr is renamed cairo to avoid confusion since it no longer had a strict
dependence on X.

2003-05
=======
A new image surface backend is added to Xr. Keith Packard
<keithp@keithp.com> wrote the image compositing code in libic that is
used for the image_surface backend. This code was originally written
as the software fallback for the render extension within the X
server.

2002-06
=======
Carl Worth <cworth@isi.edu> wrote the first lines of Xr, after Keith
Packard <keithp@keithp.com> proposed the plan for a stateful drawing
library in C providing a PostScript-like rendering model.
