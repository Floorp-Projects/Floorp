Snapshot 0.1.4 (2005-03-07 Carl Worth <cworth@cworth.org>)
==========================================================
API Addition
------------
Add new function:

	void
	pixman_add_trapezoids (pixman_image_t           *dst,
	                       int                      x_off,
	                       int                      y_off,
	                       const pixman_trapezoid_t *traps,
	                       int                      ntraps);

Performance improvement
-----------------------
Restrict size of intermediate surface used while compositing
trapezoids based on the bounds of the desination surface.

Bug fixes
---------
Fix rendering on 64-bit platforms.

Snapshot 0.1.3 (2005-01-21 Carl Worth <cworth@cworth.org>)
==========================================================
Performance improvements
------------------------
Solid fills are now much faster, (thanks to Alexander Larsson).

Bug fixes
---------
Fixed to quiet warnings in newer versions of gcc.

Don't divide-by-zero if given an image of size 0x0.

Fixed several corner cases where values outside a trapezoid would be
drawn with alpha 1/255 (in the 8-bit case).

Internal changes
----------------
Imported the newer point-sampling trapezoid rasterization code that
Keith Packard wrote for the X server. This provide pixel-perfect
matching with the Render extension as well as code that is simpler,
more robust, and easier to maintain.

Snapshot 0.1.2 (2004-10-27 Carl Worth <cworth@cworth.org>)
==========================================================
New functionality
-----------------
Added three new functions:

	pixman_image_set_component_alpha
	pixman_format_get_masks
	pixman_image_get_format

The first enables component-alpha compositing which can be used for
optimizing sub-pixel rendering of text and other geometry. This is
useful when the geometrical relationship of the sub-pixel components
of the display device are known, (eg. with flat-panel monitors rather
than CRTs).

The other two functions are simple query functions that were missing.

Bug fixes
---------
Enabling both transform and repeat simultaneously now works.
Some byte-order fixes.
Clipping fixes: pixman now takes a copy of the client clipping region
                client clipping is now actually used, it wasn't earlier.

Snapshot 0.1.1 (2004-04-16 Carl Worth <cworth@east.isi.edu>)
============================================================
Build fixes for cygwin
----------------------
This snapshot adds the -no-undefined flag during compilation which is
necessart for building a shared library under cygwin.

Cleanup of the public API
-------------------------
We recently noticed that there were a coupld of bugs in the script
that renamed libic to libpixman. Fixing this requires the following
changes in the public API:

	PIXMAN_FORMAT_AR_GB32 -> PIXMAN_FORMAT_ARGB32
	PIXMAN_FORMAT_RG_B24 -> PIXMAN_FORMAT_RGB24

While we're changing that, we also normalized the names of structure
tags, for example:

	struct _pixman_region16_t -> struct pixman_region16
	etc.

but users are expected to use typedefs such as pixman_region16_t
anyway.
