Snapshots of cairo and glitz for mozilla usage.

We only include the relevant parts of each release (generally, src/*.[ch]),
as we have Makefile.in's that integrate into the Mozilla build system.  For
documentation and similar, please see the official tarballs at
http://www.cairographics.org/.

VERSIONS:

  cairo (12d521df8acc483b2daa844d4f05dc2fe2765ba6)
  pixman (2f4f2fb4859931bf6dc5632d8c919e7296736427)

***** NOTE FOR VISUAL C++ 6.0 *****

VC6 is not supported.  Please upgrade to VC8.

==== Patches ====

Some specific things:

max-font-size.patch: Clamp freetype font size to 1000 to avoid overflow issues

nonfatal-assertions.patch: Make assertions non-fatal

buggy-repeat.patch: Unconditionally turn on buggy-repeat handling to bandaid bug 413583.

cairo-version-fixes.patch: fix up cairo-version.c/cairo-version.h for in-place builds

win32-ddb-dib.patch: fix for bug 455513; not upstream yet pending feebdack

win32-vertically-offset-glyph.patch: bug 454098; vertical positioning errors when drawing glyph runs including delta-y offsets on screen via GDI

ignore-rank0.patch: bug 474886; Not redrawing the background when changing page on flickr

win32-canvas-glyph-position.patch: bug 475092; horizontal positioning errors when drawing glyph runs with delta-y offsets to canvas through win32-font

win32-cleartype-clipping.patch: bug 445087; some glyphs are clipped, mainly on right-hand edge, when ClearType is enabled and drawing to RGBA canvas

on-edge.patch: reverts the in-fill semantic change.

wrap-source_image.patch: make sure we don't free the source image until we're done with it.

zero-sized.patch: deal with zero sized surface in ways less likely to crash.

text-path-filling-threshold.patch: use path filling instead of platform glyph rasterization at a smaller size threshold of 256 device pixels, if the backend supports native filling (which we assume will be fast).

zombie-face.patch: bug 486974; leak and possible crash with @font-face{src:url()}.  Upstream commit: 0238fe2cafea2e1ed19bb222117bd73ee6898d4d

win32-raster.patch: bug 498689; use scanline rasterizer on win32

quartz-falback.patch: try to fix Quartz fallback-to-pixman path; possiby incorrect and obsoleted by Andrea Canciani patch

quartz-repeating-radial-gradients.patch: use Quartz to render repeating radial gradients instead of falling back

quartz-first-stop.patch: return the first stop for negative positions on the gradient line of a nonrepeating linear gradient

quartz-glyph-extents.patch: bug 534260; work around incorrect glyph extents returned by quartz for anomalous empty glyphs

quartz-state.patch: bug 522859; refactor cairo-quartz-surface so that state local to a drawing operation is stored in a cairo_quartz_drawing_state_t instead of the surface

quartz-cache-CGImageRef.patch: cache CGImageRef for a CGBitmapContext; when we reuse it, Quartz will cache stuff, improving performance

quartz-remove-snapshot.patch: remove broken implementation of backend snapshot

quartz-cglayers.patch: add support for cairo surfaces backed by CGLayers

quartz-cglayers-fix-fallback.patch: Bug 572912; fix bug in fallback code in previous patch
