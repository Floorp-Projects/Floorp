Any changes to Skia should have at a minimum both a Mozilla bug tagged with the [skia-upstream]
whiteboard tag, and also an upstream bug and review request. Any patches that do ultimately land
in mozilla-central must be reviewed by a Skia submodule peer.

See https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Core#Graphics for current peers.

In most cases the patch will need to have an r+ from upstream before it is eligible to land here.
