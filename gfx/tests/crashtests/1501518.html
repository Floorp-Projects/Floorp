<!-- Add a few levels of blur to put as at an earlier render pass than the rest of the browser UI.
     We then trigger a render pass with a larger border and a small rectangle. The border gets drawn
     in this pass because it goes into the texture cache, and the rectangle gets drawn in this pass
     because it gets an additional blur. A large item drawn to the texture cache in a pass where
     the other objects are small will trigger the allocation of a render target that's smaller than
     the large item, which is fine but triggered a panic before this bug was fixed.
