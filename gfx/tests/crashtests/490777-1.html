<!-- This crashed on Mac OS X with the modified ATSUI font backend implemented in
     bug 481948. Crash occurs due to an unpaired low surrogate in text with the
     right-to-left direction override; this cannot occur in direct HTML content
     because the unpaired surrogate will be replaced with U+FFFD, but it can be
     generated from Javascript. -->
