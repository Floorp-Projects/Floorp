gfx/harfbuzz status as of 2018-06-12:

This directory contains the HarfBuzz source from the 'master' branch of
https://github.com/behdad/harfbuzz.

Current version: 1.8.1

UPDATING:

Our in-tree copy of HarfBuzz does not depend on any generated files from the
upstream build system. Therefore, it should be sufficient to simply overwrite
the in-tree files one the updated ones from upstream to perform updates.

If the collection of source files changes, manual updates to moz.build may be
needed as we don't use the upstream makefiles.
