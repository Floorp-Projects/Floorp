This directory contains the HarfBuzz source from the upstream repo:
https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz

Current version: 3.1.2 [commit 8aed5c21a31eece6a9f3cd775fda8facb6c28b9b]

!!!Please Note!!!
Because LLVM added in D100581 support for -Wunused-but-set-parameter and -Wunused-but-set-variable
and clang doesn't cope well with `#pragma GCC diagnostic warning` vs gcc we had to patch this version up.
The same patch was upstream in #2995 so, starting with the next version, the current patch will no longer
be needed.

UPDATING:

Our in-tree copy of HarfBuzz does not depend on any generated files from the
upstream build system. Therefore, it should be sufficient to simply overwrite
the in-tree files one the updated ones from upstream to perform updates.

To simplify this, the in-tree copy can be updated by running
  sh update.sh
from within the gfx/harfbuzz directory.

If the collection of source files changes, manual updates to moz.build may be
needed as we don't use the upstream makefiles.
