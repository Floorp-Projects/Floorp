   * the e10s content process if printing output can't otherwise be transfered
   * over to the parent process using the normal DrawTarget type.

   * NOTE: this should only be called between BeginPage()/EndPage() calls, and
   * the returned DrawTarget should not be drawn to after EndPage() has been
   * called.
   *
   * XXX For consistency with the old code this takes a size parameter even
   * though we already have the size passed to our subclass's CreateOrNull
   * factory methods.  The size passed to the factory method comes from
   * nsIDeviceContextSpec::MakePrintTarget overrides, whereas the size
   * passed to us comes from nsDeviceContext::CreateRenderingContext.  In at
   * least one case (nsDeviceContextSpecAndroid::MakePrintTarget) these are
   * different.  At some point we should align the two sources and get rid of
   * this method's size parameter.
   *
   * XXX For consistency with the old code this returns a new DrawTarget for
   * each call.  Perhaps we can create and cache a DrawTarget in our subclass's
   * CreateOrNull factory methods and return that on each call?  Currently that
   * seems to cause Mochitest failures on Windows though, which coincidentally
   * is the only platform where we get passed an aRecorder.  Probably the
   * issue is that we get called more than once with a different aRecorder, so
   * storing one recording DrawTarget for our lifetime doesn't currently work.
   *
   * XXX Could we pass aRecorder to our subclass's CreateOrNull factory methods?
   * We'd need to check that our consumers always pass the same aRecorder for
   * our entire lifetime.
   *
   * XXX Once PrintTargetThebes is removed this can become non-virtual.
   *
   * XXX In the long run, this class and its sub-classes should be converted to
   * use STL classes and mozilla::RefCounted<> so the can be moved to Moz2D.
