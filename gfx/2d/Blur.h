/**
 * Implementation of a triple box blur approximation of a Gaussian blur.
 *
 * A Gaussian blur is good for blurring because, when done independently
 * in the horizontal and vertical directions, it matches the result that
 * would be obtained using a different (rotated) set of axes.  A triple
 * box blur is a very close approximation of a Gaussian.
 *
 * This is a "service" class; the constructors set up all the information
 * based on the values and compute the minimum size for an 8-bit alpha
 * channel context.
 * The callers are responsible for creating and managing the backing surface
 * and passing the pointer to the data to the Blur() method.  This class does
 * not retain the pointer to the data outside of the Blur() call.
 *
 * A spread N makes each output pixel the maximum value of all source
 * pixels within a square of side length 2N+1 centered on the output pixel.
 */

   * @param aRect The coordinates of the surface to create in device units.

   *   approximately 1/3 this value, or diameter approximately 2/3 this value.
   *   This parameter should nearly always be computed using
   * CalculateBlurRadius, below.
   *
   * @param aDirtyRect A pointer to a dirty rect, measured in device units, if
   *   available.  This will be used for optimizing the blur operation. It is

   *   represents an area where blurring is unnecessary and shouldn't be done
   * for speed reasons. It is safe to pass nullptr here.
