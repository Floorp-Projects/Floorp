// Represents a native layer. Native layers, such as CoreAnimation layers on
// macOS, are used to put pixels on the screen and to refresh and manipulate

// once and then displaying the layer for multiple frames while moving it to
// different positions will be more efficient than drawing into a window (or a
// non-moving layer) multiple times with different internal offsets.
// There are two sources of "work" for a given composited frame: 1) Our own
// drawing (such as OpenGL compositing into a window or layer) and 2) the
// compositing window manager's work to update the screen. Every pixel we draw
// needs to be copied to the screen by the window manager. This suggests two
// avenues for reducing the work load for a given frame: Drawing fewer pixels
// ourselves, and making the window manager copy fewer pixels to the screen.
// Smart use of native layers allows reducing both work loads: If a visual
// change can be expressed purely as a layer attribute change (such as a change
// in the layer's position), this lets us eliminate our own drawing for that
// change. And secondly, manipulating a small layer rather than a large layer
// will reduce the window manager's work for that frame because it'll only copy
// the pixels of the small layer to the screen.
