Here is some text to stare at as the test runs. It serves no functional
purpose, but gives you an idea of the zoom level. It's harder to tell what
the zoom level is when the page is just solid white.
<select id='select' style="position: absolute; left:150px; top:300px;"><option>he he he</option><option>boo boo</option><option>baz baz</option></select>

  // Silence SimpleTest warning about missing assertions by having it wait
  // indefinitely. We don't need to give it an explicit finish because the
  // entire window this test runs in will be closed after subtestDone is called.
  SimpleTest.waitForExplicitFinish();
