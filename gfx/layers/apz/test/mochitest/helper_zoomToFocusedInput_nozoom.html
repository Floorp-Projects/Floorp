/* This test does not always exercise the bug it was written for, in the sense
   that the test would fail without the corresponding patch. It seems as though
   when hitting bug 1743602 the test does not exercise the bug. If bug 1743602
   gets fixed hopefully this test will end up exercising the bug. A dev pixel
   ratio of 1 seems to make it hard (but not impossible) for the test to
   exercise the bug. This is what you get when running the emulator locally or
   in our CI infrastructure. A dev pixel ratio of ~2.6 (23 appunits = 1 dev
   pixel) seems to make it easier (but not 100%) for the test to exercise the
   bug. This is what I got when running the test on a real phone locally (pixel 2).
