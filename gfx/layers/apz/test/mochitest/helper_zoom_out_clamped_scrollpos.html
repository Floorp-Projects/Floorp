      // from the top-left quadrant of the screen to the bottom-right, so that
      // the scroll position never changes from 0,0. If we move either finger
      // upwards at all, the synthesization can generate intermediate touch
      // events with just that change which can cause the page to scroll down
      // which we don't want here.

      // position at 0,0, which in terms of the bug, means that only the first
      // repaint request actually takes effect and the rest are discarded.

      // and therefore after the pinch is done, the zoom ends up stuck there
      // instead of going all the way back to 1.0 like we would expect.
