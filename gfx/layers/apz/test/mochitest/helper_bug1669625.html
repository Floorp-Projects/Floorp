  // scrolling after this we don't get any SchedulePaint calls. The way that we
  // test that is to use checkAndClearDisplayListState on the document element
  // to make sure it didn't have display list building ran for it. The
  // synthesizeKey calls above will end up in ScrollFrameHelper::ScrollBy,
  // which calls SchedulePaint in order to pass the scroll to the compositor to
  // perform. That SchedulePaint will result in display list building for the
  // document element, and that's okay, but we want to call
  // checkAndClearDisplayListState (to clear the display list building state)
  // right after that display list building, so that we can observe if any
  // display list building happens after it. That way that we do that is a rAF,
  // which runs immediately before painting, and then a setTimeout from the
  // rAF, which should run almost immediately after painting. Then we wait for
  // a scroll event, this scroll event is triggered by the compositor updating
  // the main thread scroll position. And here is where we finally get to what
  // we want to actually test. The original bug came about when the main
  // thread, while processing the repaint request from the compositor, called
  // SchedulePaint, and hence caused display list building. So we want to check
  // that the refresh driver tick after the scroll event does not do any
  // display list building. We again use a setTimeout from a rAF to run right
  // after the paint and check that there was no display list building.
