/**
 * This class manages the tree of AsyncPanZoomController instances. There is one
 * instance of this class owned by each CompositorBridgeParent, and it contains
 * as many AsyncPanZoomController instances as there are scrollable container
 * layers. This class generally lives on the updater thread, although some
 * functions may be called from other threads as noted; thread safety is ensured
 * internally.
 *
 * The bulk of the work of this class happens as part of the
 * UpdateHitTestingTree function, which is when a layer tree update is received
 * by the compositor. This function walks through the layer tree and creates a
 * tree of HitTestingTreeNode instances to match the layer tree and for use in
 * hit-testing on the controller thread. APZC instances may be preserved across
 * calls to this function if the corresponding layers are still present in the
 * layer tree.
 *
 * The other functions on this class are used by various pieces of client code
 * to notify the APZC instances of events relevant to them. This includes, for
 * example, user input events that drive panning and zooming, changes to the
 * scroll viewport area, and changes to pan/zoom constraints.
 *
 * Note that the ClearTree function MUST be called when this class is no longer
 * needed; see the method documentation for details.
 *
 * Behaviour of APZ is controlled by a number of preferences shown
 * \ref APZCPrefs "here".

   * first APZC to scroll may not be the one that is receiving the touch events.
   *
   * |aPrev| is the APZC that received the touch events triggering the scroll
   *   (in the case of an initial scroll), or the last APZC to scroll (in the
   *   case of overscroll)
   * |aStartPoint| and |aEndPoint| are in |aPrev|'s transformed screen
   *   coordinates (i.e. the same coordinates in which touch points are given to
   *   APZCs). The amount of (over)scroll is represented by two points rather
   *   than a displacement because with certain 3D transforms, the same
   *   displacement between different points in transformed coordinates can
   *   represent different displacements in untransformed coordinates.
   * |aOverscrollHandoffChain| is the overscroll handoff chain used for
   *   determining the order in which scroll should be handed off between
   *   APZCs
   * |aOverscrollHandoffChainIndex| is the next position in the overscroll
   *   handoff chain that should be scrolled.
   *
   * aStartPoint and aEndPoint will be modified depending on how much of the
   * scroll each APZC consumes. This is to allow the sending APZC to go into
   * an overscrolled state if no APZC further up in the handoff chain accepted
   * the entire scroll.
   *
   * The function will return true if the entire scroll was consumed, and
   * false otherwise. As this function also modifies aStartPoint and aEndPoint,
   * when scroll is consumed, it should always the case that this function
   * returns true if and only if IsZero(aStartPoint - aEndPoint), using the
   * modified aStartPoint and aEndPoint after the function returns.
   *
   * The way this method works is best illustrated with an example.
   * Consider three nested APZCs, A, B, and C, with C being the innermost one.
   * Say B is scroll-grabbing.
   * The touch events go to C because it's the innermost one (so e.g. taps
   * should go through C), but the overscroll handoff chain is B -> C -> A
   * because B is scroll-grabbing.
   * For convenience I'll refer to the three APZC objects as A, B, and C, and
   * to the tree manager object as TM.
   * Here's what happens when C receives a touch-move event:
   *   - C.TrackTouch() calls TM.DispatchScroll() with index = 0.
   *   - TM.DispatchScroll() calls B.AttemptScroll() (since B is at index 0 in
   *     the chain).
   *   - B.AttemptScroll() scrolls B. If there is overscroll, it calls
   *     TM.DispatchScroll() with index = 1.
   *   - TM.DispatchScroll() calls C.AttemptScroll() (since C is at index 1 in
   *     the chain)
   *   - C.AttemptScroll() scrolls C. If there is overscroll, it calls
   *     TM.DispatchScroll() with index = 2.
   *   - TM.DispatchScroll() calls A.AttemptScroll() (since A is at index 2 in
   *     the chain)
   *   - A.AttemptScroll() scrolls A. If there is overscroll, it calls
   *     TM.DispatchScroll() with index = 3.
   *   - TM.DispatchScroll() discards the rest of the scroll as there are no
   *     more elements in the chain.
   *
   * Note: this should be used for panning only. For handing off overscroll for
   *       a fling, use DispatchFling().
