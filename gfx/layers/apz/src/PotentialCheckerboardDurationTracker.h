 * actually happening, since by definition it could potentially be happening.
 * The second set is that in which the APZC is actively transforming content
 * in the compositor, since it could potentially transform it so as to display
 * checkerboarding to the user.
 * The caller of this class calls the appropriate methods to indicate the start
 * and stop of these two sets, and this class manages accumulating the union
