  // The deferred transform item is used when building the WebRenderScrollData
  // structure. The backstory is that APZ needs to know about transforms that
  // apply to the different APZC instances. Prior to bug 1423370, we would do
  // this by creating a new WebRenderLayerScrollData for each nsDisplayTransform
  // item we encountered. However, this was unnecessarily expensive because it
  // turned out a lot of nsDisplayTransform items didn't have new ASRs defined
  // as descendants, so we'd create the WebRenderLayerScrollData and send it
  // over to APZ even though the transform information was not needed in that
  // case.
  //
  // In bug 1423370 and friends, this was optimized by "deferring" a
  // nsDisplayTransform item when we encountered it during display list
  // traversal. If we found a descendant of that transform item that had a
  // new ASR or otherwise was "relevant to APZ", we would then pluck the
  // transform matrix off the deferred item and put it on the
  // WebRenderLayerScrollData instance created for that APZ-relevant descendant.
  //
  // One complication with this is if there are multiple nsDisplayTransform
  // items in the ancestor chain for the APZ-relevant item. As we traverse the
  // display list, we will defer the outermost nsDisplayTransform item, and when
  // we encounter the next one we will need to merge it with the already-
  // deferred one somehow. What we do in this case is have
  // mDeferredTransformItem always point to the "innermost" deferred transform
  // item (i.e. the closest ancestor nsDisplayTransform item of the item that
  // created this StackingContextHelper). And then we use
  // mDeferredAncestorTransform to store the product of all the other transforms
  // that were deferred. As a result, there is an invariant here that if
  // mDeferredTransformItem is nullptr, mDeferredAncestorTransform will also
  // be Nothing(). Note that we can only do this if the nsDisplayTransform items
  // share the same ASR. If we are processing an nsDisplayTransform item with a
  // different ASR than the previously-deferred item, we assume that the
  // previously-deferred transform will get sent to APZ as part of a separate
  // WebRenderLayerScrollData item, and so we don't need to bother with any
  // merging. (The merging probably wouldn't even make sense because the
  // coordinate spaces might be different in the face of async scrolling). This
  // behaviour of forcing a WebRenderLayerScrollData item to be generated when
  // the ASR changes is implemented in
  // WebRenderCommandBuilder::CreateWebRenderCommandsFromDisplayList.
