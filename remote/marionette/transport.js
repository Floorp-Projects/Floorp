/**
 * An adapter that handles data transfers between the debugger client
 * and server. It can work with both nsIPipe and nsIServerSocket
 * transports so long as the properly created input and output streams
 * are specified.  (However, for intra-process connections,
 * LocalDebuggerTransport, below, is more efficient than using an nsIPipe
 * pair with DebuggerTransport.)
 *
 * @param {nsIAsyncInputStream} input
 *     The input stream.
 * @param {nsIAsyncOutputStream} output
 *     The output stream.
 *
 * Given a DebuggerTransport instance dt:
 * 1) Set dt.hooks to a packet handler object (described below).
 * 2) Call dt.ready() to begin watching for input packets.
 * 3) Call dt.send() / dt.startBulkSend() to send packets.
 * 4) Call dt.close() to close the connection, and disengage from
 *    the event loop.
 *
 * A packet handler is an object with the following methods:
 *
 * - onPacket(packet) - called when we have received a complete packet.
 *   |packet| is the parsed form of the packet --- a JavaScript value, not
 *   a JSON-syntax string.
 *
 * - onBulkPacket(packet) - called when we have switched to bulk packet
 *   receiving mode. |packet| is an object containing:
 *   * actor:  Name of actor that will receive the packet
 *   * type:   Name of actor's method that should be called on receipt
 *   * length: Size of the data to be read
 *   * stream: This input stream should only be used directly if you
 *             can ensure that you will read exactly |length| bytes and
 *             will not close the stream when reading is complete
 *   * done:   If you use the stream directly (instead of |copyTo|
 *             below), you must signal completion by resolving/rejecting
 *             this deferred.  If it's rejected, the transport will
 *             be closed.  If an Error is supplied as a rejection value,
 *             it will be logged via |dump|.  If you do use |copyTo|,
 *             resolving is taken care of for you when copying completes.
 *   * copyTo: A helper function for getting your data out of the
 *             stream that meets the stream handling requirements above,
 *             and has the following signature:
 *
 *             @param nsIAsyncOutputStream {output}
 *                 The stream to copy to.
 *
 *             @return {Promise}
 *                 The promise is resolved when copying completes or
 *                 rejected if any (unexpected) errors occur.  This object
 *                 also emits "progress" events for each chunk that is
 *                 copied.  See stream-utils.js.
 *
 * - onClosed(reason) - called when the connection is closed. |reason|
 *   is an optional nsresult or object, typically passed when the
 *   transport is closed due to some error in a underlying stream.
 *
 * See ./packets.js and the Remote Debugging Protocol specification for
 * more details on the format of these packets.
