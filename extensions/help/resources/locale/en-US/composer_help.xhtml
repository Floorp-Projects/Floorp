<h2>Creating a New Page</h2>

<p>Composer is an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) editor that allows 
  you to create and edit web pages. Composer is a <i>WYSIWYG</i> (What You See 
  Is What You Get) editor, so you can display how your page will look to the reader 
  as you're creating it. It is not necessary for you to know HTML, since most 
  of the basic HTML functions are available as commands from the toolbars and 
  menus. However, Composer also lets you edit the HTML source if you want. 
<p>To create a web page, use one of the methods described below. Once you've started 
  a page, you can add and edit text just as you would in a word processor.</p>
<p><b>To create a new page from the Navigator browser</b>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open the File menu, choose New, and then choose Blank Page to Edit. A Composer 
    window containing a blank page opens.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To edit a page you're currently browsing in Navigator</b>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Navigator window of the page you're viewing, open the File menu and 
    choose Edit Page. You see a Composer window that contains the page you're 
    viewing.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To create a new page in Composer</b>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click the New button in Composer's toolbar.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To start from an HTML file stored on your local drive</b>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Tasks menu and choose Composer. You see the Composer window.</li>
  <li>Open the File menu and choose Open File. You see the Open HTML File dialog box.</li>
  <li>On your local drive, locate the file that you want to edit.</li>
  <li>Click Open to display the specified file in a Composer window.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Tip</b>: You can also open JavaScript files so that you can edit them in 
  Composer. 
<p><b>To edit a web page</b>: 
<ol>
  <li>Open the Tasks menu and choose Navigator. 
  <li>Go to a web page by typing the URL of the page (for example,<i> www.netscape.com</i>) 
    in the Location Bar and pressing Enter (Return on Macintosh OS). 
  <li>Open the File menu and choose Edit Page. 
    <p><b>Note</b>: Keep in mind that when you save this page, the HTML part of 
      the page is saved locally, on your hard drive. Other files, such as images 
      and sound files, are not saved. If an image location is static (starts with 
      &quot;http://&quot;) and you are connected to the Internet, you will still 
      see that image in the document in Composer and Navigator. 
</ol>
<p><b>Tip</b>: In the Composer window you can quickly open the most recent file 
  you've been working on by opening the File menu, choosing Recent Pages, and 
  then selecting the file you want from the list.

<a NAME="browse_new_page"></a> 
<h2>Saving and Browsing Your New Page</h2>
<p>You can save Composer documents in HTML and text-only format. Saving a document 
  in HTML format preserves the document's formatting, such as text styles (for 
  example, bold or italic), tables, links, and images. Saving a document in text-only 
  format removes all the HTML tags but preserves the document's text. 
<p>To save a document as an HTML file: 
<ul>
  <li>Open the File menu and choose Save. If you haven't already given your page 
    a title, Composer prompts you to do so. Composer displays the page title in 
    the browser window's title bar when you view the page in the browser. The 
    document's page title also appears in your list of bookmarks if you bookmark 
    the page. 
    <p>Composer then prompts you to enter a filename and specify the location where 
      you want to save the file. Make sure you preserve the .html extension in 
      the filename.
</ul>
<p>To change the filename or location of an existing HTML file:</p>
  <ul><li>Choose Save As and select a different filename or location.</li></ul>

<p>To save a document as a text-only file: 
<ol>
  <li>Open the File menu and choose Export to Text. 
  <li>Enter the filename and specify the location where you want to save the file. 
</ol>
<p><b>Tip</b>: You can choose Revert to Last Saved from the File menu to retrieve 
  the most recently saved copy of the document in which you're working. Keep in 
  mind that your current changes will be lost. 
<p><b>Note</b>: Images do not show in documents saved in the text-only format. 
<p> 
<p>To view your page in a browser window in order to test your links: 
<ul>
  <li>Open the File menu and choose Browse Page (or click Browse in the Composition 
    toolbar). If you have not yet saved your document, Composer prompts you to 
    enter a page title, filename, and location. The Composer window remains open 
    behind the new Navigator window. </li>
</ul>

<a name="Composer:formatting_listsIDX"></a> <a NAME="PROPERTIES_PARAGRAPH"></a> 
<h2>Formatting Paragraphs, Headings, and Lists</h2>
<p>To apply a format to a paragraph, begin from the Composer window: 
<ol>
  <li>Click to place the insertion point (also known as the caret) where you want the format 
    to begin, or select the text you want to format. 
  <li>Choose a paragraph format using the drop-down list in the Format toolbar: 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Body Text</b>: Applies the application default font and style for 
        regular text, without affecting the spacing before or after the text. 
      <li><b>Heading 1</b> - <b>Heading 6</b>: Formats the paragraph as a heading. 
        Heading 1 is a top-level heading, while Heading 6 is the lowest-level 
        heading. 
      <li><b>Paragraph</b>: Inserts a paragraph tag (use this to begin a new paragraph). 
        The paragraph includes top and bottom margins. 
      <li><b>Address</b>: Can be used for a web page "signature" that indicates 
        the author of the page and the person to contact for more information, 
        for example: 
        <address>user@example.com</address>
        You might want to include the date and a copyright notice. This format 
        usually appears at the bottom of the web page under a horizontal line. 
        Navigator displays the address format in italics.</li>
      <li><b>Preformat</b>: This is useful for elements such as code examples, 
        column data, and mail messages that you want displayed in a fixed-width 
        font. In normal text, most browsers remove extra spaces, tabs, and paragraph 
        returns. However, text that uses the Preformatted style is displayed with 
        the white space intact, preserving the layout of the original text.</li>
      <li><b>Blockquote</b>: Choose this format to indent quoted text on both 
        the left and right.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
<p>To format text as a heading: 
<ol>
  <li>Click to place the insertion point anywhere within the text that you want to 
    format. 
  <li>Using the drop-down list in the Format toolbar, choose the level of heading 
    you want, from 1 (largest) to 6 (smallest). For example, choose "Heading 1" 
    for your main heading, "Heading 2" for the next level, and so forth.</li>
</ol>
<p>To apply a list item format: 
<ol>
  <li>Click to place the insertion point within the line of text that you want to 
    format. 
  <li>Open the Format menu and choose List. 
  <li>Choose the list style: 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Bulleted</b>: Each item has a bullet (dot) next to it (as in this 
        list). 
      <li><b>Numbered</b>: Items are numbered. 
      <li><b>Term</b> and <b>Definition</b>: These two styles work together, creating 
        a glossary-style appearance. Use the Term tag for the word being defined, 
        and the Definition tag for the definition. The Term text appears flush 
        left, and the Definition text appears indented. </li>
    </ul>
</ol>
<p><b>Tip</b>: You can quickly apply a list style to a block of text by selecting the text 
  and clicking the Numbered List <img src="images/numbers.gif" width=21 height=21 alt="" border="0"> 
  or Bulleted List <img src="images/bullets.gif" width=20 height=20 alt="" border="0"> 
  buttons on the Format toolbar. 
<p>To change the style of bullets or numbers: 
<ol>
  <li>Click to place the insertion point within the text of the list item you 
    want to change, or select one or more items in the list if you want to apply 
    a new style to the entire list. 
  <li>Open the Format menu and choose List Properties. 
  <li>Select a bullet or number style from the drop-down list. For numbered lists, 
    you can specify a starting number. For bulleted lists, you can change the 
    bullet style. 
</ol>
<p>To align a paragraph or text in your page, for example, centering or aligning 
  to the left or right: 
<ol>
  <li>Click to place the insertion point within the paragraph or line of text you 
    want to align. 
  <li>Open the Format menu and choose Align; then choose an alignment option. 
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can also use the Format toolbar to align text.

<a name="Composer:working_with_listsIDX"></a> <a NAME="lists"></a> 
<h2>Working with Lists</h2>
<p>To end a list and continue typing body text: 
<ol>
  <li>Click to place the insertion point at the end of the last list item and press Enter 
    (Return on Macintosh OS). 
  <li>Press Enter again. Each time you press Enter, Composer outdents one level. 
</ol>
<p>To change one or more list items to body text: 
<ol>
  <li>Click to place the insertion point within the list item, or select the list 
    items. 
  <li>In a numbered list, click the numbered list button (or in a bulleted list, 
    click the bulleted list button) in the Format toolbar. The list buttons 
    act as a toggle. 
</ol>
<p>To position indented text below a list item: 
<ol>
  <li>Click to place the insertion point within the list item. 
  <li>Press Shift-Enter to create the hanging indent. 
  <li>Type the text you want to indent. 
  <li>Press Shift-Enter to create another indented paragraph, or press Return 
    to create the next list item. 
</ol>
<p>To merge two adjacent lists: 
<ol>
  <li>Select the two lists that you want to merge. Be sure to select all of the 
    elements in both lists. Note that any text in between the two lists will also 
    become part of the merged list. 
  <li>Double-click the bulleted or numbered list button in the Format toolbar. 
</ol>
<p><b>Tip</b>: You can increase or decrease the indentation of list items, by 
  clicking on the Indent or Outdent button on the Format toolbar.</p>

<h2>Changing Text Color, Style, and Font</h2>
<p>To change the style, color, or font of selected text: 
<ol>
  <li>Select the text you want to format.</li>
  <li>Open the Format menu and choose one of the following: </li>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Font</b>: Use this to choose a font. If you prefer to use fonts specified 
      by the reader's browser, select Variable Width or Fixed Width. 
      <p><b>Note</b>: Not all fonts installed on your computer appear. Instead 
        of specifying a font that may not be available to all who view your web 
        page, it's generally best to select one of the fonts provided in the menu 
        since these fonts work on every computer. For example, the fonts Helvetica, 
        Arial, Times, and Courier generally look the same when viewed on different 
        computers. If you select a different font, it may not look the same when 
        viewed using a different computer. 
    </li>
    <li><b>Size</b>: Use this to choose a <i>relative</i> font size or select 
      an option to increase or decrease text size (relative to the surrounding 
      text). 
    <li><b>Text Style</b>: Use this to select a style, such as italic, bold, or 
      underline, or to apply a structured style, for example, Code. 
    <li><b>Text Color</b>: Use this to choose a color from the color picker. If 
      you are familiar with HTML color codes, you can type a specific code or 
      you can just type a color name (for example, "blue").</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
<p><b>Tip</b>: To quickly change the color of text to the color last used, select 
  the text, then press Shift + Click on the color picker. This is useful when 
  you want to use one color for separate lines of text.</p>
<p>You can also change the background color of the page, or use an image as a 
  background. See <a href="#DOCUMENT_PROPERTIES_APPEARANCE">Setting Page Colors 
  and Backgrounds</a>.

<h2>Inserting HTML Elements and Attributes</h2>
<p>If you understand how to work with HTML source code, you can insert additional 
  tags, style attributes, and JavaScript into your page. If you are not sure how 
  to work with HTML source code, it's best not to change it. To work with HTML 
  code, use one of these methods: 
<ul>
  <li>Place the insertion point where you want to insert the HTML code, then open 
    the Insert menu and choose HTML. In the Insert HTML dialog box, enter HTML 
    tags and text, and then click Insert. 
  <li>Select an element such as a table, named anchor, image, link, or horizontal 
    line. Double-click the element to open the associated properties dialog for that item. 
    Click Advanced Edit to open the Advanced Property Editor. You can use the 
    Advanced Property Editor to add HTML attributes and JavaScript to objects. 
  <li>Open the View menu, and choose HTML Source, or click the &lt;HTML&gt; Source 
    tab in the Edit Mode toolbar at the bottom of the Composer window. (If you 
    don't see the Edit Mode toolbar, open the View menu and choose Toolbars; then 
    make sure the Edit Mode Toolbar is checked.) 
</ul>
<a name="Composer:Advanced_Property_EditorIDX"></a> <a name="PROPERTY_EDITOR"></a> 
<h3>Using the Advanced Property Editor</h3>
<p>To add HTML attributes and JavaScript to objects such as tables, images, and 
  horizontal lines, you can use the Advanced Property Editor. 
<p><b>Note</b>: Unless you clearly understand how to add, delete, or modify HTML 
  attributes and their associated values, it's best not to do so. 
<p>If you are not currently viewing the Advanced Property Editor dialog box, follow 
  these steps: 
<ol>
  <li>From the View menu (or the Edit Mode toolbar), choose Show All Tags. 
  <li>Double-click the object that you want to modify to open its Advanced Property 
    Editor. The Advanced Property Editor has three tabs, 
    each of which lists the current properties for the selected object: 
    <ul>
      <li><b>HTML Attributes</b>: Click this tab to view or enter additional HTML 
        attributes. 
      <li><b>Inline Style</b>: Click this tab to view or enter additional CSS 
        (cascading style sheet) properties through the &lt;style&gt; attribute. 
      <li><b>JavaScript Events</b>: Click this tab to view or enter JavaScript 
        events. 
    </ul>
  <li>To edit a property or attribute any of the three lists, select the attribute 
    you want to edit. You can then edit the attribute's name or value using the 
    editable Attribute and Value fields at the bottom of the dialog box. To add 
    new attribute, type it in the Attribute field at the bottom of the dialog 
    box. The new attribute is automatically added when you click in the Value field. 
    To remove an attribute, select it in the list, and click Remove Attribute. 
    <p><b>Note</b>: Required attributes are highlighted in the Attribute list. 
  <li>Click OK to apply your changes to the Advanced Property Editor dialog box. 
  <li>Click OK again to exit the Properties dialog box.</li>
</ol>
<p>Composer automatically places quotation marks around any attribute text.

<h2>Checking the Spelling</h2>
<p>Composer always checks the spelling starting from the beginning of your document, 
  regardless of where you place the insertion point (also known as the caret). 
<p>To check the spelling of your page: 
<ol>
  <li>Click the Spell button on the toolbar, or open the Edit menu and choose 
    Check Spelling.</li>
  <li>Use the Check Spelling dialog box to correct misspellings and to edit or 
    add words to the current spelling User Dictionary. Click Close when you are 
    done. 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Check Word</b>: Click to check the spelling of any word you type 
        in the "Change to" field.

<h2>Validating the HTML</h2>
<p>Before you put your document on a web server so that others can see it, you should first check the document's HTML formatting to make sure it conforms to web standards. Documents containing validated HTML are less likely to cause problems when viewed by different browsers. Just visually checking your web pages in Navigator doesn't ensure that your document will appear correctly when viewed in other web browsers.
<p>Composer provides a convenient way for you to check that your document conforms to W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) HTML standards. Composer uses the W3C HTML Validation Service, which checks your document's HTML syntax for correctness and provides information on how to correct errors.
<p>
<b>Note</b>: You must be connected to the Internet to use this feature.
<p>To validate your document's HTML syntax:
<ol>
<li>Open the Edit menu, and choose Validate HTML. If you have unsaved changes, Composer asks you to save them before proceeding.</li>
<li>When the W3C HTML Validation Service page appears, click "Validate this document".</li>
</ol>

<a name="Composer:editing_modesIDX"></a> <a NAME="Edit_modes"></a> 
<h2>Choosing the Right Editing Mode</h2>
<p>Typically, you won't need to change the editing mode from the default (Normal). 
  However, if you want to work with the document's HTML source code, you may want 
  to change editing modes. Composer allows you to quickly switch between four 
  "editing modes" or views. Each editing mode allows you to continue working 
  on your document, but displays varying levels of HTML tags (and tag icons). 
<p>Before you choose an editing mode: 
<ul>
  <li>Open the View menu, choose Show/Hide, and then make sure there is a checkmark 
    next to Edit Mode Toolbar. 
</ul>
<p>The Edit Mode toolbar has four tabs: 
<ul>
  <li><b>Normal</b>: This is the WYSIWYG editing mode, so you can display how 
    the document will look as you are creating it. Choose this mode to show table 
    borders and named anchor icons. All other HTML tag icons are hidden. 
  <li><b>Show All Tags</b>: Choose this mode to show table borders and all HTML 
    tag icons. 
  <li><b>&lt;HTML&gt; Source</b>: Choose this mode to view and edit the document 
    as unformatted HTML source code. When you save the document, the Normal mode 
    reappears. 
  <li><b>Preview</b>: Choose this mode to display and edit the document exactly 
    as it would appear in a browser window, except that links and JavaScript functions 
    will not be active. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note</b>: JavaScript functions, frames, links, and animated GIF files are 
  not active in any of the editing modes. To display these items in their active 
  state, click the Browse button on the Composition toolbar to load the page into 
  a browser window.</p>

<h2>Changing a Table's Properties</h2>
<p>This section describes how to modify properties that apply to an entire table 
  as well as the rows, columns, or individual cells within a table. If you are 
  not currently viewing the Table Properties dialog box, follow these steps: 
<ol>
  <li>Select the table, or click anywhere inside it.</li>
  <li>Click the Table button <img src="images/table.gif" width=25 height=26 alt="" border="0"> 
    on the toolbar, or open the Table menu and choose Table Properties. The Table 
    Properties dialog box contains two tabs: Table and Cells. 
  <li>Click the Table tab to edit these properties: 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Size</b>: Use this to specify the number of rows and columns. Enter 
        the width of the table and then choose "% of window" or "pixels." If you 
        specify width as a percentage, the table's width changes whenever the 
        Composer window's or browser window's width changes. 
      <li><b>Borders and Spacing</b>: Use this to specify, in pixels, the border 
        line width, the space between cells, and the cell padding (the space between 
        the contents of the cell and its border). 
        <p><b>Note</b>: Composer uses a dotted outline to display tables with 
          a zero border; the dotted line disappears when the page is viewed in 
          a browser. 
      <li><b>Table Alignment</b>: Use this to align the table within the page. 
        Choose an option from the drop-down list. 
      <li><b>Caption</b>: Choose the caption placement from the drop-down list. 
      <li><b>Background Color</b>: Use this to choose a color for the table background, 
        or leave it as transparent. 
    </ul>
  <li>To apply additional attributes or JavaScript events, click Advanced Edit 
    to display the <a href="#PROPERTY_EDITOR">Advanced Property Editor</a>. 
  <li>Click Apply to preview your changes without closing the dialog box, or click 
    OK to confirm them. 
</ol>
<p>To view, change, or add properties for one or more cells: 
<ol>
  <li>Select the row, column, or cell, then open the Table menu and choose Table 
    Properties. The Table Properties dialog box appears. 
  <li>Click the Cells tab to edit the following properties: 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Selection</b>: Choose Cell, Row, or Column from the drop-down list. 
        Click Previous or Next to move through rows, columns, or cells. 
      <li><b>Size</b>: Type a number for Height and Width, and then choose "% 
        of table" or "pixels." 
      <li><b>Content Alignment</b>: Select a vertical and horizontal alignment 
        type for the text or data inside each cell. 
      <li><b>Cell Style</b>: Select Header from the drop-down list for column 
        or row headers (which centers and bolds the text in the cell); otherwise 
        choose Normal. 
      <li><b>Text Wrap</b>: Select "Don't wrap" from the drop-down list to keep 
        text from wrapping to the next line unless you insert a paragraph break. 
        Otherwise, choose Wrap. 
      <li><b>Background Color</b>: Select a color for the cell background or leave 
        it as transparent. 
    </ul>
    <p><b>Note</b>: To apply additional attributes or JavaScript events, click 
      Advanced Edit to display the <a href="#PROPERTY_EDITOR">Advanced Property 
      Editor</a> 
  <li>Click Apply to preview your changes without closing the dialog box, or click 
    OK to confirm them. 
</ol>
<p><b>Tip</b>: To change the text color or background color of one or 
  more selected cells or the entire table, select the cells or click anywhere 
  in the table and then click the text color or background color icon in the Format 
  toolbar. 
<p><b>Tip</b>: To change the color of cells to the color last used, select 
  the cell, then press Shift + Click on the background color picker. This is useful 
  when you want to use one color for individual cells. </p>

<a NAME="addtable"></a> 
<h2>Adding and Deleting Rows, Columns, and Cells</h2>
<p>Composer allows you to quickly add or delete one or more cells in your table. 
  In addition, you can set options that allow you to maintain the original rectangular 
  structure or layout of the table while you perform editing tasks. 
<p>To add a cell, row, or column to your table:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click inside the table where you want to add a cell (or cells).</li>
  <li>Open the Table menu and then choose Insert. 
  <li>Choose one of the cell groupings. (You can also insert a new table within 
    a table cell.)</li>
</ol>
<p>To delete a cell, row, or column:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click a row, column, or cell to place the insertion point. Or, select neighboring 
    cells to delete more than one row at a time. To select neighboring cells, 
    hold down the Ctrl key (Windows and Linux) or the Command key (Macintosh OS) 
    while dragging over the cells you want to select. To select individual cells 
    in a table, hold down the Ctrl key and click on the cells you want to select.</li>
  <li>Open the Table menu and choose Delete. 
  <li>Choose the item you want to delete.</li>
</ol>
<p>To join (or merge) a cell with the cell on its right: 
<ul>
  <li>Click inside the cell on the left, open the Table menu, and choose Join 
    with Cell to the Right. 
</ul>
<p>To join (or merge) adjacent cells: 
<ul>
  <li>Select adjacent cells by holding down the Ctrl key (Windows and Linux) or 
    the Command key (Macintosh OS), and then dragging over the adjacent cells that you 
    want to join. 
  <li>Open the Table menu, and choose Join Selected Cells. 
</ul>
<p>To split a joined cell back into two or more cells: 
<ul>
  <li>Click inside the cell, open the Table menu, and then choose Split Cell. 
    The contents of the cell will be in one cell. 
</ul>
<p> Refer to <A HREF="#TABLE_SELECTION">Selecting Table Elements</A> for information 
  on how to select non-adjacent cells, rows, and columns. 
<a NAME="table_editing_default"></a>
<h3>Changing the Default Table Editing Behavior</h3>
<p>By default, when you delete one or more cells, Composer preserves the table's 
  structure by adding cells at the end of a row, wherever needed. This allows 
  you to delete one or more cells but still maintain the table's original rectangular 
  layout, or structure. Otherwise, deleting cells can result in a table with empty 
  spaces, or whose outline appears irregular due to an uneven number of cells. 
<p>To change the default table editing behavior, begin from the Composer window: 
<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu, choose Preferences, and then choose Composer. 
  <li>Under Table Editing, set the following preferences: 
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure that "Maintain table layout when inserting or deleting cells" 
        is checked to ensure that you don't get an irregularly-shaped table. 
      <li>Choose the way the Delete key will behave (remove an entire cell or 
        just remove the cell's contents). 
    </ul>
  <li>Click OK.
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="TABLE_SELECTION"></a> 
<h2>Selecting Table Elements</h2>
<p>You can use one of two ways to quickly select a table, cell, or group of cells: 
<ul>
  <li>Click in the table, open the Table menu, choose Select, and then choose an item from the submenu. 
    For example, to select a table, click anywhere inside the table, open the 
    Table menu, and then choose Select Table. 
  <li>Or, you can use the mouse as a selection tool: 
    <ul>
      <li>To select the content inside one or more cells, click inside the cell 
        and drag to select the number of cells you want. You can apply a text 
        format (for example, text style or color) to the selected content. 
      <li>To select a group of adjacent cells: click in a cell, then press Ctrl 
        (Windows or Linux) or Command (Macintosh OS) and drag to select the number 
        of cells you want. Drag the mouse left or right to select a row; up or 
        down to select a column. 
      <li>To select non-adjacent cells: press Ctrl (Windows or Linux) or Command 
        (Macintosh OS) and then click inside a cell. Keep pressing Ctrl (Windows 
        or Linux) or Command (Macintosh OS) as you click to select additional cells. 
      <li>To extend a selection to include adjacent cells: press Ctrl (Windows 
        or Linux) or Command (Macintosh OS) and then click inside a cell. Then press 
        Shift as you click additional cells to extend the selection. Repeat this 
        procedure to select multiple, non-adjacent blocks of cells. 
      <li>To select one or more adjacent columns or rows: press Ctrl-Shift (Windows 
        or Linux) or Command-Shift (Macintosh OS) and drag up or down to select the 
        first column or row. Drag left or right to select additional adjacent 
        columns or rows.

<h2>Converting Text into a Table</h2>
<p>To convert text into a table: 
<ol>
  <li>Select the text that you want to convert into a table. Keep in mind that 
    Composer creates a new table row for each paragraph in the selection. 
  <li>Open the Table menu and choose Create Table from Selection. You see the Convert to Table dialog box.
  <li>Choose the character Composer uses to separate the selection into columns, 
    or specify a different character to use. If you choose Space as the separator for columns, choose whether or not you want Composer to 
	ignore multiple space and treat them as one space.
  <li>Leave "Delete separator character" checked to have Composer remove the separator 
    character when it converts the text into a table. If you don't want Composer 
    to delete the separator character, uncheck this option.

  <li>Click the Image button <img src="images/image.gif" width=23 height=25 alt="" border="0">

</ol>
<p><b>Tip</b>: To quickly insert an image: Drag and drop it onto your page. 
<p><b>Tip</b>: While typing in a paragraph that contains one or more images, if

<h2>Editing Image Properties</h2>
<p>Once you've inserted an image into your page, you can edit its properties and 
  customize the layout in your page, such as the height, width, spacing, and text 
  alignment. If you are not currently viewing the Image Properties dialog box, follow 
  these steps: 
<p>To edit the properties for a selected image: 
<ol>
  <li>Double-click the image, or select it and click the Image button <img src="images/image.gif" width=23 height=25 alt="" border="0"> 
    on the toolbar to display the Image Properties dialog box. Click More Properties 
    to expand the list of settings. To collapse the list of settings, click Fewer 
    Properties. 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Image URL</b>: Type the filename and location of the image file. 
        Click Choose File to search for an image file on your hard drive or network. 
		<li><b>URL is relative to page location</b>: If checked, Composer converts the URL to be relative to the page's location. This is especially useful if you plan to copy your pages to a web server so that others can view them. Using relative URLs allows you to keep all your linked files in the same place relative to each other, regardless of their location on your hard disk or a web server. Unchecking this box causes Composer to convert the URL to a full (absolute) URL. You typically use absolute URLs when linking to images on other web servers (not stored locally on your hard disk). If you have unsaved changes, you must first save the page in order to enable this checkbox.
      <li><b>Alternate Text</b>: Enter text that will display in place of the 
        original image; for example, a caption or a brief description of the image. 
        It's a good practice to specify alternate text for readers who use text-only 
        web browsers or who have image loading turned off. 
		 <li><strong>Don't use alternate text</strong>: Choose this option if the image does not require alternate text. 
      <li><b>Dimensions</b>: Select Custom Size, then specify the new height and 
        width, in pixels. This setting doesn't affect the original image file, 
        just the image inserted in your page. Click Actual Size to undo any changes 
        you've made to the dimensions. 
      <li><b>Constrain</b>: If you change the image size, it's a good idea to 
        check this in order to maintain the image's aspect ratio (so that it doesn't 
        appear distorted). If you choose this option, then you only need to change 
        the height or width, but not both. 
      <li><b>Align Text to Image</b>: If you've placed your image next to any 
        text, select an alignment icon to indicate how you want text positioned 
        relative to the image. 
      <li><b>Spacing</b>: Specify the amount of space surrounding the image; between 
        the image and adjoining text. You can also put a solid black border around 
        the image and specify its width in pixels. Specify zero for no border. 
      <li><b>Image Map</b>: Click Remove to remove any image map settings. 
    </ul>
  <li>To apply additional attributes or JavaScript events, click Advanced Edit

  <h2>Creating Links Within the Same Page</h2>
  <p>To create a link within the same page, for example a link that the reader 
    can use to jump from one section to another, you must create an <i>anchor</i> 
    (target location), and then create a link that points to the anchor. Anchors 
    are also called <i>named anchors</i>. 
  <ol>
    <li>Click to place the insertion point at the beginning of a line where you 
      want to create an anchor, or select some text.</li>
    <li>Click the Anchor button <img src="images/anchor.gif" width=25 height=23 alt="" border="0"> 
      on the toolbar, or open the Insert menu and choose Named Anchor. You see the Named Anchor Properties dialog box.</li>
    <li>Type a unique name for the anchor in the Anchor Name field (up to 30 characters). 
      If you include spaces, they will be converted to underscores (_).
      If you selected some text in step #1, this box already contains a name.</li>
    <li>Click OK.
      An anchor icon appears in your document to mark the anchor's location: <img src="images/anchor-in-doc.gif" width=20 height=17 alt="" border="0"></li>
  </ol>
  <p> To create the link that the reader can click to jump to the anchor: 
  <ol>
    <li>Select the text or image that you want to link to the anchor.</li>
    <li>Click the Link button or open the Insert menu and choose Link. You see the Link Properties dialog box.</li>
<ul>
	  <li>If you're creating a link to an HTML file on your computer, click Choose File to locate it.</li> 
        <li>If you're creating a link to a named 
          anchor (target), select it from the list of the anchors currently available 
          in the page. 
        <li>If you're creating a link to a level heading 
          (for example, Heading 1 - Heading 6), select it from the list of headings 
          currently available in the page. 
      </ul>
    <li>Click OK. 
  </ol>
  <p><b>Note</b>: To test the link you just created, open the File menu and choose 
    Browse Page, then click the link.</p>
<p><b>Tip</b>: If you did not first create named anchors, you can use the Link 
  dialog box to create links to headings that already occur in the page.</p>

  <h2>Creating Links to Other Pages</h2>
  <p>You can create links from your page to local pages on your own computer or 
    on your workplace's network, or to remote pages on the Internet.</p>
  <p>You can quickly create a link by dragging and dropping links and bookmarks 
    from other windows. For example, you can select a link from a web page, bookmark, 
    or Mail window and drag and drop it onto your page.</p>
  <a name="PROPERTIES_LINK"></a> 
  <p>To create a link to another page:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Click to place the insertion point where you want to create a link, or 
      select the text or image that you want to link to the anchor.</li>
    <li>Click the Link button. You see the Link Properties dialog box.</li>
  
    <li>Define your link:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Link text</b>: If you've already selected an image file or text 
          before clicking the link icon, the selected text or file will be entered 
          here. Otherwise, you must enter the text that you want to use as the 
          link. 
        <li><b>Link Location</b>: Type the local path and filename or remote URL 
          of the page you want to link to. If you're not sure of the path and 
          filename for a local file, click Choose File to look for it on your hard 
          disk or network. For remote URLs, you can copy the URL from the browser 
          location field. Alternatively, you can select a named anchor or a heading 
          in the current page that you want to link to.
		  <li><b>URL is relative to page location</b>: If checked, Composer converts the URL to be relative to the page's location. This is especially useful if you plan to copy your pages to a web server so that others can view them. Using relative URLs allows you to keep all your linked files in the same place relative to each other, regardless of their location on your hard disk or a web server. Deselecting this option causes Composer to convert the URL to a full (absolute) URL. You typically use absolute URLs when linking to pages on other web servers (not stored locally on your hard disk).

      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>Hint</b>: To copy a link on a web page, you can also right-click 
          (Control + Click on Macintosh OS) a link on a web page and choose Copy 
          Link Location.</p>

  <a NAME="Linking_images"></a> 
  <h2>Using Images as Links</h2>
  <p>You can make images, such as JPEG, GIF, or PNG files, behave like links in 
    your pages. When the reader clicks a linked image, the browser window displays 
    the page that the image is linked to.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Select an image on your page.</li>
    <li>Click the Link button <img src="images/link.gif" width=22 height=20 alt="" border="0"> 
      on the toolbar, or open the Insert menu and choose Link.</li>
    <li>Use the Link Properties dialog box to link the image to a <a href="#PROPERTIES_TARGET">named 
      anchor or heading within the page</a>, or to a <a href="#creating_links"> 
      separate local or remote page</a>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><b>Tip</b>: Drag and drop a linked image from the Navigator window into a 
    Composer window to copy both the image and the link.</p>
  <p><b>Note</b>: To remove the blue border on images used as links, open the 
    Link Properties dialog box and enter 0 in the Solid Border field.</p>
  <p> [&nbsp;<A HREF="#page_link">Return to beginning of section</A>&nbsp;] </p>
  
  <a NAME="Linking_remove"></a> 
  <h2>Removing or Discontinuing Links</h2>
  <p>To remove a link:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Select the linked text (normally blue and underlined) or image.</li>
    <li>Open the Format menu and choose Remove Links. 
  </ol>
  <p>To discontinue a link, so that text you type after the link is not included 
    as part of the link:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Click to place the insertion point where you want the link to end.</li>
    <li>Open the Format menu and choose Discontinue Link.

  <h1>Publishing Your Pages on the Web</h1>
  <p>If your pages exists only on your local hard disk, you can browse your pages, but no one else can. Composer lets you publish your pages to a remote computer called a web server. When you publish your pages to a web server, Composer copies (uploads) your pages to a computer that lets others browse your pages. To find a web server where you can publish your pages, ask your ISP or system administrator.</p>

 <p>To publish a document on a web server:</p>
 <ol>
 <li>Open the HTML document that you want to publish, or create a new Composer document.</li>
 <li>Open the File menu and choose Publish. If you have previously defined a default publishing location for this document, Composer uploads the document to the specified location. </li>
 
<ul>
 <li>If you have not defined a publishing location for this document, Composer displays the Settings tab in the Publish Page dialog box so you can enter this information. See <a href="#settings_tab">Publish Page - Settings</a> for more information.</li>
<li>If you have never saved the document, Composer displays the Publish tab in the Publish Page dialog box, so you can enter the document's file name. See <a href="#publish_tab">Publish Page - Publish</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>
 <li>To view your page, enter the page's HTTP address in Navigator's Location Bar. Test the page's links and make sure there are no missing images.</li>

  <a NAME="publish_tips"></a>
  <h3>Tips for Avoiding Broken Links or Missing Images</h3>
  <p></p>
  <ul>
<li>Make sure your Composer file names end with the .HTML file extension. Make sure your image file names end with the .JPG, .GIF, or .PNG file extension. Don't use spaces or other special symbols in your file names. Keep your file names short and use only lowercase letters and numbers.</li>
<li>If your images appear as broken links when you browse your pages on the web server, open the Image Properties dialog box for each image (by double-clicking each image in the page) and make sure you've removed the file:/// part of the URL. Once you're done correcting the links, publish your pages again.</li>
