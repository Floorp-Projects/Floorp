<h1 id="glossary">Glossary</h1>

<dl>

<dt id="authentication">authentication</dt><dd>The use of a password,
  certificate, personal identification number (PIN), or other information to
  validate an identity over a computer network. See also
  <a href="#password-based_authentication">password-based authentication</a>,
  <a href="#certificate-based_authentication">certificate-based
  authentication</a>, <a href="#client_authentication">client
  authentication</a>, <a href="#server_authentication">server
  authentication</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="bookmark">bookmark</dt><dd>A stored web page address 
  (<a href="#uniform_resource_locator">URL</a>) that you can go to easily by
  clicking a bookmark icon in the Personal Toolbar or choosing the bookmark's
  name from the Bookmarks menu.</dd>
  
<dt id="ca">CA</dt><dd>See <a href="#certificate_authority">certificate
  authority (CA)</a></dd>
  
<dt id="ca_certificate">CA certificate</dt><dd>A certificate that
  identifies a certificate authority. See also
  <a href="#certificate_authority">certificate authority (CA)</a>,
  <a href="#subordinate_ca">subordinate CA</a>, <a href="#root_ca">root
  CA</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="cache">cache</dt><dd>A collection of web page copies stored
  on your computer's hard disk or in its random-access memory (RAM). The
  browser accumulates these copies as you browse the Web. When you click a link
  or type a <a href="#uniform_resource_locator">URL</a> to fetch a particular
  web page for which the cache already contains a copy, the browser compares
  the cached copy to the original. If there have been no changes, the browser
  uses the cached copy rather than refetching the original, saving processing
  and download time.</dd>
  
<dt id="certificate">certificate</dt><dd>The digital
  equivalent of an ID card. A certificate specifies the name of an individual,
  company, or other entity and certifies that a public key, which is included
  in the certificate, belongs to that entity. When you digitally sign a message
  or other data, the digital signature for that message is created with the aid
  of the private key that corresponds to the public key in your certificate. A
  certificate is issued and digitally signed by a
<a href="#certificate_authority">certificate
  authority (CA)</a>. A certificate's validity can be verified by checking the
  CA's <a href="#digital_signature">digital signature</a>. Also called digital
  ID, digital passport, public-key certificate, X.509 certificate, and security
  certificate. See also <a href="#public-key_cryptography">public-key
  cryptography</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="certificate_authority">certificate authority (CA)</dt><dd>A service
  that issues a certificate after verifying the identity of the person or
  entity the certificate is intended to identify. A CA also renews and revokes
  certificates and generates a list of revoked certificates at regular
  intervals. CAs can be independent vendors or a person or organization using
  certificate-issuing server software (such as &brandShortName; Certificate
  Management System). See also <a href="#certificate">certificate</a>,
  <a href="#certificate_revocation_list">certificate revocation list
  (CRL)</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="certificate_backup_password">certificate backup password</dt><dd>A
  password that protects a certificate that you are backing up or have
  previously backed up. Certificate Manager asks you to set this password when
  you back up a certificate, and requests it when you attempt to restore a
  certificate that has previously been backed up.</dd>
  
<dt id="certificate-based_authentication">certificate-based
  authentication</dt><dd>Verification of identity based on certificates and
  public-key cryptography. See also
  <a href="#password-based_authentication">password-based
  authentication</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="certificate_chain">certificate chain</dt><dd>A hierarchical series of
  certificates signed by successive certificate authorities. A CA certificate
  identifies a <a href="#certificate_authority">certificate authority (CA)</a>
  and is used to sign certificates issued by that authority. A CA certificate
  can in turn be signed by the CA certificate of a parent CA and so on up to a
  <a href="#root_ca">root CA</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="certificate_fingerprint">certificate fingerprint</dt><dd>
  A unique number associated with a certificate. The number is not part of
  the certificate itself but is produced by applying a mathematical function to
  the contents of the certificate. If the contents of the certificate change,
  even by a single character, the function produces a different number.
  Certificate fingerprints can therefore be used to verify that certificates
  have not been tampered with.</dd>
  
<dt id="certificate_manager">Certificate
  Manager</dt><dd>The part of the browser that allows you to view and manage
  certificates. To view the main Certificate Manager window: Open the Edit menu
  (&brandShortName; menu on Mac OS X), choose Preferences, click Privacy and
  Security, and then click Manage Certificates.</dd>
  
<dt id="certificate_renewal">certificate renewal</dt><dd>The process of
  renewing a <a href="#certificate">certificate</a> that is about to
  expire.</dd>
  
<dt id="certificate_revocation_list">certificate revocation list
  (CRL)</dt><dd>A list of revoked certificates that is generated and signed by
  a <a href="#certificate_authority">certificate authority (CA)</a>. You can
  download the latest CRL to your browser or to a server, then check against it
  to make sure that certificates are still valid before permitting their use
  for authentication.</dd>
  
<dt id="certificate_verification">certificate verification</dt><dd>When
  <a href="#certificate_manager">Certificate Manager</a> verifies a
  certificate, it confirms that the digital signature was created by a CA whose
  own CA certificate is both on file with Certificate Manager and marked as
  trusted for issuing that kind of certificate. It also confirms that the
  certificate being verified has not itself been marked as untrusted. Finally,
  if the <a href="#online_certificate_status_protocol">Online Certificate
  Status Protocol (OCSP)</a> has been activated, Certificate Manager also
  performs an online check. It does so by looking up the certificate in a list
  of valid certificates maintained at a URL that is specified either in the
  certificate itself or in the browser's Validation preferences. If any of
  these checks fail, Certificate Manager marks the certificate as unverified
  and won't recognize the identity it certifies.</dd>
  
<dt id="cipher">cipher</dt><dd>
  See <a href="#cryptographic_algorithm">cryptographic algorithm</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="client">client</dt><dd>
  Software (such as browser software) that sends requests to and receives
  information from a <a href="#server">server</a>, which is usually running on
  a different computer. A computer on which client software runs is also
  described as a client.</dd>
<dt id="client_authentication">client authentication</dt><dd>The process of
  identifying a <a href="#client">client</a> to a <a href="#server">server</a>,
  for example with a name and password or with a
  <a href="#client_ssl_certificate">client SSL certificate</a> and some
  digitally signed data. See also <a href="#secure_sockets_layer">Secure
  Sockets Layer (SSL)</a>, <a href="#server_authentication">server
  authentication</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="client_ssl_certificate">client SSL certificate</dt><dd> A certificate
  that a <a href="#client">client</a> (such as browser software) presents to a
  <a href="#server">server</a> to authenticate the identity of the client
  (or the identity of the person using the client) using the
  <a href="#secure_sockets_layer">Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</a> protocol. See
  also <a href="#client_authentication">client authentication</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="component_bar">Component Bar</dt><dd>The toolbar located
  at the bottom left of any &brandShortName; window. The Component Bar allows you to
  switch between &brandShortName; components by clicking icons for Navigator, Mail &amp;
  Newsgroups, Instant Messenger, and so on.</dd>
  
<dt id="cookie">cookie</dt><dd>A small bit of information stored
  on your computer by some websites. When you visit such a site, the site asks
  your browser to place one or more cookies on your hard disk. Later, when you
  return to the site, your browser sends the site the cookies that belong to
  it. Cookies help websites keep track of information about you, such as the
  contents of your shopping cart. You can set your cookie preferences to
  control how cookies are used and how much information you are willing to let
  websites store on them. See also <a href="#foreign_cookie">foreign
  cookie</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="cookie_manager">Cookie Manager</dt><dd>The part of the browser
  that you can use to control <a href="#cookie">cookies</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="cryptographic_algorithm">cryptographic algorithm</dt><dd>A set of
  rules or directions used to perform cryptographic operations such as
  <a href="#encryption">encryption</a> and
  <a href="#decryption">decryption</a>. Sometimes called a <i>cipher.</i></dd>
  
<dt id="cryptography">cryptography</dt><dd>
  The art and practice of scrambling (encrypting) and unscrambling (decrypting)
  information. For example, cryptographic techniques are used to scramble an
  unscramble information flowing between commercial websites and your browser.
  See also <a href="#public-key_cryptography">public-key cryptography</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="decryption">decryption</dt><dd>
  The process of unscrambling data that has been encrypted. See also
  <a href="#encryption">encryption</a>.</dd>

<dt id="digital_id">digital ID</dt><dd>
   See <a href="#certificate">certificate</a>.</dd>
   
<dt id="digital_signature">
  digital signature</dt><dd>A code created from both the data to be
  signed and the private key of the signer. This code is unique for each new
  piece of data. Even a single comma added to a message changes the digital
  signature for that message. Successful validation of your digital signature
  by appropriate software not only provides evidence that you approved the
  transaction or message, but also provides evidence that the data has not
  changed since you digitally signed it. A digital signature has nothing to do
  with a handwritten signature, although it can sometimes be used for similar
  legal purposes. See also <a href="#nonrepudiation">nonrepudiation</a>,
  <a href="#tamper_detection">tamper detection</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="distinguished_name">distinguished name (DN)</dt><dd>A specially
  formatted name that uniquely identifies the subject of a certificate.</dd>
  
<dt id="dual_key_pairs">dual key pairs</dt><dd>Two public-private key
  pairs&mdash;four keys altogether&mdash;corresponding to two separate certificates. The
  private key of one pair is used for signing operations, and the public and
  private keys of the other pair are used for encryption and decryption
  operations. Each pair corresponds to a separate
  <a href="#certificate">certificate</a>. See also
  <a href="#public-key_cryptography">public-key cryptography</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="eavesdropping">eavesdropping</dt><dd>
  Surreptitious interception of information sent over a network by an entity
  for which the information is not intended.</dd>
  
<dt id="encryption">encryption</dt><dd>
  The process of scrambling information in a way that disguises its meaning.
  For example, encrypted connections between computers make it very difficult
  for third-parties to unscramble, or <i>decrypt,</i> information flowing over
  the connection. Encrypted information can be decrypted only by someone who
  possesses the appropriate key. See also
  <a href="#public-key_cryptography">public-key cryptography</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="encryption_certificate">encryption certificate</dt><dd>
  A <a href="#certificate">certificate</a> whose public key is used for
  encryption only. Encryption certificates are not used for signing operations.

<dt id="extensible_stylesheet_language_transformation">Extensible Stylesheet
  Language Transformation (XSLT)</dt><dd> A language used to convert an XML
  document into another XML document or into some other format.</dd>
  
<dt id="extensible_markup_language">Extensible Markup Language
  (XML)</dt><dd>An open standard for describing data. Unlike HTML, XML allows
  the developer of a web page to define special tags. For more information, see
  the online W3C document <a href="http://www.w3.org/xml/"
  target="_blank">Extensible Markup Language (XML)</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="file_transfer_protocol">File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</dt><dd>A
  standard that allows users to transfer files from one computer to another
  over a network. You can use your browser to fetch files using FTP.</dd>
  
<dt id="fingerprint">fingerprint</dt><dd>
  See <a href="#certificate_fingerprint">certificate fingerprint</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="fips_pubs_140-1">FIPS PUBS 140-1</dt><dd>Federal Information Processing
  Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) 140-1 is a US government standard for
  implementations of cryptographic modules&mdash;that is, hardware or software that
  encrypts and decrypts data or performs other cryptographic operations (such
  as creating or verifying digital signatures). Many products sold to the US
  government must comply with one or more of the FIPS standards.</dd>
  
<dt id="foreign_cookie">foreign cookie</dt><dd>A cookie from one
  site that gets stored on your computer when you visit a different site.
  Sometimes a website displays content that is hosted on another website.
  That content can be anything from an image to text or an advertisement. The
  second website that hosts such elements also has the ability to store a
  cookie in your browser, even though you don't visit it directly. Also known
  as &quot;third-party cookie.&quot;</dd>
  
<dt id="form_manager">Form Manager</dt><dd>The part of the browser
  that can help you save the personal data you enter into online forms, such as
  your name, address, phone, and so on. Then, when a website presents you with
  a form, Form Manager can fill it in automatically.</dd>
  
<dt id="helper_application">helper application</dt><dd>Any application
  that is used to open or view a file downloaded by the browser. A
  <a href="#plug-in">plug-in</a> is a special kind of helper application that
  installs itself into the Plugins directory of the main browser installation
  directory and can typically be opened within the browser itself (internally).
  Microsoft Word, Adobe Photoshop, and other external applications are
  considered helper applications but not plug-ins, since they don't install
  themselves into the browser directory, but can be opened from the download
  dialog box.</dd>
  
<dt id="home_page">home page</dt><dd>The page your browser is set
  to display every time you launch it or when you click the Home button. Also
  used to refer to the main page for a website, from which you can explore the
  rest of the site.</dd>
  
<dt id="hypertext_markup_language">Hypertext Markup Language
  (HTML)</dt><dd>The document format used for Web pages. The HTML standard
  defines tags, or codes, used to define the text layout, fonts, style, images,
  and other elements that make up a web page.</dd>
  
<dt id="implicit_consent">implicit consent</dt><dd>Also known as
  implied or &quot;opt-out&quot; consent. Used to describe privacy settings
  that may allow websites to gather information about you (for example by
  means of <a href="#cookie">cookies</a> and online forms) unless you
  explicitly choose to withhold your consent by selecting an option on a page
  that the website provides for that purpose. Your consent may not be
  requested when the information is actually gathered.</dd>
  
<dt id="internet_message_access_protocol">Internet Message Access Protocol
  (IMAP)</dt><dd>A standard mail server protocol that allows you to store all
  your messages and any changes to them on the server rather than on your
  computer's hard disk. Using IMAP rather than
  <a href="#post_office_protocol">POP</a> saves disk space and allows you to
  access your entire mailbox, including sent mail, drafts, and custom folders,
  from any location. Using an IMAP server over a modem is generally faster than
  using a POP mail server, since you initially download message headers only.
  Not all ISPs support IMAP.</dd>
  
<dt id="internet">Internet</dt><dd>A worldwide network of millions
  of computers that communicate with each other using standard protocols such
  as <a href="#transmission_control_protocol_internet_protocol">TCP/IP</a>.
  Originally developed for the US military in 1969, the Internet grew to
  include educational and research institutions and, in the late 1990s,
  millions of businesses, organizations, and individuals. Today the Internet is
  used for email, browsing the <a href="#world_wide_web">World Wide Web</a>,
  instant messaging, usegroups, and many other purposes.</dd>
  
<dt id="internet_protocol_address">Internet protocol
  address (IP address)</dt><dd>The address of a computer on a
  <a href="#transmission_control_protocol_internet_protocol">TCP/IP</a>
  network. Every computer on the Internet has an IP address.
  <a href="#client">Clients</a> have either a permanent IP address or one that
  is dynamically assigned to them each time they connect with the network. IP
  addresses are written as four sets of numbers, like this: 204.171.64.2.</dd>
  
<dt id="java">Java</dt><dd>A programming language developed by Sun
  Microsystems. A single Java program can run on many different kinds of
  computers, thus avoiding the need for programmers to create a separate
  version of each program for each kind of computer. Your browser can
  automatically download and run Java programs (also called applets).</dd>
  
<dt id="javascript">JavaScript</dt><dd>A scripting language commonly
  used to construct web pages. Programmers use JavaScript to make web pages
  more interactive; for example, to display forms and buttons. JavaScript can
  be used with Java, but is technically a separate language. Java is not
  required for JavaScript to work correctly.</dd>
  
<dt id="key">key</dt><dd>A large
  number used by a <a href="#cryptographic_algorithm">cryptographic
  algorithm</a> to encrypt or decrypt data. A person's public key, for example,
  allows other people to encrypt messages to that person. The encrypted
  messages must be decrypted with the corresponding private key. See also
  <a href="#public-key_cryptography">public-key cryptography</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="lightweight_directory_access_protocol">Lightweight Directory Access
  Protocol (LDAP)</dt><dd>A standard protocol for accessing directory
  services, such as corporate address books, across multiple platforms. You can
  set up your browser to access LDAP directories from the Address Book. You can
  also set up Mail &amp; Newsgroups to use an LDAP directory for email address
  autocompletion.</dd>
  
<dt id="location_bar">Location Bar</dt><dd>The field (and associated
  buttons) near the top of a Navigator window where you can type a
  <a href="#uniform_resource_locator">URL</a> or search terms.</dd>
  
<dt id="master_key">master key</dt><dd>

  A symmetric key used by Certificate Manager to encrypt information. For
  example, Password Manager uses Certificate Manager and your master key to
  encrypt email passwords, website passwords, and other stored sensitive
  information. See also <a href="#symmetric_encryption">symmetric
  encryption</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="master_password">master password</dt><dd>A password used by
  Certificate Manager to protect the master key and/or private keys stored on a
  <a href="#security_device">security device</a>. Certificate Manager needs to
  access your private keys, for example, when you sign email messages or use
  one of your own certificates to identify yourself to a website. It needs to
  access your master key when Password Manager or Form Manager reads or adds to
  your personal information. You can set or change your master password from
  the Master Passwords preferences panel. Each security device requires a
  separate master password. See also <a href="#private_key">private key</a>,
  <a href="#master_key">master key</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="misrepresentation">misrepresentation</dt><dd>Presentation of an entity
  as a person or organization that it is not. For example, a website might
  pretend to be a furniture store when it is really just a site that takes
  credit card payments but never sends any goods. See also
  <a href="#spoofing">spoofing</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="navigation_toolbar">Navigation Toolbar</dt><dd>The toolbar
  near the top of the browser window that includes the Back and
  Forward buttons.</dd>
  
<dt id="nonrepudiation">nonrepudiation</dt><dd>
  The inability, of the sender of a message, to deny having sent the message. A
  regular hand-written signature provides one form of nonrepudiation. A
  <a href="#digital_signature">digital signature</a> provides another.</dd>
  
<dt id="object_signing">object signing</dt><dd>A technology that allows
  software developers to sign Java code, JavaScript scripts, or any kind of
  file, and that allows users to identify the signers and control access by
  signed code to local system resources.</dd>
  
<dt id="object-signing_certificate">
  object-signing certificate</dt><dd>A certificate whose corresponding
  private key is used to sign objects such as code files. See also
<a href="#object_signing">object
  signing</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="online_certificate_status_protocol">
  Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)</dt><dd>A set of rules
  that Certificate Manager follows to perform an online check of a
  certificate's validity each time the certificate is used. This process
  involves checking the certificate against a list of valid certificates
  maintained at a specified website. Your computer must be online for OCSP to
  work.</dd>
  
<dt id="p3p">
  P3P</dt><dd>See <a href="#platform_for_privacy_preferences">Platform for
  Privacy Preferences (P3P)</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="password-based_authentication">

  toolbar that appears just below the location bar by default in Navigator . It
  contains standard buttons such as Home, Search, Bookmarks, and so on that you
  can add or remove. You can also add buttons for your favorite bookmarks, or
  folders containing groups of bookmarks.</dd>
  
<dt id="pkcs_11">PKCS #11</dt><dd>
  The public-key cryptography standard that governs security devices such
  as smart cards. See also <a href="#security_device">security device</a>,
  <a href="#smart_card">smart card</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="pkcs_11_module">PKCS
  #11 module</dt><dd>A program on your computer that manages cryptographic
  services such as encryption and decryption using the PKCS #11 standard. Also
  called <i>cryptographic modules</i>, <i>cryptographic service providers,</i>
  or <i>security modules</i>, PKCS #11 modules control either hardware or
  software devices. A PKCS #11 module always controls one or more slots, which
  may be implemented as some form of physical reader (for example, for reading
  smart cards) or in software. Each slot for a PKCS #11 module can in turn
  contain a <a href="#security_device">security device</a> (also called
  <i>token</i>), which is the hardware or software device that provides
  cryptographic services and stores certificates and keys. Certificate Manager
  provides two built-in PKCS #11 modules. You may install additional modules on
  your computer to control smart card readers or other hardware devices.</dd>
  
<dt id="platform_for_privacy_preferences">Platform for Privacy Preferences
  (P3P)</dt><dd>A standard published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
  designed to help users to gain more control over the use of personal
  information by Websites they visit. For general information on the standard
  itself, see the online document <a href="http://www.w3.org/P3P/"
  target="_blank">P3P Public Overview</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="plug-in">plug-in</dt><dd>A type of
  <a href="#helper_application">helper application</a> that adds new
  capabilities to your browser, such as the ability to play audio or video
  clips. Unlike other kinds of helper applications, a plug-in application
  installs itself into the Plugins directory within the main browser
  installation directory and typically can be opened within the browser itself
  (internally). For example, an audio plug-in lets you listen to audio files on
  a web page or in an e-mail message. Macromedia Flash Player and Java are both
  examples of plug-in applications.</dd>
  
<dt id="post_office_protocol">Post Office Protocol (POP)</dt><dd>A standard
  mail server protocol that requires you to download new messages to your local
  computer&mdash;although you can choose to leave copies on the server. With
  POP, you can store all your messages, including sent mail, drafts, and custom
  folders, on one computer only. By contrast,
  <a href="#internet_message_access_protocol">IMAP</a> allows you to
  permanently store all your messages and any changes to them on the server,
  where you can access them from any computer. Most ISPs currently support
  POP.</dd>
  
<dt id="private_key">private key</dt><dd>
  One of a pair of <a href="#key">keys</a> used in public-key cryptography.
  The private key is kept secret and is used to decrypt data that has been
  encrypted with the corresponding public key.</dd>
  
<dt id="proxy">proxy</dt><dd>An intermediary or &quot;go-between&quot;
  program that acts as both a <a href="#server">server</a> and a
  <a href="#client">client</a> for the purpose of making requests on behalf of
  other clients.</dd>
  
<dt id="public_key">public key</dt><dd>
  One of a pair of <a href="#key">keys</a> used in public-key cryptography.
  The public key is distributed freely and published as part of a
  <a href="#certificate">certificate</a>.
  It is typically used to encrypt data sent to the public key's owner, who then
  decrypts the data with the corresponding private key.</dd>
  
<dt id="public-key_cryptography">public-key cryptography</dt><dd>A set of
  well-established techniques and standards that allow an entity (such as a
  person, an organization, or hardware such as a router) to verify its identity
  electronically or to sign and encrypt electronic data. Two keys are involved:
  a <a href="#public_key">public key</a> and a <a href="#private_key">private
  key</a>. The public key is published as part of a
  <a href="#certificate">certificate</a>, which associates that key with a
  particular identity. The corresponding private key is kept secret. Data
  encrypted with the public key can be decrypted only with the private key.
  </dd>
  
<dt id="public-key_infrastructure">public-key infrastructure (PKI)</dt><dd>The
  standards and services that facilitate the use of public-key cryptography and
  certificates in a networked environment.</dd>
  
<dt id="root_ca">root CA</dt><dd>
  The <a href="#certificate_authority">certificate authority (CA)</a> with
  a self-signed certificate at the top of a
  <a href="#certificate_chain">certificate chain</a>. See also
  <a href="#subordinate_ca">subordinate CA</a>.</dd>
  
<dt id="search_engine">search engine</dt><dd>A web-based program
  that allows users to search for and retrieve specific information from the
  World Wide Web. The search engine may search the full text of web documents
  or a list of keywords, or use librarians who review web documents and index
  them manually for retrieval. Typically, the user types a word or phrase, also
  called a query, into a search box, and the search engine displays links to
  relevant web pages.</dd>
  
<dt id="secure_sockets_layer">Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</dt><dd>A protocol
  that allows mutual authentication between a <a href="#client">client</a> and
  a <a href="#server">server</a> for the purpose of establishing an
  authenticated and encrypted connection. SSL runs above TCP/IP and below HTTP,
  LDAP, IMAP, NNTP, and other high-level network protocols. The new Internet
  Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard called Transport Layer Security (TLS)
