<h1 id="glossary">Glossary</h1>

<dl>

<dt id="authentication">authentication</dt><dd>The use of a password,
  certificate, personal identification number (PIN), or other information to
  validate an identity over a computer network. See also
  <a href="#password-based_authentication">password-based authentication</a>,
  <a href="#certificate-based_authentication">certificate-based
  authentication</a>, <a href="#client_authentication">client
  authentication</a>, <a href="#server_authentication">server
  authentication</a>.</dd>

<dt id="bookmark">bookmark</dt><dd>A stored <a href="#web_page">web page</a>
  address (<a href="#url">URL</a>) that you can go to easily by clicking a
  bookmark icon in the <a href="personal_toolbar">Personal Toolbar</a> or
  choosing the bookmark&apos;s name from the Bookmarks menu.</dd>

<dt id="ca">CA</dt><dd>See <a href="#certificate_authority">certificate
  authority (CA)</a></dd>

<dt id="ca_certificate">CA certificate</dt><dd>A certificate that
  identifies a certificate authority. See also
  <a href="#certificate_authority">certificate authority (CA)</a>,
  <a href="#subordinate_ca">subordinate CA</a>, <a href="#root_ca">root
  CA</a>.</dd>

<dt id="cache">cache</dt><dd>A collection of web page copies stored
  on your computer&apos;s hard disk or in its random-access memory (RAM). The
  browser accumulates these copies as you browse the Web. When you click a link
  or type a <a href="#url">URL</a> to fetch a particular web page for which the
  cache already contains a copy, the browser compares the cached copy to the
  original. If there have been no changes, the browser uses the cached copy
  rather than refetching the original, saving processing and download
  time.</dd>

<dt id="certificate">certificate</dt><dd>The digital equivalent of an ID card.
  A certificate specifies the name of an individual, company, or other entity
  and certifies that a public key, which is included in the certificate,
  belongs to that entity. When you digitally sign a message or other data, the
  digital signature for that message is created with the aid of the private key
  that corresponds to the public key in your certificate. A certificate is
  issued and digitally signed by a <a href="#certificate_authority">certificate
  authority (CA)</a>. A certificate&apos;s validity can be verified by checking
  the CA&apos;s <a href="#digital_signature">digital signature</a>. Also called
  digital ID, digital passport, public-key certificate, X.509 certificate, and
  security certificate. See also <a href="#public-key_cryptography">public-key
  cryptography</a>.</dd>

<dt id="certificate_authority">certificate authority (CA)</dt><dd>A service
  that issues a certificate after verifying the identity of the person or
  entity the certificate is intended to identify. A CA also renews and revokes
  certificates and generates a list of revoked certificates at regular
  intervals. CAs can be independent vendors or a person or organization using
  certificate-issuing server software (such as &brandShortName; Certificate
  Management System). See also <a href="#certificate">certificate</a>,
  <a href="#crl">CRL (certificate revocation list)</a>.</dd>

<dt id="certificate_backup_password">certificate backup password</dt><dd>A
  password that protects a certificate that you are backing up or have
  previously backed up. Certificate Manager asks you to set this password when
  you back up a certificate, and requests it when you attempt to restore a
  certificate that has previously been backed up.</dd>

<dt id="certificate-based_authentication">certificate-based
  authentication</dt><dd>Verification of identity based on certificates and
  public-key cryptography. See also
  <a href="#password-based_authentication">password-based
  authentication</a>.</dd>

<dt id="certificate_chain">certificate chain</dt><dd>A hierarchical series of
  certificates signed by successive certificate authorities. A CA certificate
  identifies a <a href="#certificate_authority">certificate authority (CA)</a>
  and is used to sign certificates issued by that authority. A CA certificate
  can in turn be signed by the CA certificate of a parent CA and so on up to a
  <a href="#root_ca">root CA</a>.</dd>

<dt id="certificate_fingerprint">certificate fingerprint</dt><dd>
  A unique number associated with a certificate. The number is not part of
  the certificate itself but is produced by applying a mathematical function to
  the contents of the certificate. If the contents of the certificate change,
  even by a single character, the function produces a different number.
  Certificate fingerprints can therefore be used to verify that certificates
  have not been tampered with.</dd>

<dt id="certificate_manager">Certificate
  Manager</dt><dd>The part of the browser that allows you to view and manage
  certificates. To view the main Certificate Manager window: Open the
  <span class="mac">&brandShortName;</span> <span class="noMac">Edit</span>
  menu, choose Preferences, click Privacy and Security, and then click Manage
  Certificates.</dd>

<dt id="certificate_renewal">certificate renewal</dt><dd>The process of
  renewing a <a href="#certificate">certificate</a> that is about to
  expire.</dd>

<dt id="certificate_verification">certificate verification</dt><dd>When
  <a href="#certificate_manager">Certificate Manager</a> verifies a
  certificate, it confirms that the digital signature was created by a CA whose
  own CA certificate is both on file with Certificate Manager and marked as
  trusted for issuing that kind of certificate. It also confirms that the
  certificate being verified has not itself been marked as untrusted. Finally,
  if the <a href="#ocsp">OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)</a> has been
  activated, Certificate Manager also performs an online check. It does so by
  looking up the certificate in a list of valid certificates maintained at a
  <a href="#url">URL</a> that is specified either in the certificate itself or
  in the browser&apos;s Validation preferences. If any of these checks fail,
  Certificate Manager marks the certificate as unverified and won&apos;t
  recognize the identity it certifies.</dd>

<dt id="cipher">cipher</dt><dd>See
  <a href="#cryptographic_algorithm">cryptographic algorithm</a>.</dd>

<dt id="client">client</dt><dd>Software (such as browser software) that sends
  requests to and receives information from a <a href="#server">server</a>,
  which is usually running on a different computer. A computer on which client
  software runs is also described as a client.</dd>

<dt id="client_authentication">client authentication</dt><dd>The process of
  identifying a <a href="#client">client</a> to a <a href="#server">server</a>,
  for example with a name and password or with a
  <a href="#client_ssl_certificate">client SSL certificate</a> and some
  digitally signed data. See also <a href="#ssl">SSL (Secure
  Sockets Layer)</a>, <a href="#server_authentication">server
  authentication</a>.</dd>

<dt id="client_ssl_certificate">client SSL certificate</dt><dd>A certificate
  that a <a href="#client">client</a> (such as browser software) presents to a
  <a href="#server">server</a> to authenticate the identity of the client
  (or the identity of the person using the client) using the
  <a href="#ssl">SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)</a> protocol. See
  also <a href="#client_authentication">client authentication</a>.</dd>

<dt id="component_bar">Component Bar</dt><dd>The toolbar located at the bottom
  left of any &brandShortName; window. The Component Bar allows you to switch
  between &brandShortName; components by clicking icons for Navigator,
  Mail &amp; Newsgroups, Composer, and so on.</dd>

<dt id="cookie">cookie</dt><dd>A small bit of information stored on your
  computer by some <a href="#web_site">websites</a>. When you visit such a
  site, the site asks your browser to place one or more cookies on your hard
  disk. Later, when you return to the site, your browser sends the site the
  cookies that belong to it. Cookies help websites keep track of information
  about you, such as the contents of your shopping cart. You can set your
  cookie preferences to control how cookies are used and how much information
  you are willing to let websites store on them. See also
  <a href="#foreign_cookie">foreign cookie</a>.</dd>

<dt id="cookie_manager">Cookie Manager</dt><dd>The part of the browser
  that you can use to control <a href="#cookie">cookies</a>.</dd>

<dt id="crl">CRL (certificate revocation list)</dt><dd>A list of revoked
  certificates that is generated and signed by a
  <a href="#certificate_authority">certificate authority (CA)</a>. You can
  download the latest CRL to your browser or to a server, then check against it
  to make sure that certificates are still valid before permitting their use
  for authentication.</dd>

<dt id="cryptographic_algorithm">cryptographic algorithm</dt><dd>A set of
  rules or directions used to perform cryptographic operations such as
  <a href="#encryption">encryption</a> and
  <a href="#decryption">decryption</a>. Sometimes called a
  <em>cipher.</em></dd>

<dt id="cryptography">cryptography</dt><dd>The art and practice of scrambling
  (encrypting) and unscrambling (decrypting) information. For example,
  cryptographic techniques are used to scramble an unscramble information
  flowing between commercial websites and your browser. See also
  <a href="#public-key_cryptography">public-key cryptography</a>.</dd>

<dt id="decryption">decryption</dt><dd>The process of unscrambling data that
  has been encrypted. See also <a href="#encryption">encryption</a>.</dd>

<dt id="digital_id">digital ID</dt><dd>
  See <a href="#certificate">certificate</a>.</dd>

<dt id="digital_signature">digital signature</dt><dd>A code created from both
  the data to be signed and the private key of the signer. This code is unique
  for each new piece of data. Even a single comma added to a message changes
  the digital signature for that message. Successful validation of your digital
  signature by appropriate software not only provides evidence that you
  approved the transaction or message, but also provides evidence that the data
  has not changed since you digitally signed it. A digital signature has
  nothing to do with a handwritten signature, although it can sometimes be used
  for similar legal purposes. See also
  <a href="#nonrepudiation">nonrepudiation</a>,
  <a href="#tamper_detection">tamper detection</a>.</dd>

<dt id="distinguished_name">distinguished name (DN)</dt><dd>A specially
  formatted name that uniquely identifies the subject of a
  <a href="#certificate">certificate</a>.</dd>

<dt id="dual_key_pairs">dual key pairs</dt><dd>Two public-private key
  pairs&mdash;four keys altogether&mdash;corresponding to two separate
  certificates. The private key of one pair is used for signing operations, and
  the public and private keys of the other pair are used for encryption and
  decryption operations. Each pair corresponds to a separate
  <a href="#certificate">certificate</a>. See also
  <a href="#public-key_cryptography">public-key cryptography</a>.</dd>

<dt id="eavesdropping">eavesdropping</dt><dd>Surreptitious interception of
  information sent over a network by an entity for which the information is not
  intended.</dd>

<dt id="encryption">encryption</dt><dd>The process of scrambling information in
  a way that disguises its meaning. For example, encrypted connections between
  computers make it very difficult for third-parties to unscramble, or
  <em>decrypt,</em> information flowing over the connection. Encrypted
  information can be decrypted only by someone who possesses the appropriate
  key. See also <a href="#public-key_cryptography">public-key
  cryptography</a>.</dd>

<dt id="encryption_certificate">encryption certificate</dt><dd>A
  <a href="#certificate">certificate</a> whose public key is used for
  encryption only. Encryption certificates are not used for signing operations.
  See also <a href="#dual_key_pairs">dual key pairs</a>,
  <a href="#signing_certificate">signing certificate</a>.</dd>

<dt id="encryption_key">encryption key</dt><dd>A private key used for
  encryption only. An encryption key and its equivalent private key, plus a
  <a href="#signing_key">signing key</a> and its equivalent public key,
  constitute a <a href="#dual_key_pairs">dual key pairs</a>.</dd>

<dt id="fingerprint">fingerprint</dt><dd>See
  <a href="#certificate_fingerprint">certificate fingerprint</a>.</dd>

  Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) 140-1 is a US government standard for
  implementations of cryptographic modules&mdash;that is, hardware or software
  that encrypts and decrypts data or performs other cryptographic operations
  (such as creating or verifying digital signatures). Many products sold to the
  US government must comply with one or more of the FIPS standards.</dd>

<dt id="foreign_cookie">foreign cookie</dt><dd>A <a href="#cookie">cookie</a>
  from one site that gets stored on your computer when you visit a different
  site. Sometimes a <a href="#web_site">website</a> displays content that is
  hosted on another website.That content can be anything from an image to text
  or an advertisement. The second website that hosts such elements also has the
  ability to store a cookie in your browser, even though you don&apos;t visit
  it directly. Also known as <q>third-party cookie</q>.</dd>

<dt id="form_manager">Form Manager</dt><dd>The part of the browser that can
  help you save the personal data you enter into online forms, such as your
  name, address, phone, and so on. Then, when a website presents you with a
  form, Form Manager can fill it in automatically.</dd>

<dt id="frame">frame</dt><dd>Frames are <a href="#web_page">web pages</a>
  contained inside of an all-encompasssing <q>meta</q> page.</dd>

<dt id="ftp">FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</dt><dd>A
  standard that allows users to transfer files from one computer to another
  over a network. You can use your browser to fetch files using FTP.</dd>

<dt id="gopher">Gopher</dt><dd>A protocol used to search and retrieve
  information on Internet <a href="#server">servers</a>, common before the
  emergence of the <a href="#world_wide_web">World Wide Web</a>.</dd>

<dt id="helper_application">helper application</dt><dd>Any application that is
  used to open or view a file downloaded by the browser. A
  <a href="#plug-in">plug-in</a> is a special kind of helper application that
  installs itself into the Plugins directory of the main browser installation
  directory and can typically be opened within the browser itself (internally).
  Microsoft Word, Adobe Photoshop, and other external applications are
  considered helper applications but not plug-ins, since they don&apos;t
  install themselves into the browser directory, but can be opened from the
  download dialog box.</dd>

<dt id="home_page">home page</dt><dd>The page your browser is set to display
  every time you launch it or when you click the Home button. Also used to
  refer to the main page for a website, from which you can explore the rest of
  the site.</dd>

<dt id="html">HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</dt><dd>The document format used
  for web pages. The HTML standard defines tags, or codes, used to define the
  text layout, fonts, style, images, and other elements that make up a web
  page.</dd>

<dt id="https">HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)</dt><dd>The secure
  version of the HTTP protocol that uses <a href="#ssl">SSL</a> to ensure the
  privacy of customer data (such as credit card information) while en route
  over the <a href="#internet">Internet</a>.</dd>

<dt id="imap">IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)</dt><dd>A standard mail
  server protocol that allows you to store all your messages and any changes to
  them on the server rather than on your computer&apos;s hard disk. Using IMAP
  rather than <a href="#pop">POP</a> saves disk space and allows you to access
  your entire mailbox, including sent mail, drafts, and custom folders, from
  any location. Using an IMAP server over a modem is generally faster than
  using a POP mail server, since you initially download message headers only.
  Not all <a href="#isp">ISPs</a> support IMAP.</dd>

<dt id="implicit_consent">implicit consent</dt><dd>Also known as implied or
  <q>opt-out</q> consent. Used to describe privacy settings that may allow
  websites to gather information about you (for example by means of
  <a href="#cookie">cookies</a> and online forms) unless you explicitly choose
  to withhold your consent by selecting an option on a page that the website
  provides for that purpose. Your consent may not be requested when the
  information is actually gathered.</dd>

<dt id="internet">Internet</dt><dd>A worldwide network of millions of computers
  that communicate with each other using standard protocols such as
  <a href="#tcp_ip">TCP/IP</a>. Originally developed for the US military in
  1969, the Internet grew to include educational and research institutions and,
  in the late 1990s, millions of businesses, organizations, and individuals.
  Today the Internet is used for email, browsing the
  <a href="#world_wide_web">World Wide Web (WWW)</a>, instant messaging,
  usegroups, and many other purposes.</dd>

<dt id="ip_address">IP address (Internet protocol address)</dt><dd>The address
  of a computer on a <a href="#tcp_ip">TCP/IP</a> network. Every computer on
  the <a href="#internet">Internet</a> has an IP address.
  <a href="#client">Clients</a> have either a permanent IP address or one that
  is dynamically assigned to them each time they connect with the network. IP
  addresses are written as four sets of numbers, like this: 204.171.64.2.</dd>

<dt id="irc">IRC (Internet Relay Chat)</dt><dd>A protocol used to chat with
  other people in real-time using an IRC <a href="#client">client</a>.</dd>

<dt id="isp">ISP (Internet Service Provider)</dt><dd>A company/institution
  that provides <a href="#internet">Internet</a> connections.</dd>

<dt id="java">Java</dt><dd>A programming language developed by Sun
  Microsystems. A single Java program can run on many different kinds of
  computers, thus avoiding the need for programmers to create a separate
  version of each program for each kind of computer. Your browser can
  automatically download and run Java programs (also called applets).</dd>

<dt id="javascript">JavaScript</dt><dd>A scripting language commonly used to
  construct <a href="#web_page">web pages</a>. Programmers use JavaScript to
  make web pages more interactive; for example, to display forms and buttons.
  JavaScript can be used with <a href="#java">Java</a>, but is technically a
  separate language. Java is not required for JavaScript to work
  correctly.</dd>

<dt id="key">key</dt><dd>A large number used by a
  <a href="#cryptographic_algorithm">cryptographic algorithm</a> to encrypt or
  decrypt data. A person&apos;s public key, for example, allows other people to
  encrypt messages to that person. The encrypted messages must be decrypted
  with the corresponding private key. See also
  <a href="#public-key_cryptography">public-key cryptography</a>.</dd>

<dt id="ldap">LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)</dt><dd>A standard
  protocol for accessing directory services, such as corporate address books,
  across multiple platforms. You can set up your browser to access LDAP
  directories from the Address Book. You can also set up Mail &amp; Newsgroups
  to use an LDAP directory for email address autocompletion.</dd>

<dt id="location_bar">Location Bar</dt><dd>The field (and associated buttons)
  near the top of a Navigator window where you can type a
  <a href="#url">URL</a> or search terms.</dd>

<dt id="master_key">master key</dt><dd>A symmetric key used by
  <a href="#certificate_manager">Certificate Manager</a> to encrypt
  information. For example, <a href="password_manager">Password Manager</a>
  uses Certificate Manager and your master key to encrypt email passwords,
  website passwords, and other stored sensitive information. See also
  <a href="#symmetric_encryption">symmetric encryption</a>.</dd>

<dt id="master_password">master password</dt><dd>A password used by
  Certificate Manager to protect the master key and/or private keys stored on a
  <a href="#security_device">security device</a>. Certificate Manager needs to
  access your private keys, for example, when you sign email messages or use
  one of your own certificates to identify yourself to a website. It needs to
  access your master key when Password Manager or Form Manager reads or adds to
  your personal information. You can set or change your master password from
  the Master Passwords preferences panel. Each security device requires a
  separate master password. See also <a href="#private_key">private key</a>,
  <a href="#master_key">master key</a>.</dd>

<dt id="misrepresentation">misrepresentation</dt><dd>Presentation of an entity
  as a person or organization that it is not. For example, a website might
  pretend to be a furniture store when it is really just a site that takes
  credit card payments but never sends any goods. See also
  <a href="#spoofing">spoofing</a>.</dd>

<dt id="navigation_toolbar">Navigation Toolbar</dt><dd>The toolbar near the top
  of the browser window that includes the Back and Forward buttons.</dd>

<dt id="nonrepudiation">nonrepudiation</dt><dd>The inability, of the sender of
  a message, to deny having sent the message. A regular hand-written signature
  provides one form of nonrepudiation. A
  <a href="#digital_signature">digital signature</a> provides another.</dd>

<dt id="object_signing">object signing</dt><dd>A technology that allows
  software developers to sign Java code, JavaScript scripts, or any kind of
  file, and that allows users to identify the signers and control access by
  signed code to local system resources.</dd>

<dt id="object-signing_certificate">object-signing certificate</dt><dd>A
  certificate whose corresponding private key is used to sign objects such as
  code files. See also <a href="#object_signing">object signing</a>.</dd>

<dt id="ocsp">OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)</dt><dd>A set of rules
  that <a href="#certificate_manager">Certificate Manager</a> follows to
  perform an online check of a certificate&apos;s validity each time the
  certificate is used. This process involves checking the certificate against a
  list of valid certificates maintained at a specified website. Your computer
  must be online for OCSP to work.</dd>

<dt id="p3p">P3P (Platform for Privacy Preferences)</dt><dd>A standard
  published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) designed to help users to
  gain more control over the use of personal information by websites they

<dt id="password-based_authentication">password-based
  authentication</dt><dd>Confident identification by means of a name and
  password. See also <a href="#authentication">authentication</a>.</dd>

<dt id="password_manager">Password Manager</dt><dd>The part of the
  browser that can help you remember some or all of your names and passwords by
  storing them on your computer&apos;s hard disk, and entering them for you
  automatically when you visit such sites.</dd>

<dt id="personal_toolbar">Personal Toolbar</dt><dd>The customizable toolbar
  that appears just below the location bar by default in Navigator. It contains
  standard buttons such as Home, Search, Bookmarks, and so on that you can add
  or remove. You can also add buttons for your favorite bookmarks, or folders
  containing groups of bookmarks.</dd>

<dt id="pkcs_11">PKCS #11</dt><dd>The public-key cryptography standard that
  governs security devices such as smart cards. See also
  <a href="#security_device">security device</a>, <a href="#smart_card">smart
  card</a>.</dd>

<dt id="pkcs_11_module">PKCS #11 module</dt><dd>A program on your computer
  that manages cryptographic services such as encryption and decryption using
  the PKCS #11 standard. Also called <em>cryptographic modules</em>,
  <em>cryptographic service providers,</em> or <em>security modules</em>,
  PKCS #11 modules control either hardware or software devices. A PKCS #11
  module always controls one or more slots, which may be implemented as some
  form of physical reader (for example, for reading smart cards) or in
  software. Each slot for a PKCS #11 module can in turn contain a
  <a href="#security_device">security device</a> (also called <em>token</em>),
  which is the hardware or software device that provides cryptographic services
  and stores certificates and keys. <a href="certificate_manager">Certificate
  Manager</a> provides two built-in PKCS #11 modules. You may install
  additional modules on your computer to control smart card readers or other
  hardware devices.</dd>

<dt id="pki">PKI (public-key infrastructure)</dt><dd>The standards and services
  that facilitate the use of public-key cryptography and certificates in a
  networked environment.</dd>

<dt id="plug-in">plug-in</dt><dd>A type of
  <a href="#helper_application">helper application</a> that adds new
  capabilities to your browser, such as the ability to play audio or video
  clips. Unlike other kinds of helper applications, a plug-in application
  installs itself into the Plugins directory within the main browser
  installation directory and typically can be opened within the browser itself
  (internally). For example, an audio plug-in lets you listen to audio files on
  a <a href="#web_page">web page</a> or in an e-mail message. Macromedia Flash
  Player and Java are both examples of plug-in applications.</dd>

<dt id="pop">POP (Post Office Protocol)</dt><dd>A standard mail server protocol
  that requires you to download new messages to your local
  computer&mdash;although you can choose to leave copies on the server. With
  POP, you can store all your messages, including sent mail, drafts, and custom
  folders, on one computer only. By contrast,
  <a href="#imap">IMAP</a> allows you to permanently store all your messages
  and any changes to them on the server, where you can access them from any
  computer. Most <a href="#isp">ISPs</a> currently support POP.</dd>

<dt id="private_key">private key</dt><dd>One of a pair of
  <a href="#key">keys</a> used in public-key cryptography. The private key is
  kept secret and is used to decrypt data that has been encrypted with the
  corresponding public key.</dd>

<dt id="proxy">proxy</dt><dd>An intermediary or <q>go-between</q> program that
  acts as both a <a href="#server">server</a> and a
  <a href="#client">client</a> for the purpose of making requests on behalf of
  other clients.</dd>

<dt id="public_key">public key</dt><dd>
  One of a pair of <a href="#key">keys</a> used in public-key cryptography.
  The public key is distributed freely and published as part of a
  <a href="#certificate">certificate</a>. It is typically used to encrypt data
  sent to the public key&apos;s owner, who then decrypts the data with the
  corresponding private key.</dd>

<dt id="public-key_cryptography">public-key cryptography</dt><dd>A set of
  well-established techniques and standards that allow an entity (such as a
  person, an organization, or hardware such as a router) to verify its identity
  electronically or to sign and encrypt electronic data. Two keys are involved:
  a <a href="#public_key">public key</a> and a <a href="#private_key">private
  key</a>. The public key is published as part of a
  <a href="#certificate">certificate</a>, which associates that key with a
  particular identity. The corresponding private key is kept secret. Data
  encrypted with the public key can be decrypted only with the private key.
  </dd>

<dt id="roaming_profile">roaming profile</dt><dd>A user profile (or parts of
  it) stored on a remote <a href="#server">server</a> and used for sharing the
  same settings and data across multiple computers.</dd>

<dt id="root_ca">root CA</dt><dd>The
  <a href="#certificate_authority">certificate authority (CA)</a> with a
  self-signed certificate at the top of a
  <a href="#certificate_chain">certificate chain</a>. See also

<dt id="search_engine">search engine</dt><dd>A web-based program that allows
  users to search for and retrieve specific information from the
  <a href="#world_wide_web">World Wide Web (WWW)</a>. The search engine may
  search the full text of web documents or a list of keywords, or use
  librarians who review web documents and index them manually for retrieval.
  Typically, the user types a word or phrase, also called a query, into a
  search box, and the search engine displays links to relevant web pages.</dd>

<dt id="security_certificate">security certificate</dt><dd>See
  <a href="#certificate">certificate</a>.</dd>
