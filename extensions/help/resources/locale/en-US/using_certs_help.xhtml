<h1 id="using_certificates">Using Certificates</h1>

<p>A certificate is the digital equivalent of an ID card. Just as you may have
  several ID cards for different purposes, such as a driver&apos;s license, an
  employee ID card, or a credit card, you can have several different
  certificates that identify you for different purposes.</p>

<p>This section describes how to perform operations related to
  certificates.</p>

<h1 id="getting_your_own_certificate">Getting Your Own Certificate</h1>

<p>Much like a credit card or a driver&apos;s license, a certificate is a form
  of identification you can use to identify yourself over the Internet and
  other networks. Like other commonly used personal IDs, a certificate is
  typically issued by an organization with recognized authority to issue such
  identification. An organization that issues certificates is called a
  <strong>certificate authority (CA).</strong></p>

<p>You can obtain certificates that identify you from public CAs, from system
  administrators or special CAs within your organization, or from websites
  offering specialized services that require a means of identification more
  reliable that your name and password.</p>

<p>Just as the requirements for a driver&apos;s license vary depending on the
  type of vehicle you want to drive, the requirements for obtaining a
  certificate vary depending on what you want to use it for. In some cases
  getting a certificate may be as easy as going to a website, entering some
  personal information, and automatically downloading the certificate into your
  browser. In other cases you may have to go through more complicated
  procedures.</p>

<p>You can obtain a certificate today by visiting the URL for a certificate
  authority and following the on-screen instructions. For a list of certificate
  authorities, see the online document
  <a href="https://certs.netscape.com/" target="_blank">Client
  Certificates</a>.</p>

<p>Once you obtain a certificate, it is automatically stored in a
  <a href="glossary.xhtml#security_device">security device</a>. Your browser
  comes with its own built-in Software Security Device. A security device can
  also be a piece of hardware, such as a smart card.</p>

<p>Like a driver&apos;s license or a credit card, a certificate is a valuable
  form of identification that can be abused if it falls into the wrong hands.
  Once you&apos;ve obtained a certificate that identifies you, you should
  protect it in two ways: by backing it up and by setting your
  <a href="glossary.xhtml#master_password">master password</a>.</p>

<p>When you first obtain a certificate, you may be prompted to back it up. If
  you haven&apos;t yet created a master password, you will be asked to create
  one.</p>

<p>For detailed information about backing up a certificate and setting your
  master password, see <a href="certs_help.xhtml#your_certificates">Your
  Certificates</a>.</p>

<h1 id="checking_security_for_a_web_page">Checking Security for a Web Page</h1>

<p>When you&apos;re viewing any web page, the lock icon near the lower-right
  corner of the window informs you whether the entire contents of the page was
  protected by <a href="glossary.xhtml#encryption">encryption</a> while it was
  being received by your computer:</p>

<table summary="lock icons">
  <tr>
    <td><img alt="closed lock icon"
      src="chrome://communicator/skin/icons/lock-secure.gif"></img></td>
    <td>A closed lock means that the page was protected by encryption when it
      was received.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img alt="open lock icon"
      src="chrome://communicator/skin/icons/lock-insecure.gif"></img></td>
    <td>An open lock means the page was not protected by encryption when it was
      received.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img alt="broken lock icon"
      src="chrome://communicator/skin/icons/lock-broken.gif"></img></td>
    <td>A broken lock means that some or all of the elements within the page
      were not protected by encryption when the page was received, even though
      the outermost HTML page was encrypted.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>For more details about the encryption status of the page when it was
  received, click the lock icon (or open the View menu, choose Page Info, and
  click the Security tab).</p>

<p>The Security tab for Page Info provides two kinds of information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The top half describes whether the website displaying the page has been
    verified. (For information on certificate verification, see
    <a href="#controlling_validation">Controlling Validation</a>.)</li>
  <li>The bottom half describes whether the contents of the page you are
    viewing is protected by encryption while in transit over the network.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> The lock icon describes only the encryption
  status of the page while it was being received by your computer. To be
  notified before you send or receive information without encryption, select
  the appropriate SSL warning options. See <a href="ssl_help.xhtml">Privacy
  &amp; Security Preferences - SSL</a> for details.</p>

<h1 id="managing_certificates">Managing Certificates</h1>

<p>You can use the Certificate Manager to manage the certificates you have
  available. Certificates may be stored on your computer&apos;s hard disk or on
  <a href="glossary.xhtml#smart_card">smart cards</a> or other security devices
  attached to your computer.</p>

<p>To open the Certificate Manager:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <span class="mac">&brandShortName;</span>
    <span class="noMac">Edit</span> menu and choose Preferences.</li>
  <li>Under the Privacy &amp; Security category, click Certificates. (If no
    subcategories are visible, double-click Privacy &amp; Security to expand

<h2 id="managing_certificates_that_identify_you">Managing Certificates that
Identify You</h2>

<p>When you first open the Certificate Manager, you&apos;ll notice that it has
  several tabs across the top of its window. The first tab is called Your
  Certificates, and it displays the certificates your browser has available
  that identify you. Your certificates are listed under the names of the
  organizations that issued them.</p>

<p>To perform an action on one or more certificates, click the entry for the
  certificate (or Control-click to select more than one), then click the View,
  Backup, or Delete button. Each of these buttons brings up another window that
  allows you to perform the action. Click the Help button in any window to
  obtain more information about using that window.</p>

<p>The following buttons under Your Certificates don&apos;t require a
  certificate to be selected. You use them to perform these actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Import.</strong> Click this button if you want to import a
    certificate that you&apos;ve previously backed up or transferred from one
    machine to another.</li>
  <li><strong>Backup All.</strong> Click this button to back up all your own
    certificates stored in the
    <a href="glossary.xhtml#software_security_device">Software Security
    Device</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Certificates on smart cards cannot be backed up.</strong> Whether
  you select some of your certificates and click Backup, or click Backup All,
  the resulting backup file will not include any certificates stored on smart
  cards or other external security devices. You can only back up certificates
  that are stored on the built-in Software Security Device.</p>

<p>For more details about any of these tasks, see
  <a href="certs_help.xhtml#your_certificates">Your Certificates</a>.</p>

<p>[<a href="#managing_certificates">Return to beginning of

<h2 id="managing_certificates_that_identify_others">Managing Certificates that
  Identify Others</h2>

<p>When you compose a mail message, you can choose to attach your digital
  signature to it. A <a href="glossary.xhtml#digital_signature">digital
  signature</a> allows recipients of the message to verify that the message
  really comes from you and hasn&apos;t been tampered with since you sent
  it.</p>

<p>Every time you send a digitally signed message, your encryption certificate
  is automatically included with the message. This certificate allows the
  message recipients to send you encrypted messages.</p>

<p>One of the easiest ways to obtain someone else&apos;s encryption certificate
  is for that person to send you a digitally signed message. Certificate
  Manager automatically stores other people&apos;s certificates whenever they
  are received in this way.</p>

<p>To view all the certificates identifying other people that are available to
  the Certificate Manager, click the Other People&apos;s tab at the top of the
  Certificate Manager window. You can send encrypted messages to anyone for
  whom a valid certificate is listed. Certificates are listed under the names
  of the organizations that issued them.</p>

<p>To perform an action on one or more certificates, click the entry for the
  certificate (or Control-click to select more than one), then click the View
  or Delete button. Each of these buttons brings up another window that allows
  you to perform the action. Click the Help button in any window to obtain more

<h2 id="managing_certificates_that_identify_websites">Managing Certificates
  that Identify Websites</h2>

<p>Some websites use certificates to identify themselves. Such identification
  is required before the website can encrypt information transferred between
  the site and your computer (or vice versa), so that no one can read the data
  while in transit.</p>

<p>If the URL for a website begins with <tt>https://</tt>, the website has a
  certificate. If you visit such a website and its certificate was issued by a
  CA that the Certificate Manager doesn&apos;t know about or doesn&apos;t
  trust, you will be asked whether you want to accept the website&apos;s
  certificate. When you accept a new website certificate, the Certificate
  Manager adds it to its list of website certificates.</p>

<p>To view all the website certificates available to your browser, click the
  Websites tab at the top of the Certificate Manager window.</p>

<p>To perform an action on one or more website certificates, click the entry
for the certificate (or Shift-click to select more than one), then click the
View, Edit, or Delete button. Each of these buttons brings up another window
that allows you to perform the corresponding action.</p>

<p>The Edit button allows you to specify whether your browser will trust the
selected website certificates in the future.</p>

<h2 id="managing_certificates_that_identify_certificate_authorities">Managing
  Certificates that Identify Certificate Authorities</h2>

<p>Like other commonly used forms of ID, a certificate is issued by an
  organization with recognized authority to issue such identification. An
  organization that issues certificates is called a
  <a href="glossary.xhtml#certificate_authority">certificate authority
  (CA)</a>. A certificate that identifies a CA is called a CA certificate.</p>

<p>Certificate Manager typically has many CA certificates on file. These CA
  certificates permit Certificate Manager to recognize and work with
  certificates issued by the corresponding CAs. However, the presence of a CA
  certificate in this list does <em>not</em> guarantee that the certificates it
  issues can be trusted. You or your system administrator must make decisions
  about what kinds of certificates to trust depending on your security
  needs.</p>

<p>To view all the CA certificates available to your browser, click the
  Authorities tab at the top of the Certificate Manager window.</p>

<p>To perform an action on one or more CA certificates, click the entry for the
  certificate (or Control-click to select more than one), then click the View,
  Edit, or Delete button. Each of these buttons brings up another window that
  allows you to perform the action. Click the Help button in any window to
  obtain more information about using that window.</p>

<p>The Edit button allows you to view and control the trust settings for each
  certificate. Trust settings for a CA certificate let you to specify which
  kinds of certificates issued by that CA you are willing to trust.</p>

<h1 id="managing_smart_cards_and_other_security_devices">Managing Smart Cards
  and Other Security Devices</h1>

<p>A smart card is a small device, typically about the size of a credit card,
  that contains a microprocessor and is capable of storing information about
  your identity (such as your <a href="glossary.xhtml#private_key">private
  keys</a> and <a href="glossary.xhtml#certificate">certificates</a>) and
  performing cryptographic operations.</p>

<p>To use a smart card, you typically need to have a smart card reader (a piece
  of hardware) attached to your computer, as well as software on your computer
  that controls the reader.</p>

<p>A smart card is just one kind of security device. A security device
  (sometimes called a token) is a hardware or software device that provides
  cryptographic services and stores information about your identity. Use the
  Device Manager to work with smart cards and other security devices.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<h2 id="about_security_devices_and_modules">About Security Devices and
  Modules</h2>

<p>The Device Manager displays a window that lists the available security
  devices. You can use the Device Manager to manage any security devices,
  including smart cards, that support the Public Key Cryptography Standard
  (PKCS) #11.</p>

<p>A <a href="glossary.xhtml#pkcs_11_module">PKCS #11 module</a> (sometimes
  called a security module) controls one or more security devices in much the
  same way that a software driver controls an external device such as a printer
  or modem. If you are installing a smart card, you must install the PKCS #11
  module for the smart card on your computer as well as connecting the smart
  card reader.</p>

<p>By default, the Device Manager controls two internal PKCS #11 modules that
  manage three security devices:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>&brandShortName; Internal PKCS #11 Module:</strong> Controls two
    security devices:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Generic Crypto Services:</strong> A special security device
        that performs all cryptographic operations required by the
	&brandShortName; Internal PKCS #11 Module.</li>
      <li><strong>Software Security Device:L</strong> Stores your certificates
        and keys that aren&apos;t stored on external security devices,
	including any CA certificates that you may have installed in addition
	to those that come with the browser.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Builtin Roots Module:</strong> Controls a special security device
    called the Builtin Object Token. This security device stores the default
    <a href="glossary.xhtml#ca_certificate">CA certificates</a> that come with
    the browser.</li>
</ul>

<p>[<a href="#managing_smart_cards_and_other_security_devices">Return to
  beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="using_security_devices">Using Security Devices</h2>

<p>The Device Manager allows you to perform operations on security devices. To
  open the Device Manager, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <span class="mac">&brandShortName;</span>
    <span class="noMac">Edit</span> menu and choose Preferences.</li>
  <li>Under the Privacy &amp; Security category, click Certificates. (If no
    subcategories are visible, double-click Privacy &amp; Security to expand
    the list.)</li>
  <li>In the Certificates panel, click Manage Security Devices.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Device Manager lists each available PKCS #11 module in boldface, and the
  security devices managed by each module below its name.</p>

<p>When you select a security device, information about it appears in the
  middle of the Device Manager window, and some of the buttons on the right
  side of the window become available. For example, if you select the Software
  Security Device, you can perform these actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click Login or Logout to log in or out of the Software Security Device.
    If you are logging in, you will be asked to supply the master password for
    the device. You must be logged into a security device before your browser
    software can use it to provide cryptographic services.</li>
  <li>Click Change Password to change the master password for the device.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can perform these actions on most security devices. However, you cannot
  perform them on the Builtin Object Token or Generic Crypto Services, which
  are special devices that must normally be available at all times.</p>

<h2 id="using_security_modules">Using Security Modules</h2>

<p>If you want to use a smart card or other external security device, you must
  first install the module software on your computer and, if necessary, connect
  any associated hardware. Follow the instructions that come with the
  hardware.</p>

<p>After a new module is installed on your computer, follow these steps to load
  it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <span class="mac">&brandShortName;</span>
    <span class="noMac">Edit</span> menu and choose Preferences.</li>
  <li>Under the Privacy &amp; Security category, click Certificates. (If no

    the module file, and click Open.</li>
  <li>Fill in the Module Name field with the name of the module and click
    OK.</li>
</ol>

<p>The new module will then show up in the list of modules with the name you

<h2 id="enable_fips_mode">Enable FIPS Mode</h2>

<p>Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) 140-1 is a
  US government standard for implementations of cryptographic
  modules&mdash;that is, hardware or software that encrypts and decrypts data
  or performs other cryptographic operations (such as creating or verifying
  digital signatures). Many products sold to the US government must comply with
  one or more of the FIPS standards.</p>

<p>To enable FIPS mode for the browser, you use the Device Manager:</p>

<h1 id="managing_ssl_warnings_and_settings">Managing SSL Warnings and
Settings</h1>

<p>The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol allows your computer to exchange
  information with other computers on the Internet in encrypted form&mdash;that
  is, the information is scrambled while in transit so that no one else can
  make sense of it. SSL is also used to identify computers on the Internet by
  means of <a href="glossary.xhtml#certificate">certificates</a>.</p>

<p>The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol is a new standard based on SSL.
  By default, the browser supports both SSL and TLS. This approach works for
  most people, because it guarantees that the browser will work with virtually
  all other existing software on the Internet that supports any version of SSL
  or TLS.</p>

<p>However, in some circumstances system administrators or other knowledgeable
  persons may wish to adjust the SSL settings to fine-tune them for special
  security needs or to account for bugs in some older software products.</p>

<p>You shouldn&apos;t adjust the SSL settings for your browser unless you know
  what you&apos;re doing or have the assistance of someone else who does. If
  you do need to adjust them for some reason, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <span class="mac">&brandShortName;</span>

<h1 id="controlling_validation">Controlling Validation</h1>

<p>As discussed above under <a href="#using_certs_get">Get Your Own
  Certificate</a>, a certificate is a form of identification, much like a
  driver&apos;s license, that you can use to identify yourself over the
  Internet and other networks. However, also like a driver&apos;s license, a
  certificate may expire or become invalid for some other reason. Therefore,
  your browser software needs to confirm the validity of any given certificate
  in some way before trusting it for identification purposes.</p>

<p>This section describes how Certificate Manager validates certificates and
  how to control that process. To understand the process, you should have some
  familiarity with <a href="glossary.xhtml#public-key_cryptography">public-key
  cryptography</a>. If you are not familiar with the use of certificates, you
  should check with your system administrator before attempting to change any
  of your browser&apos;s certificate validation settings.</p>

<div class="contentsBox">In this section:
<ul>

  <li><a href="#managing_crls">Managing CRLs</a></li>
  <li><a href="#configuring_ocsp">Configuring OCSP</a></li>
  <li><a href="validation_help.xhtml">Validation Settings</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2 id="how_validation_works">How Validation Works</h2>

<p>Whenever you use or view a certificate stored by Certificate Manager, it
  takes several steps to verify the certificate. At a minimum, it confirms that
  the CA&apos;s digital signature on the certificate was created by a CA whose
  own certificate is (1) present in the Certificate Manager&apos;s list of
  available CA certificates and (2) marked as trusted for issuing the kind of
  certificate being verified.</p>

<p>If the CA certificate is not itself present, the
  <a href="glossary.xhtml#certificate_chain">certificate chain</a> for the CA
  certificate must include a higher-level CA certificate that is present and
  correctly trusted. Certificate Manager also confirms that the certificate
  being verified is currently marked as trusted in the certificate store. If
  any one of these checks fails, Certificate Manager marks the certificate as
  unverified and won&apos;t recognize the identity it certifies.</p>

<p>A certificate can pass all these tests and still be compromised in some way;
  for example, the certificate may be revoked because an unauthorized person
  has gained access to the certificate&apos;s private key. A compromised
  certificate can allow an unauthorized person (or website) to pretend to be
  the certificate owner.</p>

<p>One way to combat this threat is for Certificate Manager to check a
  certificate revocation list (CRL) as part of the verification process (see
  <a href="#managing_crls">Managing CRLs</a>, below). Typically, you download a
  CRL to your browser by clicking a link. If a CRL is present, Certificate
  Manager checks any certificate issued by the same CA against the list as part
  of the verification process.</p>

<p>The reliability of CRLs depends on the frequency with which they are both
  updated by a server and checked by a client. You can configure your
  <a href="validation_help.xhtml#automatic_crl_update_preferences">Automatic
  CRL Update Preferences</a> so that a CRL will be updated automatically at
  regular intervals with the version currently on the server.</p>

<p>Another way to combat the threat of compromised certificates is to use a
  special server that supports the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP).
  Such a server can answer client queries about individual certificates (see
  <a href="#configuring_ocsp">Configuring OCSP</a>, below).</p>

<p>The server, called an OCSP responder, receives an updated CRL periodically
  from the CA that issues the certificates to be verified. You can configure
  Certificate Manager to submit a status request for a certificate to the OCSP
  responder, and the OCSP responder confirms whether the certificate is
  valid.</p>

<p>[<a href="#controlling_validation">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="managing_crls">Managing CRLs</h2>

<p>A certificate revocation list (CRL) is list of revoked certificates. A
  <a href="glossary.xhtml#certificate_authority">certificate authority (CA)</a>
  might revoke a certificate, for example, if it has been compromised in some
  way&mdash;much the way a credit card company might revoke your credit card if
  you report that it&apos;s been stolen.</p>

<p>This section describes how to import and manage CRLs.</p>

<p>For background information, see
  <a href="#how_validation_works">How Validation Works</a>.</p>

<p>For detailed descriptions of CRL settings that you can control, see
  <a href="validation_help.xhtml">Validation Settings</a>.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<h3 id="about_the_next_update_date">About the &quot;Next Update&quot; Date</h3>

<p>The browser uses the CRLs it has available to check the validity of
  certificates issued by the corresponding CAs. If a certificate is listed as
  revoked, the browser won&apos;t accept it as evidence of identity.</p>

<p>A CA typically publishes an updated CRL at regular intervals. Every CRL
  includes a date, specified in the Next Update field, by which the CA will
  publish the next update of that CRL. In general, if the date in the Next
  Update field is earlier than the current date, you should obtain the most
  recent version of the CRL. To view CRL information and set up automatic CRL
  updating, see <a href="#viewing_and_managing_crls">Viewing and Managing
  CRLs</a>.</p>

<p>CAs are required to produce a new CRL by the Next Update date. However, the
  absence of the most recent CRL does not by itself invalidate a certificate.
  For this reason, if the most recent CRL is not available, a certificate may
  be validated even though the most recent CRL shows it as expired. Automatic
  CRL updating can help to avoid this situation.</p>

<h3 id="importing_crls">Importing CRLs</h3>

<p>You can import the latest CRL from a CA into your browser. To import a CRL,
  follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to the URL specified by the CA or by your system administrator and
    click the link for the CRL that you want to import.
    
    <p>The Import Status dialog box appears.</p>

  </li>
  <li>Confirm that the CRL was imported successfully and that it&apos;s the one
    you wanted. In most cases you should also click Yes, which enables
    automatic updating of the CRL you just imported.</li>
  <li>The next step depends on whether you click Yes or No in the Import Status
    dialog box: 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Yes:</strong> The Automatic CRL Update Preferences dialog box
        appears. In this case, go on to step 4.</li>
      <li><strong>No:</strong> The Import Status dialog box closes. If you
        change your mind and decide to enable automatic updates after all, see
	<a href="#viewing_and_managing_crls">Viewing and Managing
	CRLs</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Select the option labeled &quot;Enable Automatic Update for this
    CRL&quot;.</li>
  <li>Decide how you want to schedule the automatic updates:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Update __ days before Next Update date:</strong> Select this
        option if you want to base the update frequency on the frequency with
	which the CRL publisher publishes a new version of the CRL.</li>
      <li><strong>Update every __ days:</strong> Select this option if you want
        to specify an update interval unrelated to the CRL&apos;s Next Update
	date.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click OK to confirm your choices.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="viewing_and_managing_crls">Viewing and Managing CRLs</h3>

<p>You can view and manage CRLs available to the browser through the
  browser&apos;s Validation preferences:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <span class="mac">&brandShortName;</span>
    <span class="noMac">Edit</span> menu and choose Preferences.</li>
  <li>Under the Privacy &amp; Security category, click Validation. (If no
  subcategories are visible, double-click Privacy &amp; Security to expand the
  list.)</li>
  <li>Click Manage CRLs in the Validation panel to see a list of the CRLs
    available to Certificate Manager.</li>
</ol>

<p>To delete or update a CRL, select it and click the appropriate button.</p>

<p>To set up automatic updates for a CRL, select the CRL and click Settings.
  The Automatic CRL Update Preferences dialog box appears:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the option labeled &quot;Enable Automatic Update for this
    CRL&quot;.</li>
  <li>Decide how you want to schedule the automatic updates:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Update __ days before Next Update date.</strong> Select this
        option if you want to base the update frequency on the frequency with
	which the CRL publisher publishes a new version of the CRL.</li>
      <li><strong>Update every __ days.</strong> Select this option if you want
        to specify an update interval unrelated to the CRL&apos;s Next Update
	date.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click OK to confirm your choices.</li>
</ol>
