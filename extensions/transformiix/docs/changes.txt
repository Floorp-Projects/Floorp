Note: The changes listed here mainly reflect the core XSLT processor and
      the standalone version.

Build 20000906

-- Fixed UTF8 bug
   - reported by Steve Tinney (stinney@sas.upenn.edu)

-- Updated Expat for standalone version

Build 20000725

-- Windows Makefiles are up to date to create Mozilla module
   - thanx to Arthur Barrett and Justin Smith

Build 20000722

-- Fixed leading + trailing whitspace when printing comments
   - reported by Jeff Bailey

-- Fixed bug in ExprLexer caused by a previous patch
   - The prevToken was being set to NULL, in cases when
     it shouldn't have been
   - discovered when looking for an error reported by
     Bernhard Zwischenbrugger

Build 20000618

-- Added changes from Olivier Gerardin for improved
   handling of template parameters

Build 20000523

-- Added fix from Marc Schefer regarding OR expressions
   - If the left hand expression was false...the right
     hand expression was not evaluated (which should
     only happen if the expression is an AND expr).

-- Added support for document() function
   - implemented by Olivier Gerardin
   - The second argument to the function is not yet supported

-- Added support for lang() function
   - implemented by Marina Mechtcherikova

-- Fixed bug with doing xsl:copy-of on a document node.
   - reported by Olivier Gerardin


Build 20000420

-- Fixed document base issue with transfromiix.cpp (Nathan)
   - When an XSLT stylesheet is specified on the command line
     the document base was still defaulting to the XML document,
     instead of the stylesheet

-- Fixed bug in namespace-uri() function [NodeSetFunctionCall.cpp] - Marina
   - If an expression was passed as an argument to the function,
     which evaluated to an empty NodeSet, the context node was being
     used, which is incorrect. We now just return an empty string.

-- Fixed bug in PathExpr::matches (Marina)
   - expressions such as "foo//bar" would not always match
     properly if more than one node existed in the final
     set of "matching context nodes" (so basically if foo
     was not the root element).


Build 20000419

-- Added the generate-id function
-- Added XPath Extension Function support

Build 20000413

-- Added some bug fixes from Marina

   -- PRECEDING_SIBLING_AXIS - removed the trailing s

-- Added support for xsl:sort (kvisco)
   -- simple sorting is working...documentation to follow
-- Added StringComparator and DefaultStringComparator
   -- we need some more comparators for I18N support

   - source/xsl/expr is now source/xpath
-- Changed xslt/XSLProcessor.* to XSLTProcessor.*

-- Incorporated some changes from Olivier Gerardin for the Expat parser

Build 20000331

-- Fixed a memory leak with translate() function (kvisco)
   -- StringFunctionCall.cpp
-- Updated the necessary source files to support the changes to
   the String class (kvisco)
-- Overloaded String::toCharArray to automatically create the
   character array (tomk)
-- Changed String::toChar to String::toCharArray (tomk)


Build 20000327

Build 20000326
-- Added Peter Van der Beken's changes to net/URIUtils for integration
   within Mozilla

-- Added Marina Mechtcheriakova's changes to xml/parser/XMLParser.cpp to fix
