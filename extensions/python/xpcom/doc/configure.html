<h1>Building, Configuring and Testing Python XPCOM Package</h1>
<p>This document attempts to explain how to build, configure and test the
Python XPCOM Package. This document assumes you have already successfully
built
Mozilla from source and your environment is currently set up for such a build -
see the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/build/">Mozilla build documentation</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>PyXPCOM can be built on Windows using either the <i>nmake makefile.win</i>
process, or the <i>configure; gmake</i> process used by Linux.</p>
<h2>configure; gmake Instructions</h2>
<h3>Preparing for the build</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Apply the patch in <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129216">bugzilla
    bug 129216</a>. (If this bug is marked as &quot;FIXED&quot;, it probably
    means there is no need to apply the patch and that these docs are out of
    date)</li>
  <li>On Linux, you must have Python built for dynamic linking.&nbsp; <a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Python">ActivePython</a>
    2.1 is one such build.</li>
  <li>On Windows, you must have a Python source tree installed and built.&nbsp;
    Patches gratefully accepted that allow an installed Python to be used (it
    should not be hard!)</li>
  <li>Ensure the Python interpreter you wish to use is on your path, such that
    &quot;python&quot; will execute it correctly.&nbsp; The configure process
    uses this to locate the Python support files.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Building</h3>
<ul>
  <li>From the top-level Mozilla directory, execute <i>./configure
    --enable-extensions=python/xpcom</i>. As per the Mozilla build
    instructions, you may add this option to your <i>.mozconfig</i> file.&nbsp;
    If you wish to enable debugging, just enable it as you would normally for
    Mozilla; PyXPCOM will pick up the same settings.<br>
    (On Windows you will need to execute <i>sh ./configure ...</i> if running
    from a Command Prompt.&nbsp; See the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/build/win32.html#ss2.2b">Mozilla
    win32 specific gmake build instructions</a> for more details.</li>
  <li>Build the Mozilla tree as normal; PyXPCOM will automatically be
    built.&nbsp; Alternatively, change to the top-level PyXPCOM directory and
    execute <i>gmake</i> in that directory.</li>
</ul>
<h2>PyXPCOM outside Mozilla</h2>
<p>When you are using PyXPCOM from inside mozilla, no additional configuration
options should be necessary.&nbsp; However, if you wish to use PyXPCOM from
stand-alone Python (ie, so you can write simple Python scripts that can be
executed normally and use XPCOM), then additional environment variables must be
setup.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a name="PYTHONPATH"><b>PYTHONPATH</b></a> - <tt>PYTHONPATH</tt>  needs to
    be set appropriately.&nbsp;You must manually ensure that the <i>mozilla/dist/bin/python</i>
    directory (which is where PyXPCOM was installed during the build process) is
    listed.&nbsp; Note that when PyXPCOM is used from within Mozilla (or any
    other xpcom process), this path will automatically be added to sys.path.&nbsp;
    It is only when Python directly uses xpcom that this step is necessary.<br>
    If anything is wrong here you should get a normal <tt>ImportError</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>Note that on Windows, the PYTHONPATH is generally maintained in the
  Registry; however, you can set this variable at a DOS prompt, and it will still be
added to the core PYTHONPATH.
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><b><a name="PATH">PATH</a>, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc</b> - On Windows, you
    must ensure that the Mozilla bin directory is listed on your PATH, or that
    you execute your scripts with the Mozilla bin directory as the current
    directory.<br>
    On Linux, you must set your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables
    appropriately.&nbsp; However, you may find it simpler and easier to use the <i>run-mozilla.sh</i>
    script in the Mozilla bin directory.&nbsp; For example, changing to the
    Mozilla bin directory and executing:<br>
    <i>./run-mozilla.sh python ~/src/mozilla/extensions/python/xpcom/test/regrtest.py</i><br>
    should setup a correct environment and execute the PyXPCOM test suite.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="RunningTheTests">Testing your Setup</a></h2>
<p>The Python XPCOM Package has a complete test suite.</p>
<p>In the rest of this section, we walk through some simpler tests a step at a time,
to help diagnose any problems.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> We recommend you do all your testing outside of <i> mozilla.exe</i>; it is far simpler to test all of
this using the PyXPCOM package stand-alone.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> On Windows, if you use a debug build of Mozilla (i.e., in <i>dist\WIN32_D.OBJ\bin)</i>,
    you <b>must</b> use <i>python_d.exe</i>; if you use a release build (i.e., in
    a <i>dist\WIN32_O.OBJ\bin</i> directory), you must use <i>python.exe</i>.&nbsp;
<i>makefile.stupid.win</i> handles this automatically.</p>
<p>To test your setup:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start Python, and check<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <i>import xpcom</i><br>
    works. If not, <a href="#PYTHONPATH">check your PYTHONPATH</a> - the
    main PyXPCOM package can not be located.&nbsp; Also check your <a href="#PATH">PATH</a>,
    and if you are on Linux, remember that executing ./run-mozilla.sh python is
    the easiest way.</li>
  <li>Check<i><br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; import xpcom._xpcom</i><br>

works. If not, then most likely your <a href="#PATH">Mozilla
    directory is not on your path</a>, or something is wrong with <i>_xpcom(_d).pyd/_xpcommodule.so</i>.</li>

  <li>Next run a simple test: <i>test/test_misc.py</i>.&nbsp;With a Windows debug build, the command may look like:<br>
    <i>C:\Anywhere&gt; python_d \src\python\xpcom\test\test_misc.py<br>
    </i>or on Linux<br>
    <i>/home/user/src/mozilla/dist/bin$ python /home/user/src/python/xpcom/test/test_misc.py</i></li>
</ol>
<p>If you can't get this going, you won't get much further! (You may see a few
errors - that is OK, as long as it appears something worked!).&nbsp; If
everything looks OK, the
next step is to register our test component and run our full test suite.</p>
<h2><a name="Registration">Registering the Loader and Test Component</a></h2>
<p>First register the generic Python loader. For instructions, see the <a href="file:///F:/src/as/Komodo/src/pyxpcom/xpcom/doc/architecture.html">architecture
document</a>.&nbsp;Do this only once, regardless of how many
Python components you have.&nbsp; Then install the test component itself, and
finally you can test it!</p>
<h3>Registering the Python Loader and Component</h3>
<p>To register the Python Loader and Component:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure the build process has put <i>pyloader.dll </i>(or <i>modpyloader.so</i>
    for Unix), and the files <i> py_test_component.py </i> and <i> py_test_component.idl</i> into
    the Mozilla <i>bin/components</i> directory.&nbsp; If not, copy the files
    there manually.</li>
  <li>Run <i>regxpcom </i>(or .<i>/run-mozilla.sh ./regxpcom</i> if appropriate).&nbsp;<i>regxpcom</i> is a standard Mozilla
    executable, found in the <i>bin</i>  directory, that detects the new DLL and
    .py
    files and registers them accordingly.&nbsp; You should
    see a few messages that include the following:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <pre>Registering: PythonComponentLoader
Registered 1 Python components in pyloader.dll
nsNativeComponentLoader: autoregistering succeeded
Auto-registering all Python components in F:\src\mozilla\dist\WIN32_D.OBJ\bin\components
Registering: PythonTestComponent
Registered 1 Python components in py_test_component.py</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If so (or you see no message at all), you are ready to run the test suite.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: If you execute this same step a second time, you will not
see any of the above mentioned messages.&nbsp;XPCOM knows that nothing has
changed since you last ran <i>regxpcom</i>, so nothing is registered.&nbsp; If
you do not see these messages the first time you run it, there is the
possibility that some other process, possibly the build process, has already
executed this step.</p>
<h2><b>Running the Test Suite</b></h2>
<p>Before running the test suite, you should change to the <i>mozilla/xpcom/sample</i>
directory and build it.&nbsp; This will build and install a sample component
which is used by the test suite.&nbsp; If you do not have this component
available, some of the Python tests will fail.</p>

<p>To run the test suite, run <i>xpcom/test/regrtest.py.</i>&nbsp; This runs the
tests and ensures that the test output is as expected.&nbsp; If all tests
pass, you have a fully functioning Python XPCOM package.&nbsp; Enjoy!</p>
