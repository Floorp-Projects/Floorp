### Notes for localizers ###
#
# The following version number is the "localisation version number", and MUST
# match the locale.version in the original locale this is based on. In other
# words, if the locale.version in two files is the same, both files MUST have
# exactly the same list of locale strings.
#
# If you always start with an en-US locale, and replace all strings, you can
# leave this value alone. If you update your locale file based on changes in
# the en-US locale, please remember to always update this in your locale to
# match en-US when you're done.
#
# locale.error is the message is the message displayed to the user if the
# locale version number does not match what ChatZilla is expecting, and will
# have the the following replacements:
#
#   %1$S   ChatZilla version (e.g. "0.9.69").
#   %2$S   Expected locale version (e.g. "0.9.69").
#   %3$S   Locale being loaded (e.g. "fr-FR").
#   %4$S   Actual locale version being (e.g. "0.9.68.2").
#
# In the example above, the user would be using ChatZilla 0.9.69, which
# expects a locale version of 0.9.69. It tried to use the fr-FR locale,
# but found it was only version 0.9.68.3.
#
# Note: the ChatZilla version and expected locale versions may not always be
#       the same. For example, if only non-locale changes have been made, the
#       expected locale version will stay the same. This is to make using
#       localisations between versions easier.
#
### End of notes ###

locale.version = 0.9.76.0
locale.error = You are using ChatZilla %1$S, which requires the locale version %2$S. The currently selected locale, %3$S, is version %4$S, and therefore there may be problems running ChatZilla.\n\nIt is strongly advised that you update or remove the ChatZilla locale in question.

### Notes for localizers ###
#
# ChatZilla uses cmd.<command name>.* to construct the command's help, 
# parameters and any UI labels. For the command to continue to function, the
# *.params entries MUST NOT BE CHANGED. Hopefully in the future you will be
# able to localize these items as well.
#
### DO NOT LOCALIZE THE *.params STRINGS ###
#
# All localised strings may contain certain entities for branding purposes. 
# The three standard brand entities (brandShortName, brandFullName, vendorName)
# can all be used like this:
#     foo.bar = Some text used in &brandFullName;!
