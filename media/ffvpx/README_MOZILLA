This directory contains files used in gecko builds from FFmpeg
(http://ffmpeg.org). The current files are from v2.8.2 of the library.
All source files match their path from the library's source archive.

Currently, we only use the vp8 and vp9 portion of the library, and only on x86
based platforms. If this changes, configuration files will most likely
need to be updated.
