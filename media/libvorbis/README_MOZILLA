The source from this directory was copied from the libvorbis
subversion repository using the update.sh script. The only changes
made were those applied by update.sh and the addition/upate of
Makefile.in files for the Mozilla build system.

The svn revision number used was r16335.

Some files are renamed during the copy to prevent clashes with object
file names with other Mozilla libraries.
