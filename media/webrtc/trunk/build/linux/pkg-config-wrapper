# This program wraps around pkg-config to generate the correct include and

# The assumption is that the sysroot contains the .pc files in usr/lib/pkgconfig
# and usr/share/pkgconfig (relative to the sysroot) and that they output paths
# relative to some parent path of the sysroot.
# This assumption is valid for a range of sysroots, in particular: a
# LSB-compliant root filesystem mounted at the sysroot, and a board build
# directory of a Chromium OS chroot.

# To support this correctly, it's necessary to extract the prefix to strip from
