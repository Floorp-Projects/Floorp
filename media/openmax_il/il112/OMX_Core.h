        specified in hInput will have it's port specified in nPortInput
        setup for communication with the application / IL client.
    @param [in] nPortOutput
        nPortOutput is used to select the source port on component to be
        used in the tunnel.
    @param [in] hInput
        This is the component to setup the tunnel with. This is the handle
        of the component whose port, specified in the nPortInput parameter
        will be used the destination for the tunnel. This is the component handle
        returned by the call to the OMX_GetHandle function.  There is a
        requirement that hInput be the destination for the data when
        tunelling (i.e. nPortInut is an input port).   If 0x0, the component
        specified in hOutput will have it's port specified in nPortPOutput
        setup for communication with the application / IL client.
    @param [in] nPortInput
        nPortInput is used to select the destination port on component to be
        used in the tunnel.
    @return OMX_ERRORTYPE
        If the command successfully executes, the return code will be
        OMX_ErrorNone.  Otherwise the appropriate OMX error will be returned.
        When OMX_ErrorNotImplemented is returned, one or both components is
        a non-interop component and does not support tunneling.
