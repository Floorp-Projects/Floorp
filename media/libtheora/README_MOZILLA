bug498770.patch - Enable optimized theora code in windows build
Bug 455357 - WinCE LibTheora Pre-defined Macro usage in local variable
  455357_wince_local_variable_macro_clash_patch
  This patch is needed for building WinCE / WinMobile because the 
  Mozilla WinCE Shunt Library currently includes windows.h header file,
  which causes a conflict with local variables in the oc_dering_block()
  function.  This issue should be cleared up soon, with a reworking of 
  the WinCE Shunt Library (Bug 456788 - reduce windows ce shunt impact).  
  Until then, this simple patch allows WinCE to finish compiling.
