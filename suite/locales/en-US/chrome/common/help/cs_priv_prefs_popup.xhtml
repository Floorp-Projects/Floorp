<p><strong>What are Popups?</strong></p>

<p>Pop-up windows, or popups, are windows that appear automatically and without
  your permission. They vary in size, but usually don't cover the whole screen.
  Some popups open on top of the current Navigator window, thus popping up,
  while others appear underneath Navigator (popunders).</p>

<p>&brandShortName; allows you to control both popups and popunders through the
  <a href="#privacy_and_security_preferences_popup_windows">Popup Windows
  preferences panel</a>. Since popup blocking is turned off by default, you
  must enable it to prevent popups from appearing in Navigator.</p>

<p>When blocking a popup, &brandShortName; can be set up to play a sound, as
  well as display an icon
  <img src="chrome://navigator/skin/icons/popup-blocked.png" alt="Popup control
  icon"></img> in the status bar. You can use this icon to add a website
  you're viewing to an exceptions list so that the site is allowed to again
  display popups.</p>

<p><strong>Blocking popups may interfere with some websites</strong>: Some web
  sites, including some banking sites, use popups for important features. 
  Blocking all popups disables such features. To allow specific websites to
  use popups, while blocking all others, you can add specific websites to the
  list of allowed sites. For more information, see
  <a href="#privacy_and_security_preferences_popup_windows">Privacy &amp;
  Security Preferences - Popup Windows</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Blocking popups doesn't always work</strong>: Although
  &brandShortName; blocks most popups, some websites, even when blocked, may
  use other methods to show popups.</p>

<p><strong>Allowing popups from certain websites</strong>: After you've
  enabled popup blocking, you can still allow specific sites to display popups.
  Browse to the website, and then from the Tools menu, choose Popup Manager,
  and then choose Allow Popups From This Site.</p>

<p>The next section describes how to control popups through preferences and
  through the popup control icon.</p>

<h2 id="privacy_and_security_preferences_popup_windows">Privacy &amp; Security
  Preferences - Popup Windows</h2>

<p>This section describes how to use the Popup Windows preferences panel. If
 you're not already viewing it, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the Edit menu (&brandShortName; menu on Mac OS X) and choose
  Preferences.</li>
<li>Under the Privacy &amp; Security Preferences category, click Popup Windows.
  (If no subcategories are visible, double-click Privacy &amp; Security to
  expand the list.)</li></ol>

<ul>
<li><strong>Block unrequested popup windows:</strong> Select this to prevent
  popups from
  appearing in Navigator.</li>
<li><strong>Allowed Sites:</strong> Click this to view and edit the list of web
  sites that you want to allow to display popups.
<ul>
<li><strong>Allowed websites</strong>: The list of allowed websites appears
  when you click "Allowed Sites." You can add or remove websites that should
  be allowed to show popups.</li>
<li><strong>Add</strong>: Click this after typing in a website that you want
  to add to the list.</li>
<li><strong>Remove</strong>: Click this to remove a selected website.</li>
<li><strong>Remove All</strong>: Click this to remove all of the websites in
  the current list.</li></ul></li></ul>

<h3>When a popup window has been blocked</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Play a sound</strong>: If you want a sound to play each time
  Navigator blocks a popup, select this option and type the location of the
  sound file.
<ul>
<li><strong>Select</strong>: Click this to choose a sound file instead of
  typing its location in the field.</li>
<li><strong>Preview</strong>: Click this to listen to the chosen sound.</li>
  </ul></li>
<li><strong>Display an icon in the Navigator status bar</strong>: Select this
  to display an icon <img src="chrome://navigator/skin/icons/popup-blocked.png"
  alt="Popup control icon"></img> in the Navigator status bar to indicate that
  a popup is blocked. <strong>Note</strong>: After the popup control icon
  <img src="chrome://navigator/skin/icons/popup-blocked.png" alt="Popup control
  icon"></img> appears, it remains visible until you visit another website.
  </li></ul>

<p><strong>Using the popup control icon to add allowed websites</strong>: You
  can use the popup control icon to quickly add a website to the list of
  allowed websites. Click the icon
  <img src="chrome://navigator/skin/icons/popup-blocked.png" alt="Popup control
  icon"></img> to open the list of allowed websites. The current website is
  already filled in. Click Add and then click OK to confirm your addition.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Blocking popups may not always work and may interfere
  with some websites. For more information about blocking popups, see
