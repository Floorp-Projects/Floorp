   Invalidation model:

   2) The view manager finds the "right" widget for the view, henceforth called
      the root widget.

   3) The view manager traverses descendants of the root widget and for each
      one that needs invalidation stores the rect to invalidate on the widget's
      view (batching).

   4) The dirty region is flushed to the right widget when
      ProcessPendingUpdates is called from the RefreshDriver.

   It's important to note that widgets associated to views outside this view
   manager can end up being invalidated during step 3.  Therefore, the end of a
   view update batch really needs to traverse the entire view tree, to ensure
   that those invalidates happen.

   To cope with this, invalidation processing and should only happen on the
   root viewmanager.
