   * Flags for imgIContainer operations.

   * Meanings:
   *
   * FLAG_NONE: Lack of flags.
   *
   * FLAG_SYNC_DECODE: Forces synchronous/non-progressive decode of all
   * available data before the call returns.
   *
   * FLAG_SYNC_DECODE_IF_FAST: Like FLAG_SYNC_DECODE, but requests a sync decode
   * be performed only if ImageLib estimates it can be completed very quickly.
   *
   * FLAG_ASYNC_NOTIFY: Send notifications asynchronously, even if we decode
   * synchronously because of FLAG_SYNC_DECODE or FLAG_SYNC_DECODE_IF_FAST.
   *
   * FLAG_DECODE_NO_PREMULTIPLY_ALPHA: Do not premultiply alpha if
   * it's not already premultiplied in the image data.
   *
   * FLAG_DECODE_NO_COLORSPACE_CONVERSION: Do not do any colorspace conversion;
   * ignore any embedded profiles, and don't convert to any particular
   * destination space.
   *
   * FLAG_CLAMP: Extend the image to the fill area by clamping image sample
   * coordinates instead of by tiling. This only affects 'draw'.
   *
   * FLAG_HIGH_QUALITY_SCALING: A hint as to whether this image should be
   * scaled using the high quality scaler. Do not set this if not drawing to
   * a window or not listening to invalidations. Passing this flag will do two
   * things: 1) request a decode of the image at the size asked for by the
   * caller if one isn't already started or complete, and 2) allows a decoded
   * frame of any size (it could be neither the requested size, nor the
   * intrinsic size) to be substituted.
   *
   * FLAG_BYPASS_SURFACE_CACHE: Forces drawing to happen rather than taking
   * cached rendering from the surface cache. This is used when we are printing,
   * for example, where we want the vector commands from VectorImages to end up
   * in the PDF output rather than a cached rendering at screen resolution.
   *
   * FLAG_FORCE_PRESERVEASPECTRATIO_NONE: Force scaling this image
   * non-uniformly if necessary. This flag is for vector image only. A raster
   * image should ignore this flag. While drawing a vector image with this
   * flag, do not force uniform scaling even if its root <svg> node has a
   * preserveAspectRatio attribute that would otherwise require uniform
   * scaling , such as xMinYMin/ xMidYMin. Always scale the graphic content of
   * the given image non-uniformly if necessary such that the image's
   * viewBox (if specified or implied by height/width attributes) exactly
   * matches the viewport rectangle.
   *
   * FLAG_FORCE_UNIFORM_SCALING: Signal to ClippedImage::OptimalSizeForDest that
   * its returned size can only scale the image's size *uniformly* (by the same
   * factor in each dimension). We need this flag when painting border-image
   * section with SVG image source-data, if the SVG image has no viewBox and no
   * intrinsic size. In such a case, we synthesize a viewport for the SVG image
   * (a "window into SVG space") based on the border image area, and we need to
   * be sure we don't subsequently scale that viewport in a way that distorts
   * its contents by stretching them more in one dimension than the other.
   *
   * FLAG_AVOID_REDECODE_FOR_SIZE: If there is already a raster surface
   * available for this image, but it is not the same size as requested, skip
   * starting a new decode for said size.
   *
   * FLAG_DECODE_TO_SRGB_COLORSPACE: Instead of converting the colorspace to
   * the display's colorspace, use sRGB.
   *
   * FLAG_RECORD_BLOB: Instead of rasterizing an SVG image on the main thread,
   * record the drawing commands using blob images.

   *                by clamping image sample coordinates. Otherwise, the image
   *                will be automatically tiled as necessary. aRegion can also

   *                of pixels we're allowed to sample from when drawing; this
   *                is only of use to callers which need to draw with pixel
   *                snapping.
   * @param aWhichFrame Frame specifier of the FRAME_* variety.
   * @param aSamplingFilter The filter to be used if we're scaling the image.
   * @param aSVGContext If specified, SVG-related rendering context, such as
   *                    overridden attributes on the image document's root <svg>
   *                    node, and the size of the viewport that the full image
   *                    would occupy. Ignored for raster images.
   * @param aFlags Flags of the FLAG_* variety
