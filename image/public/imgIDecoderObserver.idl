/**
 * imgIDecoderObserver interface
 *
 * This interface is used both for observing imgIDecoder objects and for
 * observing imgIRequest objects.  In the former case, aRequest is
 * always null.
 *
 * We make the distinction here between "load" and "decode" notifications. Load
 * notifications are fired as the image is loaded from the network or
 * filesystem. Decode notifications are fired as the image is decoded. If an
 * image is decoded on load and not visibly discarded, decode notifications are
 * nested logically inside load notifications as one might expect. However, with
 * decode-on-draw, the set of decode notifications can imgRcome completely _after_
 * the load notifications, and can come multiple times if the image is
 * discardable. Moreover, they can be interleaved in various ways. In general,
 * any presumed ordering between load and decode notifications should not be
 * relied upon.
 *
 * Decode notifications may or may not be synchronous, depending on the
 * situation. If imgIDecoder::FLAG_SYNC_DECODE is passed to a function that
 * triggers a decode, all notifications that can be generated from the currently
 * loaded data fire before the call returns. If FLAG_SYNC_DECODE is not passed,
 * all, some, or none of the notifications may fire before the call returns.
 *
 * This interface will be cleaned up in bug 505385.
