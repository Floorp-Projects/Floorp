/**
 * A SurfacePipe is a pipeline that consists of a series of SurfaceFilters
 * terminating in a SurfaceSink. Each SurfaceFilter transforms the image data in
 * some way before the SurfaceSink ultimately writes it to the surface. This
 * design allows for each transformation to be tested independently, for the
 * transformations to be combined as needed to meet the needs of different
 * situations, and for all image decoders to share the same code for these
 * transformations.
 *
 * Writing to the SurfacePipe is done using lambdas that act as generator
 * functions. Because the SurfacePipe machinery controls where the writes take
 * place, a bug in an image decoder cannot cause a buffer overflow of the
 * underlying surface.
