# BMP: bihsize=40, 127 x 64, bpp=1, compression=0, colors=1
# "1 bit/pixel paletted image, with only one color in the palette. The
# documentation says that 1-bpp images have a palette size of 2 (not 'up to
# 2'), but it would be silly for a viewer not to support a size of 1."
# [We accept it. So does Chromium.]

# "An RLE-compressed image that used 'delta' codes to skip over some pixels,
# leaving them undefined. Some viewers make undefined pixels transparent,
# others make them black, and others assign them palette color 0 (purple, in
# this case)."
# [We make the undefined pixels transparent. So does Chromium.]

# preferable given that the color and pixel data must overlap, which can only
# lead to rubbish results.]
