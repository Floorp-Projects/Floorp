# Two bmp files where the offset to the start of the image data in the file
# is past the end of the file. In 1240629-1.bmp the offset us uint32_max,
# so we are testing that we don't try to allocate a buffer that size (and
# fail on 32 bit platforms) and declare the image in error state. If in the
# future we decide that such bmps (offset past the end of the file) are
# invalid the test will still pass, but won't be testing much.
