<!--
	1404366-1.ico is an ico file that contains a 32x32 0RGB (0 for all alpha values) bmp
	where the color values are all white. It also contains a mask. The mask alternates
	one pixel fully transparent, one pixel fully opaque. The result of drawing this on
	a white background should be white. This is testing that we premultiply the color
	values by the alpha derived from the mark when downscaling. If we do not skia will
	get confused and likely draw non white pixels.
