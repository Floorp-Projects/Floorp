/**
 * SurfaceCache is an ImageLib-global service that allows caching of decoded

 * SurfaceCache entries normally expire from the cache automatically if they go
 * too long without being accessed.
 *
 * Because SurfaceCache must support both normal surfaces and dynamically
 * generated surfaces, it does not actually hold surfaces directly. Instead, it
 * holds ISurfaceProvider objects which can provide access to a surface when
 * requested; SurfaceCache doesn't care about the details of how this is
 * accomplished.
 *
 * Sometime it's useful to temporarily prevent entries from expiring from the
 * cache. This is most often because losing the data could harm the user
 * experience (for example, we often don't want to allow surfaces that are
 * currently visible to expire) or because it's not possible to rematerialize
 * the surface. SurfaceCache supports this through the use of image locking; see
 * the comments for Insert() and LockImage() for more details.
 *
 * Any image which stores surfaces in the SurfaceCache *must* ensure that it
 * calls RemoveImage() before it is destroyed. See the comments for
 * RemoveImage() for more details.
