/**
 * StreamingLexer is a lexing framework designed to make it simple to write
 * image decoders without worrying about the details of how the data is arriving
 * from the network.
 *
 * To use StreamingLexer:
 *
 *  - Create a State type. This should be an |enum class| listing all of the
 *    states that you can be in while lexing the image format you're trying to
 *    read.
 *
 *  - Add an instance of StreamingLexer<State> to your decoder class. Initialize
 *    it with a Transition::To() the state that you want to start lexing in, and
 *    a Transition::To() the state you'd like to use to handle truncated data.
 *
 *  - In your decoder's DoDecode() method, call Lex(), passing in the input
 *    data and length that are passed to DoDecode(). You also need to pass
 *    a lambda which dispatches to lexing code for each state based on the State
 *    value that's passed in. The lambda generally should just continue a
 *    |switch| statement that calls different methods for each State value. Each
 *    method should return a LexerTransition<State>, which the lambda should
 *    return in turn.
 *
 *  - Write the methods that actually implement lexing for your image format.
 *    These methods should return either Transition::To(), to move on to another
 *    state, or Transition::Terminate{Success,Failure}(), if lexing has
 *    terminated in either success or failure. (There are also additional
 *    transitions for unbuffered reads; see below.)
 *
 * That's the basics. The StreamingLexer will track your position in the input
 * and buffer enough data so that your lexing methods can process everything in
 * one pass. Lex() returns Yield::NEED_MORE_DATA if more data is needed, in
 * which case you should just return from DoDecode(). If lexing reaches a
 * terminal state, Lex() returns TerminalState::SUCCESS or
 * TerminalState::FAILURE, and you can check which one to determine if lexing
 * succeeded or failed and do any necessary cleanup.
 *
 * Sometimes, the input data is truncated. StreamingLexer will notify you when
 * this happens by invoking the truncated data state you passed to the
 * constructor. At this point you can attempt to recover and return
 * TerminalState::SUCCESS or TerminalState::FAILURE, depending on whether you
 * were successful. Note that you can't return anything other than a terminal
 * state in this situation, since there's no more data to read. For the same
 * reason, your truncated data state shouldn't require any data. (That is, the
 * @aSize argument you pass to Transition::To() must be zero.) Violating these
 * requirements will trigger assertions and an immediate transition to
 * TerminalState::FAILURE.
 *
 * Some lexers may want to *avoid* buffering in some cases, and just process the
 * data as it comes in. This is useful if, for example, you just want to skip
 * over a large section of data; there's no point in buffering data you're just
 * going to ignore.
 *
 * You can begin an unbuffered read with Transition::ToUnbuffered(). This works
 * a little differently than Transition::To() in that you specify *two* states.
 * The @aUnbufferedState argument specifies a state that will be called
 * repeatedly with unbuffered data, as soon as it arrives. The implementation
 * for that state should return either a transition to a terminal state, or a
 * Transition::ContinueUnbuffered() to the same @aUnbufferedState. (From a
 * technical perspective, it's not necessary to specify the state again, but
 * it's helpful to human readers.) Once the amount of data requested in the
 * original call to Transition::ToUnbuffered() has been delivered, Lex() will
 * transition to the @aNextState state specified via Transition::ToUnbuffered().
 * That state will be invoked with *no* data; it's just called to signal that
 * the unbuffered read is over.
 *
 * It's sometimes useful for a lexer to provide incremental results, rather
 * than simply running to completion and presenting all its output at once. For
 * example, when decoding animated images, it may be useful to produce each
 * frame incrementally. StreamingLexer supports this by allowing a lexer to
 * yield.
 *
 * To yield back to the caller, a state implementation can simply return
 * Transition::ToAfterYield(). ToAfterYield()'s @aNextState argument specifies
 * the next state that the lexer should transition to, just like when using
 * Transition::To(), but there are two differences. One is that Lex() will
 * return to the caller before processing any more data when it encounters a
 * yield transition. This provides an opportunity for the caller to interact
 * with the lexer's intermediate results. The second difference is that
 * @aNextState will be called with *the same data as the state that you returned
 * Transition::ToAfterYield() from*. This allows a lexer to partially consume
 * the data, return intermediate results, and then finish consuming the data
 * when @aNextState is called.
 *
 * It's also possible to yield during an unbuffered read. Just return a
 * Transition::ContinueUnbufferedAfterYield(). Just like with
 * Transition::ContinueUnbuffered(), the @aUnbufferedState must be the same as
 * the one originally passed to Transition::ToUnbuffered(). The second argument,
 * @aSize, specifies the amount of data that the lexer has already consumed.
 * When @aUnbufferedState is next invoked, it will get the same data that it
 * received previously, except that the first @aSize bytes will be excluded.
 * This makes it easy to consume unbuffered data incrementally.
 *
 * XXX(seth): We should be able to get of the |State| stuff totally once bug
 * 1198451 lands, since we can then just return a function representing the next
 * state directly.
