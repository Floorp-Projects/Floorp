/**
 * The purpose of this class is to reconcile the problem that
 * nsHtml5StreamParser is a cycle collection participant, which means that it
 * can only be refcounted on the main thread, but
 * nsIThreadRetargetableStreamListener can be refcounted from another thread,
 * so nsHtml5StreamParser being an nsIThreadRetargetableStreamListener was
 * a memory corruption problem.
 *
 * mDelegate is an nsHtml5StreamParserPtr, which releases the object that it
 * points to from a runnable on the main thread. DropDelegate() is only called
 * on the main thread. This call will finish before the main-thread derefs the
 * nsHtml5StreamListener itself, so there is no risk of another thread making
 * the refcount of nsHtml5StreamListener go to zero and running the destructor
 * concurrently. Other than that, the thread-safe nsISupports implementation
 * takes care of the destructor not running concurrently from different
 * threads, so there is no need to have a mutex around nsHtml5StreamParserPtr to
 * prevent it from double-releasing nsHtml5StreamParser.
