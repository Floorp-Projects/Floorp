The .java files in this directory were placed here by the Java-to-C++
translator that lives in parser/html/java/translator.  Together they represent
a snapshot of the Java code that was translated to produce the corresponding
.h and .cpp files in the parent directory.  Changing these .java files is not
worthwhile, as they will just be overwritten by the next translation.  See
parser/html/java/README.txt for information about performing the translation.
