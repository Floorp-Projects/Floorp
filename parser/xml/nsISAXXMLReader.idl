 * Interface for reading an XML document using callbacks.
 *
 * NOTE: This file (and related ones) used to implement a full-featured SAX XML
 * parser. But we have few uses of this interface and the ones we have only use
 * a fraction of the full SAX functionality. So in bug 1416038 we removed a lot
 * of it. See the changes associated with that bug if you need to reintroduce
 * any of that functionality.
 *
 * nsISAXXMLReader is the interface that an XML parser's SAX2
 * driver must implement.  This interface allows an application to set
 * and query features and properties in the parser, to register event
 * handlers for document processing, and to initiate a document
 * parse.
