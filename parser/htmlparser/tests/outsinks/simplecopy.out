Simple html page
Here is a link to the mozilla.org page. Here is some underlined and boldenedified text plus some <angle bracket entities>.

Here is a line ending with a space followed by a line break. Plaintext output should contain only one space (and no line breaks) between "space" and "followed".

Here is a list:

    An item
    A nested ordered list:
        item one
        item two
    last item

Here is a paragraph after the list.
