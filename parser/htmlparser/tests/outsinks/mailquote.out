This page is a test of mail quoting.

I hope you will enjoy these quotes from /Hamlet/,
introduced by a fairly long line to see how
quotations get wrapped:

>> /(These have *br* tags after them./
>> To be, or not to be, that is the question
>> Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
>> The slings and fortunes of outrageous fortune
>> Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And
>> by opposing end them.
> 
> Oh, what a mind is here o'erthrown.
> 
>> /(The next line does not end with a *br* tag.)./
>> Oh, what a rogue and peasant slave am I. 
> 
> /(Neither does the next line:)/
> The observed of all observers, quite, quite down! 

Now we're outside all blockquotes.
