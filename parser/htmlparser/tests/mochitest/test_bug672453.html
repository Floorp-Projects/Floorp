// The general idea here is that encoding substitutions or failures to declare the encoding 
// (except when inherited or, not tested here, all-ASCII) are errors and ineffeciencies
// or risks about things failing under further editing (i.e. meta after head but within
// the extended scan zone) are warnings.
