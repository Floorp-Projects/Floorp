The test data in this directory comes from the html5lib project
(http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/). Please avoid making 
mozilla-central-specific changes to these files. If Gecko doesn't pass a test,
please add the test's input data to ../html5_tree_construction_exceptions.js
instead of removing it.

If you add or edit tests, please push the test to upstream and then 
resynchronize this directory with the upstream.

See html5lib_license.txt for the license that covers the files in this
directory.
