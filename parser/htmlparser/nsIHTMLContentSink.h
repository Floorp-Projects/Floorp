/**
 * This interface is OBSOLETE and in the process of being REMOVED.
 * Do NOT implement!
 *
 * This file declares the concrete HTMLContentSink class.
 * This class is used during the parsing process as the
 * primary interface between the parser and the content
 * model.
 *
 * After the tokenizer completes, the parser iterates over
 * the known token list. As the parser identifies valid
 * elements, it calls the contentsink interface to notify
 * the content model that a new node or child node is being
 * created and added to the content model.
 *
 * The HTMLContentSink interface assumes 4 underlying
 * containers: HTML, HEAD, BODY and FRAMESET. Before
 * accessing any these, the parser will call the appropriate
 * OpennsIHTMLContentSink method: OpenHTML,OpenHead,OpenBody,OpenFrameSet;
 * likewise, the ClosensIHTMLContentSink version will be called when the
 * parser is done with a given section.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: The parser may Open each container more than
 * once! This is due to the irregular nature of HTML files.
 * For example, it is possible to encounter plain text at
 * the start of an HTML document (that precedes the HTML tag).
 * Such text is treated as if it were part of the body.
 * In such cases, the parser will Open the body, pass the text-
 * node in and then Close the body. The body will likely be
 * re-Opened later when the actual <BODY> tag has been seen.
 *
 * Containers within the body are Opened and Closed
 * using the OpenContainer(...) and CloseContainer(...) calls.
 * It is assumed that the document or contentSink is
 * maintaining its state to manage where new content should
 * be added to the underlying document.
 *
 * NOTE: OpenHTML() and OpenBody() may get called multiple times
 *       in the same document. That's fine, and it doesn't mean
 *       that we have multiple bodies or HTML's.
 *
 * NOTE: I haven't figured out how sub-documents (non-frames)
 *       are going to be handled. Stay tuned.
