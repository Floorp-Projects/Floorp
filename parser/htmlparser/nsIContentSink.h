 * MODULE NOTES:
 * @update  gess 4/1/98
 *
 * This pure virtual interface is used as the "glue" that connects the parsing
 * process to the content model construction process.
 *
 * The icontentsink interface is a very lightweight wrapper that represents the
 * content-sink model building process. There is another one that you may care
 * about more, which is the IHTMLContentSink interface. (See that file for
 * details).
