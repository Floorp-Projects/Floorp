MailStone 4.15: Changes to Mailstone since version 4.1
	
	* Setup now checks license acceptance and configures a basic
	setup.  By default, it will also create a user LDIF file with a
	'allusers' account.
	
	* All parameters and and testbed information may now be specified
	in the workload files (*.wld).  New sections: CONFIG, CLIENT,
	MONITOR, PRETEST, and POSTTEST.  Command line parameters still
	override the files.  A complete copy of the configuration is saved
	in results/<TIMESTAMP>/all.wld.
	
	* The '*.pl', '*.tbd', and 'config*' files in ./conf/ are
	depreciated.  These should still work, but the new sections are
	simpler and more flexible.
	
	* Any CONFIG parameter can now be specified on the command line
	using the form: 'PARAMETER=value'.  Note that PARAMETER is case
	insensitive.  No whitespace is allowed before or after the '='.
	
	* The new switch '-l' or CONFIG parameter 'ClientCount' can now
	specify the total number of clients.  The 'MaxClients' and
	'MaxThreads' parameters in each CLIENT section control load
	balancing.  If the 'processes' and 'threads' parameters are set,
	then the load for that CLIENT section will not be adjusted, but
	will be taken into account when calculating other CLIENT sections.
	If just 'processes' is set, then only the thread count will be
	adjusted.  All hosts in a CLIENT section will run the same number
	of processes and threads.
	
	* bin/makeusers.pl now creates users, broadcast account, etc.
	Numbered passwords are now suppored.  The new user/password format
	now replaces '%ld' with the user number to match the rest of
	mailstone.  The ldif/ directory is obsolete.  Run "perl/bin/perl
	bin/makeusers.pl -h" for usage.
	
	* NT client machines may now be used from a Unix test master.  See
	conf/sample.wld for configuration details.
	
	* Commands can now be run for a specified block count, error
	count, or time (whichever comes first).  Set 'maxBlocks' and/or
	'maxErrors'.
	
	* Telemetry logging to /var/tmp/mstone-log.pn.tn is now performed
	when "telemetry 1" is specified.
	
	* The name used in the "CLIENT" section is now used to match
	"HOSTS=..." qualifier.  Compatibility with "hostname" is no longer
	needed.
	
	* Config values can now use quoted characters such as \n, \r, \t
	
	* Config values can be continued using \ (backslash)
	
	* System configuration information (SYSCONFIG) can now be
	specified entirely within a workload file by quoting the newlines.
	
	* Config values get enclosing double-quotes stripped
	
	* Preliminary support for HTTP and WMAP (WebMail) testing.
	
	* New table formats are easier to interpret and allow more protocols.
	
	* The new text format report is easier to machine processes.
	
	* The following command line switches are now obsolete: -f, -g,
	-e, -p, and -l.  The same functionality can be obtained by
	FREQUENCY=<interval>, GNUPLOT=<path>, RSH=<path>, RCP=<path>, and
	TEMPDIR=<directory> respectively.
	
	* File backups are now created.  When ./process is run multiple
	times, the old files are moved to the ./tmp/<TIMESTAMP>/
	directory.
	
	* perl has been updated to include full perl5.005_03 install
	package.  Perl support for each architecture is now under the
	perl/ directory.
