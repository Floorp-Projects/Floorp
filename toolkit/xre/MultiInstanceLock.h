// These functions manage "multi-instance locks", which are a type of lock
// specifically designed to allow instances of an application, process, or other
// task to detect when other instances relevant to them are running. Each
// instance opens a lock and holds it for the duration of the task of interest
// (which may be the lifetime of the process, or a shorter period). Then while
// the lock is open, it can be used to check whether any other instances of the
// same task are currently running out of the same copy of the binary, in the
// context of any OS user. A process can open any number of locks, so long as
// they use different names. It is necessary for the process to have permission
// to create files in /tmp/ on POSIX systems or ProgramData\[vendor]\ on
// Windows, so this mechanism may not work for sandboxed processes.

// The implementation is based on file locking. An empty file is created in a
// systemwide (not per-user) location, and a shared (read) lock is taken on that
// file; the value that OpenMultiInstanceLock() returns is the file
// handle/descriptor. When you call IsOtherInstanceRunning(), it will attempt to
// convert that shared lock into an exclusive (write) lock. If that operation
// would succeed, it means that there must not be any other shared locks
// currently taken on that file, so we know there are no other instances
// running. This is a more complex design than most file locks or most other
// concurrency mechanisms, but it is necessary for this use case because of the
// requirement that an instance must be able to detect other instances that were
// started later than it was. If, say, a mutex were used, or another kind of
// exclusive lock, then the first instance that tried to take it would succeed,
// and be unable to tell that another instance had tried to take it later and
// failed. This mechanism allows any number of instances started at any time in
// relation to one another to always be able to detect that the others exist
// (although it does not allow you to know how many others exist). The lock is
// guaranteed to be released if the process holding it crashes or is exec'd into
// something else, because the file is closed when that happens. The file itself
// is not necessarily always deleted on POSIX, because it isn't possible (within
// reason) to guarantee that unlink() is called, but the file is empty and
// created in the /tmp directory, so should not be a serious problem.
