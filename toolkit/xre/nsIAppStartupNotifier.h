/*
 Some components need to be run at the startup of mozilla or embedding - to
 start new services etc.

 This interface provides a generic way to start up arbitrary components
 without requiring them to hack into main1() (or into NS_InitEmbedding) as
 it's currently being done for services such as wallet, command line handlers
 etc.

 We will have a category called "app-startup" which components register
 themselves in using the CategoryManager.

 Components can also (optionally) add the word "service," as a prefix
 to the "value" they pass in during a call to AddCategoryEntry() as
 shown below:

    categoryManager->AddCategoryEntry(APPSTARTUP_CATEGORY, "testcomp",
                        "service," NS_WALLETSERVICE_CONTRACTID
                        true, true,
                        getter_Copies(previous));

 Presence of the "service" keyword indicates the components desire to
 be started as a service. When the "service" keyword is not present
 we just do a do_CreateInstance.

 When mozilla starts (and when NS_InitEmbedding()) is invoked
 we create an instance of the AppStartupNotifier component (which
 implements nsIObserver) and invoke its Observe() method.

 Observe()  will enumerate the components registered into the
 APPSTARTUP_CATEGORY and notify them that startup has begun
 and release them.

#define APPSTARTUP_CATEGORY "app-startup"

/*
 Please note that there's not a new interface in this file.
 We're just leveraging nsIObserver instead of creating a
 new one
