# LOCALIZATION NOTE (general.useragent.locale):
# This is the valid BCP 47 language tag representing your locale.
#
# In most cases, this will simply be your locale code. However, in rare cases
# (such as 'jp-JP-mac'), you may need to modify your locale code in order to
# make it a valid BCP 47 language tag. (If your locale code does not include a
# region subtag, do not include one in the language tag representing your
# locale.)
general.useragent.locale=en-US

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (intl.accept_languages):
# This is a comma-separated list of valid BCP 47 language tags.
#
# Begin with the value of 'general.useragent.locale'. Next, include language
# tags for other languages that you expect most users of your locale to be
# able to speak, so that their browsing experience degrades gracefully if
# content is not available in their primary language.
#
# It is recommended that you include "en-US, en" at the end of the list as a
# last resort. However, if you know that users of your locale would prefer a
# different variety of English, or if they are not likely to understand
# English at all, you may opt to include a different English language tag, or
# to exclude English altogether.
#
# For example, the Breton [br] locale might consider including French and
# British English in their list, since those languages are commonly spoken in
# the same area as Breton:
# intl.accept_languages=br, fr-FR, fr, en-GB, en
intl.accept_languages=en-US, en

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (font.language.group):
# This preference controls the initial setting of the language drop-down menu
# in the Content > Fonts & Colors > Advanced preference panel.
#
# Set it to the value of one of the menuitems in the "selectLangs" menulist in
# http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/components/preferences/fonts.xul
font.language.group=x-western

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (intl.charset.detector, intl.charset.default, intl.charsetmenu.browser.static, intl.charsetmenu.mailedit):
# For the list of canonical charset values, refer to:
# http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/intl/locale/src/charsetalias.properties
#
# If you are modifying the charset preferences for your locale, be sure to use
# the values from that list, not the keys. Note that these values are
# case-sensitive and must be reproduced exactly as listed.
#
# Note also that the list of charsets in 'intl.charsetmenu.browser.static'
# must always include "UTF-8".

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (pluralRule): Pick the appropriate plural rule for your
