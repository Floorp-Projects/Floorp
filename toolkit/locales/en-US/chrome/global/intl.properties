# LOCALIZATION NOTE (intl.accept_languages):
# This is a comma-separated list of valid BCP 47 language tags.
#
# Begin with the language tag of your locale. Next, include language
# tags for other languages that you expect most users of your locale to be
# able to speak, so that their browsing experience degrades gracefully if
# content is not available in their primary language.
#
# It is recommended that you include "en-US, en" at the end of the list as a
# last resort. However, if you know that users of your locale would prefer a
# different variety of English, or if they are not likely to understand
# English at all, you may opt to include a different English language tag, or
# to exclude English altogether.
#
# For example, the Breton [br] locale might consider including French and
# British English in their list, since those languages are commonly spoken in
# the same area as Breton:
# intl.accept_languages=br, fr-FR, fr, en-GB, en
intl.accept_languages=en-US, en

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (font.language.group):
# This preference controls the initial setting of the language drop-down menu
# in the Fonts and Colors > Advanced preference panel.
#
# Set it to the value of one of the menuitems in the "selectLangs" menulist in
# http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/preferences/dialogs/fonts.xhtml
font.language.group=x-western

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (pluralRule): Pick the appropriate plural rule for your
# language. This will determine how many plural forms of a word you will need
# to provide and in what order.
# See: http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Localization_and_Plurals
pluralRule=1

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (intl.menuitems.alwaysappendaccesskeys, intl.menuitems.insertseparatorbeforeaccesskeys):
# Valid values are: true, false, <empty string>
# Missing preference or empty value equals false.
intl.menuitems.alwaysappendaccesskeys=
intl.menuitems.insertseparatorbeforeaccesskeys=true
