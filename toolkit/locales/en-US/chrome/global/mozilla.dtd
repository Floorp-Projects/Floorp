'The <em>twins</em> of Mammon quarrelled. Their warring plunged the world into a <em>new darkness</em>, and the beast 
abhorred the darkness. So it began to move <em>swiftly</em>, and grew more powerful, and went forth and multiplied. 
And the beasts brought <em>fire</em> and light to the darkness.'>
