# LOCALIZATION NOTE : FILE This file contains the application's labels for keys on the keyboard.
#                     If you decide to translate this file, you should translate it based on
#                     the prevalent kind of keyboard for your target user.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE : There are two types of keys, those w/ text on their labels
#                     and those w/ glyphs.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE : VK_<â€¦> represents a key on the keyboard.
#
# For more information please see bugzilla bug 90888.

# F1..F10 should probably not be translated unless there are keyboards that actually have other labels
# F11..F20 might be something else, but are really keyboard specific and not region/language specific
# there are actually two different F11/F12 keys, I don't know which one these labels represent.
# eg, F13..F20 on a sparc keyboard are labeled Props, Again .. Find, Cut
# sparc also has Stop, Again and F11/F12. VK_F11/VK_F12 probably map to Stop/Again
