## Details within processes

# Single-line summary of threads (non-idle process)
# Variables:
#    $number (Number) The number of threads in the process. Typically larger
#                     than 30. We don't expect to ever have processes with less
#                     than 5 threads.
#    $active (Number) The number of active threads in the process.
#                     The value will be greater than 0 and will never be
#                     greater than $number.

##    $deltaSign (String) Either "+" if the amount of memory has increased
##                        or "-" if it has decreased.
##    $deltaUnit (String) The unit in which to display $delta. See the definitions
