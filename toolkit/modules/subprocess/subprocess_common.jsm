   * Resolves to an object with an `exitCode` property, containing the
   * process's exit code, once the process has exited.
   *
   * On Unix-like systems, a negative exit code indicates that the
   * process was killed by a signal whose signal number is the absolute
   * value of the error code. On Windows, an exit code of -9 indicates
   * that the process was killed via the {@linkcode BaseProcess#kill kill()}
   * method.
