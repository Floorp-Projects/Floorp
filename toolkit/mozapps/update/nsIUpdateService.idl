 * hold off on performing update tasks until there are no other instances or
 * until a timeout expires, whichever comes first. That way we can avoid
 * updating behind the back of copies that are still running, so we don't force
 * all running instances to restart (see bug 1366808, where an error was added
 * informing the user of the need to restart any running instances that have
