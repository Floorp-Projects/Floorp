background-update:
  description: |
    This ping measures the technical health of the background update system.
    Said system downloads and processes updates when Firefox is not running.  It
    is expected that this ping will be analyzed by humans to gain confidence in
    the implementation as the staged rollout of the system proceeds to the
    release channel, before settling into an automated analysis to detect spikes
    in background update failure rates.  This ping will also help to
    characterize the update-related settings of our user population.

    Right now the background update system, and therefore this ping, is
    restricted to Windows.

    This ping is submitted only by the background update task.  It should be
    submitted once per background update task invocation.  The expected schedule
    is every 7 hours, controlled by the pref `app.update.background.interval`,
    and subject to scheduling decisions made by the OS.
