// This is the script that runs in the child xpcshell process for the test
// unit_aus_update/updateSyncManager.js.
// The main thing this script does is override the child's directory service
// so that it ends up with the same fake binary path that the parent test runner
// has opened its update lock with.
// This requires that we have already been passed a constant on our command
// line which contains the relevant fake binary path, which is called:
/* global customExePath */
// We also need this builtin function from xpcshell itself:
/* global simulateNoScriptActivity */

// This function is copied from xpcshellUtilsAUS.js so that we can have our
// xpcshell subprocess call it without having to load that whole file, because
// it turns out that needs a bunch of infrastructure that normally the testing
// framework would provide, and that also requires a bunch of setup, and it's
// just not worth all that. This is a cut down version that only includes the
// directory provider functionality that the subprocess really needs.
