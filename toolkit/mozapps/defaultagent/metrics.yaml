  previous_browser:
    type: string
    description: >
      Which browser was set as the system default before it was changed to the
      current setting. The possible values are the same as for
      `system_default.browser`.

      The OS does not keep track of previous default settings, so the agent
      records this information itself. That means that it will be inaccurate
      until the first time the default is changed after the agent task begins
      running. Before then, the value of `previous_browser` will be the same
      as `browser`.

      This value is updated every time the Default Agent runs, so when the
      default browser is first changed the values for `browser` and
      `previous_browser` will be different. But on subsequent executions of
      the Default Agent, the two values will be the same.

  action:
    type: string
    description: >
      The action that the user took in response to the notification. Possible
      values currently include the following:
      * “dismissed-by-timeout”
      * “dismissed-to-action-center”
      * “dismissed-by-button”
      * “dismissed-by-application-hidden”
      * “make-firefox-default-button”
      * “toast-clicked”

      Many of the values correspond to buttons on the notification and should be
      pretty self explanatory, but a few are less so.
      * “dismissed-to-action-center” will be used if the user clicks the arrow in
        the top right corner of the notification to dismiss it to the
        action center.
      * “dismissed-by-application-hidden” is provided because that is a method of
        dismissal that the notification API could give but, in practice, should
        never be seen.
      * “dismissed-by-timeout” indicates that the user did not interact with the
        notification and it timed out.
