 * A helper module to collect all principals that have any of the following:

 *  * quota storage (indexedDB, localStorage)
 *  * service workers
 *

 *  full origin (including scheme), the https:// scheme will be used as a convention,
 *  so when the cookie hostname is .example.com the principal will have the origin
 *  https://example.com. Origin Attributes from cookies are copied to the principal.
 *
 *  This class is not a singleton and needs to be instantiated using the constructor
 *  before usage. The class instance will cache the last list of principals.
 *
 *  There is currently no `refresh` method, though you are free to add one.
