/**
 * The Remote Container interface provides a base class for services that want
 * to provide containers for bookmarks.  Some examples of possible services are
 * the livemarks service and the filesystem.
 *
 * There are two primary modes of operation: container services might create
 * actual bookmarks, or they might fill containers on the fly as needed. The
 * livemarks service, for example, queries the feed from time to time and
 * creates actual bookmarks in the folder corresponding to the feed. This way
 * the items are persistent even if the user is offline, and can be searched.
 * In this mode, the service just looks for moves and deletes to update the
 * corresponding bookkeeping information. It can use the normal population
 * method provided by the bookmark service and need not do any work for the
 * onContainerOpen message.
 *
 * Such a bookmark-based container service might listen for onContainerOpening
 * notifications messages to see whether 
 
 *
 * Persistent bookmarks are not appropriate for more short-lived data, such as
 * the filesystem interface. In this case, the service can fill result nodes
 * directly into the container when it is being opened. It can use the property
 * bag on every result node to store data associated with each item, such as
 * full path on disk. It would create additional containers for each folder,
 * resgistered to its service. These dynamic containers are not bookmark
 * folders in contrast to the initial item.
