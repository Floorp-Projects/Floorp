             impossible to get to an nsIWebBrowserChrome from aParent, this

             escaped, if applicable. can be null.
      @param aName window name from JS window.open. can be null.  If a window
             with this name already exists, the openWindow call may just load
             aUrl in it (if aUrl is not null) and return it.
      @param aFeatures window features from JS window.open. can be null.
      @param aCalledFromScript true if we were called from script.
      @param aDialog use dialog defaults (see nsGlobalWindowOuter::OpenInternal)
      @param aNavigate true if we should navigate the new window to the
             specified URL.
      @param aArgs Window argument
      @param aIsPopupSpam true if the window is a popup spam window; used for
                          popup blocker internals.
      @param aForceNoOpener If true, force noopener behavior.  This means not
                            looking for existing windows with the given name,
                            not setting an opener on the newly opened window,
                            and returning null from this method.
      @param aLoadState if aNavigate is true, this allows the caller to pass in
                        an nsIDocShellLoadState to use for the navigation.
                       Callers can pass in null if they want the windowwatcher
                       to just construct a loadinfo itself.  If aNavigate is
                       false, this argument is ignored.

      @return the new window

      @note This method may examine the JS context stack for purposes of
            determining the security context to use for the search for a given
            window named aName.
      @note This method should try to set the default charset for the new
            window to the default charset of the document in the calling window
            (which is determined based on the JS stack and the value of
            aParent).  This is not guaranteed, however.
