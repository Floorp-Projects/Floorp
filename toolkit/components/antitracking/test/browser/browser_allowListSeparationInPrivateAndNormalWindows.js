// This test works by setting up an exception for the private window allow list
// manually, and it then expects to see some blocking notifications (note the
// document.cookie setter in the blocking callback.)
// If the exception lists aren't handled separately, we'd get confused and put
// the pages loaded under this test in the allow list, which would result in
// the test not passing because no blocking notifications would be observed.

// Testing the reverse case would also be interesting, but unfortunately there
// isn't a super easy way to do that with our antitracking test framework since
// private windows wouldn't send any blocking notifications as they don't have
// storage access in the first place.
