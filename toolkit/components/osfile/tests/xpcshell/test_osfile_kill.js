/**
 * Verify that Scheduler.kill() interacts with other OS.File requests correctly,
 * and that no requests are lost.  This is relevant because on B2G we
 * auto-kill the worker periodically, making it very possible for valid requests
 * to be interleaved with the automatic kill().
 *
 * This test is being created with the fix for Bug 1125989 where `kill` queue
 * management was found to be buggy.  It is a glass-box test that explicitly
 * re-creates the observed failure situation; it is not guaranteed to prevent
 * all future regressions.  The following is a detailed explanation of the test
 * for your benefit if this test ever breaks or you are wondering what was the
 * point of all this.  You might want to skim the code below first.
 *
 * OS.File maintains a `queue` of operations to be performed.  This queue is
 * nominally implemented as a chain of promises.  Every time a new job is
 * OS.File.push()ed, it effectively becomes the new `queue` promise.  (An
 * extra promise is interposed with a rejection handler to avoid the rejection
 * cascading, but that does not matter for our purposes.)
 *
 * The flaw in `kill` was that it would wait for the `queue` to complete before
 * replacing `queue`.  As a result, another OS.File operation could use `push`
 * (by way of OS.File.post()) to also use .then() on the same `queue` promise.
 * Accordingly, assuming that promise was not yet resolved (due to a pending
 * OS.File request), when it was resolved, both the task scheduled in `kill`
 * and in `post` would be triggered.  Both of those tasks would run until
 * encountering a call to worker.post().
 *
 * Re-creating this race is not entirely trivial because of the large number of
 * promises used by the code causing control flow to repeatedly be deferred.  In
 * a slightly simpler world we could run the follwing in the same turn of the
 * event loop and trigger the problem.
 * - any OS.File request
 * - Scheduler.kill()
 * - any OS.File request
 *
 * However, we need the Scheduler.kill task to reach the point where it is
 * waiting on the same `queue` that another task has been scheduled against.
 * Since the `kill` task yields on the `killQueue` promise prior to yielding
 * on `queue`, however, some turns of the event loop are required.  Happily,
 * for us, as discussed above, the problem triggers when we have two promises
 * scheduled on the `queue`, so we can just wait to schedule the second OS.File
 * request on the queue.  (Note that because of the additional then() added to
 * eat rejections, there is an important difference between the value of
 * `queue` and the value returned by the first OS.File request.)
