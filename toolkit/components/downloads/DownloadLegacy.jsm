/**
 * nsITransfer implementation that provides a bridge to a Download object.
 *
 * Legacy downloads work differently than the JavaScript implementation.  In the
 * latter, the caller only provides the properties for the Download object and
 * the entire process is handled by the "start" method.  In the legacy
 * implementation, the caller must create a separate object to execute the
 * download, and then make the download visible to the user by hooking it up to
 * an nsITransfer instance.
 *
 * Since nsITransfer instances may be created before the download system is
 * initialized, and initialization as well as other operations are asynchronous,
 * this implementation is able to delay all progress and status notifications it
 * receives until the associated Download object is finally created.
 *
 * Conversely, the DownloadLegacySaver object can also receive execution and
 * cancellation requests asynchronously, before or after it is connected to
 * this nsITransfer instance.  For that reason, those requests are communicated
 * in a potentially deferred way, using promise objects.
 *
 * The component that executes the download implements nsICancelable to receive
 * cancellation requests, but after cancellation it cannot be reused again.
 *
 * Since the components that execute the download may be different and they
 * don't always give consistent results, this bridge takes care of enforcing the
 * expectations, for example by ensuring the target file exists when the
 * download is successful, even if the source has a size of zero bytes.
