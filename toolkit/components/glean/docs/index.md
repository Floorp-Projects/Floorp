# Firefox on Glean (FOG)

Firefox on Glean (FOG) is the name of the layer that integrates the
[Glean SDK][glean-sdk] into
[Firefox Desktop](https://www.firefox.com/).
It is currently being designed and implemented.

The [Glean SDK][glean-sdk]
is a data collection library built by Mozilla for use in its products.
Like [Telemetry][telemetry], it can be used to
(in accordance with our [Privacy Policy][privacy-policy])
send anonymous usage statistics to Mozilla in order to make better decisions.

If you have any questions, please reach out to the team on
[#glean:mozilla.org][glean-matrix].
