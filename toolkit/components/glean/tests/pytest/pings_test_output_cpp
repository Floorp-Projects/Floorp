 * Pipeline that the user wishes to have their reported Telemetry data deleted. As
 * such it attempts to send itself at the moment the user opts out of data

 * (except events). The reported data is tied to the ping's *measurement window*,
 * which is the time between the collection of two `metrics` ping. Ideally, this
 * window is expected to be about 24 hours, given that the collection is scheduled
 * daily at 4AM. Data in the `ping_info` section of the ping can be used to infer
 * the length of this window.
