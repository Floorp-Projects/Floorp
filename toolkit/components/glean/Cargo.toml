# In theory we only need this for `target_os = "android"` builds.
# Cargo has the ability to do that with `[target.'cfg(target_os = "android")'.dependencies]`.
# However that seems to confuse `cbindgen` quite a lot;
# it suddenly starts generating completely unrelated code and not adhering to the cbindgen.toml configuration
# placed next to this file.
# So for now we unconditionally depend on it, but in the code we only `extern crate` it on Android builds.
# While `glean-ffi` is still built (I think it is),
# it's not linked into the final library.
