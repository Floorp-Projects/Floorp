# Tests that need to run with e10s only must NOT be placed here,
# but in xpcshell-common-e10s.ini.
# A test here will only run on one configuration, e10s + in-process extensions,
# while the primary target is e10s + out-of-process extensions.
# xpcshell-common-e10s.ini runs in both configurations.
