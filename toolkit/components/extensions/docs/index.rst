WebExtensions API Development
=============================

This documentation covers the implementation of WebExtensions inside Firefox.
Documentation about existing WebExtension APIs and how to use them
to develop WebExtensions is available
`on MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions>`_.

To use this documentation, you should already be familiar with
WebExtensions, including
`the anatomy of a WebExtension <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Anatomy_of_a_WebExtension>`_
and `permissions <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions>`_.
You should also be familiar with concepts from
`Firefox development <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide>`_
including `e10s <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Multiprocess_Firefox>`_
in particular.
