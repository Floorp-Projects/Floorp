        This allows extra parameters to be set for search engines requests including,
        where calls to the suggestions API, the search engine configuration defines
        those parameters.

        The use of this field should be coordinated with the Search team.

        The field value is an array of objects with key/value fields. For example:

        [
          {"key": "google_channel_row", "value": "foo"}
        ]

        This is matched to a section in the search configuration:

        "extraParams": [
          {
            "name": "channel",
            "pref": "google_channel_row",
            "condition": "pref"
          }
        ],

        In this case, the resulting URL for the appropriate search engine would have
        `&channel=foo` added to the URL when doing searches.

        If the key is not referenced in the search configuration, then no parameter
        will be added. Only the search team can update the configuration.

        frequently" command will be hidden, and the user can continue to trigger
        the weather suggestion by typing 6 characters, but they will not be able

#
# Instructions for adding a new fxms-message-* placeholder feature id
# 1) clone an existing one here
# 2) update the YAML feature id to the next unused number
# 3) update the YAML description
# 4) add the new feature id to MESSAGING_EXPERIMENTS_DEFAULT_FEATURES list in MessagingExperimentConstants.sys.mjs
# 5) add the new feature id and the version it landed to the spreadsheet tab linked to above
