        "The battery life is unreal. Having a good solar charger really helps out. Garmin once again has nailed a product.",
        "Apples watch stands out so much its an annoucement. It reminds me of my pebble watches.",
        "Most of the functionality comes from the sensor, but it's far superior in every other aspect. The watch menus aren't a problem, if you're ok dealing with complex little gadgets. It seems to be great at a lot of other things too, but i'm not familiar enough to discuss.",
        "The companion android app is very good. The phone finder works well. It's easy to see quick snippets of emails or texts on the watch."

      "cons": [
        "Garmin restricts language compatibility based on region. They sell a tactical branded watch and then don't warranty their glass."
