/**
 * Managing safe shutdown of asynchronous services.
 *
 * Firefox shutdown is composed of phases that take place
 * sequentially. Typically, each shutdown phase removes some
 * capabilities from the application. For instance, at the end of
 * phase profileBeforeChange, no service is permitted to write to the
 * profile directory (with the exception of Telemetry). Consequently,
 * if any service has requested I/O to the profile directory before or
 * during phase profileBeforeChange, the system must be informed that
 * these requests need to be completed before the end of phase
 * profileBeforeChange. Failing to inform the system of this
 * requirement can (and has been known to) cause data loss.
 *
 * Example: At some point during shutdown, the Add-On Manager needs to
 * ensure that all add-ons have safely written their data to disk,
 * before writing its own data. Since the data is saved to the
 * profile, this must be completed during phase profileBeforeChange.
 *
 * AsyncShutdown.profileBeforeChange.addBlocker(
 *   "Add-on manager: shutting down",
 *   function condition() {
 *     // Do things.
 *     // Perform I/O that must take place during phase profile-before-change
 *     return promise;
 *   }
 * });
 *
 * In this example, function |condition| will be called at some point
 * during phase profileBeforeChange and phase profileBeforeChange
 * itself is guaranteed to not terminate until |promise| is either
 * resolved or rejected.
