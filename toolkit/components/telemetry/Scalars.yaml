      If a BITS download fails on the Windows side (that is to say, BITS
      ecounters an error rather than Firefox failing to interact with BITS),
      it will likely give an hresult error indicating what happened. This probe
      reports those error codes to allow us to see if BITS is commonly failing
      on some systems. This probe is keyed on the type of update download,
