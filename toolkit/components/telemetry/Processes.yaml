# This lists the known child processes we collect Telemetry for.
# The entries are keyed with the names used in Telemetry internally, the same name that is used
# in the main pings payload, i.e. "payload/processes/<process name>". See:
# https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/data/main-ping.html#processes
#
# For now this is only used to inform the data pipeline about new processes, but will be used to
# generate headers with C++ data later (enums, strings, ...).
