legacy.telemetry:
  client_id:
    type: uuid
    description: |
      The client_id according to Telemetry.
      Might not always have a value due to being too early for it to have
      loaded.
      Value may be the canary client id `c0ffeec0-ffee-c0ff-eec0-ffeec0ffeec0`
      in pings near when the data upload pref is disabled (if Telemetry gets
      to go first), or between when a client_id has been removed and when it
      has been regenerated.
      Does not need to be sent in the Glean "deletion-request" ping.

      The `profileSubsessionCounter` from the Legacy Telemetry "main" ping.
      This is a value that monotonically increases once for every "main" ping
      that has been submitted.
      It is a sequence number by a longer name.
