    description: |
      The client_id according to Telemetry.
      Might not always have a value due to being too early for it to have
      loaded.
      Value may be the canary client id `c0ffeec0-ffee-c0ff-eec0-ffeec0ffeec0`
      in pings near when the data upload pref is disabled (if Telemetry gets
      to go first), or between when a client_id has been removed and when it
      has been regenerated.
      Does not need to be sent in the Glean "deletion-request" ping.
