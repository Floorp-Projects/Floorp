payload.processes[...].events[...].resolvedDllName
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The effective path to the module file, sanitized to remove any potentially
sensitive information. In most cases, the directory path is removed leaving only
the leaf name, e.g. ``foo.dll``. There are three exceptions:

* Paths under ``%ProgramFiles%`` are preserved, e.g. ``%ProgramFiles%\FooApplication\foo.dll``
* Paths under ``%SystemRoot%`` are preserved, e.g. ``%SystemRoot%\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\nvlt.inf_amd64_97992900c592012e\nvinitx.dll``
* Paths under the temporary path are preserved, e.g. ``%TEMP%\bin\foo.dll``

payload.processes[...].events[...].requestedDllName
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The name of the module as it was requested from the OS. This string is also
sanitized in a similar fashion to to ``resolvedDllName``. This string is
omitted from the ping when it is identical to ``resolvedDllName``.

Notes
~~~~~
* The client id is submitted with this ping.
* The :doc:`Telemetry Environment <../data/environment>` is submitted in this ping.
* String fields within ``payload`` are limited in length to 260 characters.
* This ping is sent once daily.
* If there are no events to report, this ping is not sent.
