"main" ping
===========

This is the "main" Telemetry ping type, whose payload contains most of the measurements that are used to track the performance and health of Firefox in the wild.
It includes the histograms and other performance and diagnostic data.

This ping is triggered by different scenarios, which is documented by the ``reason`` field:

* ``aborted-session`` - this ping is regularly saved to disk (every 5 minutes), overwriting itself, and deleted at shutdown. If a previous aborted session ping is found at startup, it gets sent to the server. The first aborted-session ping is generated as soon as Telemetry starts
* ``environment-change`` - the :doc:`environment` changed, so the session measurements got reset and a new subsession starts
* ``shutdown`` - triggered when the browser session ends
* ``daily`` - a session split triggered in 24h hour intervals at local midnight. If an ``environment-change`` ping is generated by the time it should be sent, the daily ping is rescheduled for the next midnight
* ``saved-session`` - the *"classic"* Telemetry payload with measurements covering the whole browser session (only submitted for a transition period)

Most reasons lead to a session split, initiating a new *subsession*. We reset important measurements for those subsessions.

*Note:* ``saved-session`` is sent with a different ping type (``saved-session``, not ``main``), but otherwise has the same format as discussed here.

info
----

sessionLength
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The length of the current session so far in seconds.
This uses a monotonic clock, so this may mismatch with other measurements that
are not monotonic like calculations based on ``Date.now()``.

If the monotonic clock failed, this will be ``-1``.

subsessionLength
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The length of this subsession in seconds.
This uses a monotonic clock, so this may mismatch with other measurements that are not monotonic (e.g. based on Date.now()).

If ``sessionLength`` is ``-1``, the monotonic clock is not working.

threadHangStats
---------------
Contains the statistics about the hangs in main and background threads. Note that hangs in this section capture the [C++ pseudostack](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Performance/Profiling_with_the_Built-in_Profiler#Native_stack_vs._Pseudo_stack) and an incomplete JS stack, which is not 100% precise.

To avoid submitting overly large payloads, some limits are applied:

* Identical, adjacent "(chrome script)" or "(content script)" stack entries are collapsed together. If a stack is reduced, the "(reduced stack)" frame marker is added as the oldest frame.
* The depth of the reported stacks is limited to 11 entries. This value represents the 95th percentile of the thread hangs stack depths reported by Telemetry.

    "threadHangStats" : [
      {
        "name" : "Gecko",
        "activity" : {...}, // a time histogram of all task run times

      },
      ... other threads ...
     ]

chromeHangs
-----------
Contains the statistics about the hangs happening exclusively on the main thread of the parent process. Precise C++ stacks are reported. This is only available on Nightly Release on Windows, when building using "--enable-profiling" switch.

Some limits are applied:

* Reported chrome hang stacks are limited in depth to 50 entries.
* The maximum number of reported stacks is 50.

        ...
      ]
    },

webrtc
------
Contains special statistics gathered by WebRTC releated components.

So far only a bitmask for the ICE candidate type present in a successful or
failed WebRTC connection is getting reported through C++ code as
IceCandidatesStats, because the required bitmask is too big to be represented
in a regular enum histogram. Further this data differentiates between Loop
(aka Firefox Hello) connections and everything else, which is categorized as
WebRTC.

Note: in most cases the webrtc and loop dictionaries inside of
IceCandidatesStats will simply be empty as the user has not used any WebRTC
PeerConnection at all during the ping report time.

    "webrtc": {
      "IceCandidatesStats": {
        "webrtc": {
