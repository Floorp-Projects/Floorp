Telemetry
=========

Telemetry is a feature that allows data collection. This is being used to collect performance metrics and other information about how Firefox performs in the wild.

Client-side, this consists of:

* :doc:`data collection <collection/index>`, e.g. in histograms and scalars
* assembling :doc:`concepts/pings` with the general information and the data payload
* sending them to the server and local ping retention

*Note:* Mozilla's `data collection policy <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Data_Collection>`_ documents the process and requirements that are applied here.
