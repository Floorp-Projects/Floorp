Data collection
===============

There are different APIs and formats to collect data in Firefox, all suiting different use cases.

In general, we aim to submit data in a common format where possible. This has several advantages; from common code and tooling to sharing analysis know-how.

In cases where this isn't possible and more flexibility is needed, we can submit custom pings or consider adding different data formats to existing pings.

*Note:* Every new data collection must go through a `data collection review <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Data_Collection>`_.

The current data collection possibilities include:

* :doc:`scalars` allow recording of a single value (string, boolean, a number)
* :doc:`histograms` can efficiently record multiple data points
* ``environment`` data records information about the system and settings a session occurs in
* :doc:`events` can record richer data on individual occurrences of specific actions
* :doc:`Measuring elapsed time <measuring-time>`
* :doc:`Custom pings <custom-pings>`
* :doc:`Use counters <use-counters>` measure the usage of web platform features
* :doc:`Experiment annotations <experiments>`
* :doc:`Remote content uptake <uptake>`
* :doc:`WebExtension API <webextension-api>` can be used in privileged webextensions
* :doc:`Origin Telemetry <origin>` Experimental prototype. For use by Content Blocking only for now.
* :doc:`User Interactions <user-interactions>` allow annotating hang report pings with information on what the user was interacting with at the time
