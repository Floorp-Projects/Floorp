      Was the remote content successfully pulled?
      This uptake telemetry allows to monitor the behaviour of our clients when it comes
      to fetching data from remote servers. This helps defect-detection and allow observation of
      the proportion of success among clients and sources, the distribution of error causes, and
      its evolution over time.

        A label to distinguish what triggered the polling/fetching of remote content (eg. "broadcast",

      The fileinfo key may contain additional information about the file that caused the eval()

      shield.mozilla.org! to s! and mozilla.org! to m!.  Data, Blob, UserChromeJS, Other, and
      Regexfailure should have no value.
