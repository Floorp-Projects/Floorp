      This event is recorded only for Firefox UI documents (chrome).
      Recorded when a Yellow Screen of Death is shown. The `value` is a url on which the error happened.
      Yellow Screen of Death happens when XML or XHTML document encounters a parsing error. It is commonly a result
      of the document being malformed or missing DTD entity.
      Mozilla has a number of documents that rely on DTD entities for localization, and in some error scenarios those
      entities may be missing or malformed themselves, in which case the user will see a broken UI.
