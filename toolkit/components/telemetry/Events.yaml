      This uptake telemetry allows to monitor the behaviour of our clients when it comes
      to fetching data from remote servers. This helps defect-detection and allow observation of
      the proportion of success among clients and sources, the distribution of error causes, and
      its evolution over time.

      eval() (or an eval()-like method) was called while running in the System Principal
      context or the Parent Process.
      Expected values are:
        chromeuri - chrome:// file
        resourceuri - resource:// file
        singlestring - A single file or string with no slashes
        mozillaextension - An extension claiming to be from *mozilla.org

        suspectedUserChromeJS - A filepath ending in .uc.js
        other - Unknown
        regexfailure - Our Regex Matching code threw an error
      The fileinfo key may contain additional information about the file that caused the eval()
      depending on the above value. Resource, Chrome, and SingleString will contain the full value.
      Extensions will contain the full value; however .xpi! will be shortened to !,
      shield.mozilla.org! to s! and mozilla.org! to m!.  UserChromeJS, Other, and Regexfailure should
      have no value.
