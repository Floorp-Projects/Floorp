/**
 * Crash Monitor
 *
 * Monitors execution of a program to detect possible crashes. After
 * program termination, the monitor can be queried during the next run
 * to determine whether the last run exited cleanly or not.
 *
 * The monitoring is done by registering and listening for special
 * notifications, or checkpoints, known to be sent by the monitored
 * program as different stages in the execution are reached. As they
 * are observed, these notifications are written asynchronously to a
 * checkpoint file.
 *
 * During next program startup the crash monitor reads the checkpoint
 * file from the last session. If notifications are missing, a crash
 * has likely happened. By inspecting the notifications present, it is
 * possible to determine what stages were reached in the program
 * before the crash.
 *
 * Note that since the file is written asynchronously it is possible
 * that a received notification is lost if the program crashes right
 * after a checkpoint, but before crash monitor has been able to write
 * it to disk. Thus, while the presence of a notification in the
 * checkpoint file tells us that the corresponding stage was reached
 * during the last run, the absence of a notification after a crash
 * does not necessarily tell us that the checkpoint wasn't reached.
