//! An interface for managing and monitoring BITS jobs.
//!
//! BITS is a Windows service for performing downloads in the background, independent from an
//! application, usually via HTTP/HTTPS.
//!
//! [`BitsClient`](enum.BitsClient.html) is the main interface, used to issue commands.
//!
//! [`BitsMonitorClient`](enum.BitsMonitorClient.html) delivers periodic status reports about a
//! job.
//!
//! Microsoft's documentation for BITS can be found at
//! <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/Bits/background-intelligent-transfer-service-portal>
