  /**
   * A method to request that this provider provide a window.  The window
   * returned need not to have the right name or parent set on it; setting
   * those is the caller's responsibility.  The provider can always return null
   * to have the caller create a brand-new window.
   *
   * @param aOpenWindowInfo  Must not be null.  This is the information the
   *                         caller wants to be used to construct the new window.
   *
   * @param aChromeFlags The chrome flags the caller will use to create a new
   *        window if this provider returns null.  See nsIWebBrowserChrome for
   *        the possible values of this field.
   *
   * @param aURI The URI to be loaded in the new window (may be NULL).  The
   *        nsIWindowProvider implementation must not load this URI into the
   *        window it returns.  This URI is provided solely to help the
   *        nsIWindowProvider implementation make decisions; the caller will
   *        handle loading the URI in the window returned if provideWindow
   *        returns a window.
   *
   *        When making decisions based on aURI, note that even when it's not
   *        null, aURI may not represent all relevant information about the
   *        load.  For example, the load may have extra load flags, POST data,
   *        etc.
   *
   * @param aName The name of the window being opened.  Setting the name on the
   *        return value of provideWindow will be handled by the caller; aName
   *        is provided solely to help the nsIWindowProvider implementation
   *        make decisions.
   *
   * @param aFeatures The feature string for the window being opened.  This may
   *        be empty.  The nsIWindowProvider implementation is allowed to apply
   *        the feature string to the window it returns in any way it sees fit.
   *        See the nsIWindowWatcher interface for details on feature strings.
   *
   * @param aModifiers The modifiers associated with the user activation,
   *        or UserActivation::Modifiers::None() if this is not initiated by
   *        user activation. This is used to determine where the new window is
   *        located (e.g. new foreground tab, new background tab, new window).
   *
   * @param aIsPopupRequested  True if this window is opened by window.open
   *        with requesting a popup window.  This doesn't necessarily mean
   *        whether the actual window is shown as minimal popup or not.
   *
   * @param aLoadState Specify setup information of the load in the new window
   *
   * @param aWindowIsNew [out] Whether the window being returned was just
   *        created by the window provider implementation.  This can be used by
   *        callers to keep track of which windows were opened by the user as
   *        opposed to being opened programmatically.  This should be set to
   *        false if the window being returned existed before the
   *        provideWindow() call.  The value of this out parameter is
   *        meaningless if provideWindow() returns null.
   *
   * @return A window the caller should use or null if the caller should just
   *         create a new window.  The returned window may be newly opened by
   *         the nsIWindowProvider implementation or may be a window that
   *         already existed.
   *
   * @throw NS_ERROR_ABORT if the caller should cease its attempt to open a new
   *                       window.
   *
   * @see nsIWindowWatcher for more information on aFeatures.
   * @see nsIWebBrowserChrome for more information on aChromeFlags.
