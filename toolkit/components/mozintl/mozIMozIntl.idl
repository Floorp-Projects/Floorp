/**
 * This is a set of APIs that are of general usefulness for user interface
 * internationalization.
 *
 * They're all in various stages of the standardization process through
 * ECMA402, so they are exposed to privileged content only but are written
 * in the way to allow for easy migration to standard Intl object once
 * the appropriate stage of the ECMA402 is achieved.
 *
 * The exact structure of the code is a little bit complex because of that:
 *
 * 1) The core is in SpiderMonkey together with other Intl APIs
 *
 * This allows us to write the code once, stick to the spec language
 * of the proposal, reuse our ICU bindings in Spidermonkey and use
 * the code to inform us on refining the spec proposal for the given API itself.
 *
 * 2) The MozIntlHelper API exposes the SpiderMonkey APIs
 *
 * This helper API allows attaching the new APIs on any regular object.
 *
 * 3) The MozIntl API provides the access to those APIs
 *
 * This API exposes the actual functionality and wraps around the MozIntlHelper
 * lazily retrieving and setting the accessors.
 * On top of that, the API also binds additional functionality like using
 * current application locale by default, and fetching OS regional preferences
 * for date time format.
