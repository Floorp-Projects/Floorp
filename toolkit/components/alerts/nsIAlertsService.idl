    * Displays a sliding notification window.
    *
    * @param imageUrl       A URL identifying the image to put in the alert.
    * @param title          The title for the alert.
    * @param text           The contents of the alert.
    * @param textClickable  If true, causes the alert text to look like a link
    *                       and notifies the listener when user attempts to 
    *                       click the alert text.
    * @param cookie         A blind cookie the alert will pass back to the 
    *                       consumer during the alert listener callbacks.
    * @param alertListener  Used for callbacks. May be null if the caller 
    *                       doesn't care about callbacks.
    * @param name           The name of the notification. This is currently
    *                       only used on OS X with Growl and Android.
    *                       On OS X with Growl, users can disable notifications
    *                       with a given name. On Android the name is hashed
    *                       and used as a notification ID. Notifications will
    *                       replace previous notifications with the same name.
    * @param dir            Bidi override for the title. Valid values are
    *                       "auto", "ltr" or "rtl". Only available on supported
    *                       platforms.
    * @param lang           Language of title and text of the alert. Only available
    *                       on supported platforms.
    * @throws NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE If the notification cannot be displayed.
    *
    * The following arguments will be passed to the alertListener's observe() 
    * method:
    *   subject - null
    *   topic   - "alertfinished" when the alert goes away
    *             "alertclickcallback" when the text is clicked
    *             "alertshow" when the alert is shown
    *   data    - the value of the cookie parameter passed to showAlertNotification.
    *
    * @note Depending on current circumstances (if the user's in a fullscreen
    *       application, for instance), the alert might not be displayed at all.
    *       In that case, if an alert listener is passed in it will receive the
    *       "alertfinished" notification immediately.
