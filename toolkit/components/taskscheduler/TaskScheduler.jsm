/**
 * Interface to a system task scheduler, capable of running a command line at an interval
 * independent of the application.
 *
 * The expected consumer of this component wants to run a periodic short-lived maintenance task.
 * These periodic maintenance tasks will be per-OS-level user and run with the OS-level user's
 * permissions.  (These still need to work across systems with multiple users and the various
 * ownership and permission combinations that we see.)  This component does not help schedule
 * maintenance daemons, meaning long-lived processes.
 *
 * Currently only implemented for Windows and macOS, on other platforms these calls do nothing.
 *
 * The implementation will only interact with tasks from the same install of this application.
 * - On Windows the native tasks are named like "\<vendor>\<id> <install path hash>",
 *   e.g. "\Mozilla\Task Identifier 308046B0AF4A39CB"
 * - On macOS the native tasks are labeled like "<macOS bundle ID>.<install path hash>.<id>",
 *   e.g. "org.mozilla.nightly.308046B0AF4A39CB.Task Identifier".

  /**
   * Create a scheduled task that will run a command indepedent of the application.
   *
   * It will run every intervalSeconds seconds, starting intervalSeconds seconds from now.
   *
   * If the task is unable to run one or more scheduled times (e.g. if the computer is
   * off, or the owning user is not logged in), then the next time a run is possible the task
   * will be run once.
   *
   * An existing task with the same `id` will be replaced.
   *
   * Only one instance of the task will run at once, though this does not affect different
   * tasks from the same application.
   *
   * @param id
   *        A unique string (including a UUID is recommended) to distinguish the task among
   *        other tasks from this installation.
   *        This string will also be visible to system administrators, so it should be a legible
   *        description, but it does not need to be localized.
   *
   * @param command
   *        Full path to the executable to run.
   *
   * @param intervalSeconds
   *        Interval at which to run the command, in seconds. Minimum 1800 (30 minutes).
   *
   * @param options
   *        Optional, as are all of its properties:
   *        {
   *          args
   *            Array of arguments to pass on the command line. Does not include the command
   *            itself even if that is considered part of the command line. If missing, no
   *            argument list is generated.
   *
   *          workingDirectory
   *            Working directory for the command. If missing, no working directory is set.
   *
   *          description
   *            A description string that will be visible to system administrators. This should
   *            be localized. If missing, no description is set.
   *
   *          disabled
   *            If true the task will be created disabled, so that it will not be run.
   *            Ignored on macOS: see comments in TaskSchedulerMacOSImpl.jsm.
   *            Default false, intended for tests.
   *
   *          executionTimeoutSec
   *            Specifies how long (in seconds) the scheduled task can execute for before it is
   *            automatically stopped by the task scheduler. If a value <= 0 is given, it will be
   *            ignored.
   *            This is not currently implemented on macOS.
   *            On Windows, the default timeout is 72 hours.
   *        }
