<!-- We explicitly set the language to English, which more-or-less guarantees
     that the box-drawing characters used are the correct width. Without that,
     in a Japanese or Chinese locale we might end up with box-drawing
     characters that are twice the width of English characters, which messes up
     the tree layout. See bug 1561153 for details. Note that about:memory is
     not localized, so setting it explicitly to English should be fine.

     We also set the fonts in aboutMemory.css in such a way that maximizes the
     chances that the font chosen supports the box-drawing chars.
