/**
 * The nsIKeyValue* interfaces provide a simple, asynchronous API to a key/value
 * storage engine.  Basic put/get/has/delete operations are supported, as is
 * enumeration of key/value pairs and the use of multiple named databases within
 * a single storage file.  Operations have ACID semantics.
 *
 * This API does not (yet) support transactions, so it will not be appropriate
 * for all use cases.  Extension of this API to support transactions is tracked
 * by bug 1499238.
 *
 * The kvstore.jsm module wraps this API in a more idiomatic, Promise-based
 * JS API that supports async/await.  In most cases, you're better off using
 * that API from JS rather than using this one directly.  Bug 1512319 tracks
 * native support for Promise in Rust-implemented XPCOM methods.
