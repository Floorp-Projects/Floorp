# The syscall number is passed through r7 in the linux ARM ABI, but r7

# complains if we store to r7, not unreasonably, but complains
# inconsistently.  The generic syscall template pushes/stores to/pops
# r7 with no complaint from gcc, but the sys_clone() function marks r7
# as a clobbered register yet gcc error's.  The generated assembly for
# sys_clone() looks OK, so we chalk this up to a gcc/gas quirk and
# work around it by telling gcc that the THUMB frame pointer is a
# vanilla callee-save register.
