# Gecko typelibs

This directory contains generated TypeScript declarations for types and components
exposed to js on the Gecko platform. The files are generated
from various sources in the tree using tools/ts/build_*.js scripts.

If you're modifying some of the interfaces or other source files, until we
find the best way to integrate this process, updating the typelibs is optional.
If you want to see the result of your changes right away, you can run:

    mach ts build && mach ts update

This will update the typelibs inside your source tree, and you can commit
them alongside your changes. Because this step is not automated, it's likely
it will pick up previous updates unrelated to your patch, in which case it
might be worth splitting out into a separate commit.

There are also other ``mach ts`` commands for generating the files not updated
with the command above.

If there's an error with the process, updating the typelibs is not a blocker
for landing your patch, but please file a bug in the Linting and Formatting
component and ni?zombie.
