# Building XPIDLs effectively consists of two steps:
#
#   1) Staging all .idl files to a common directory.
#   2) Doing everything with the .idl files.
#
# Each .idl file is processed into a .h file and typelib information.
# The .h file shares the same stem as the input file and is installed
# in the common headers include directory.
#
# XPIDL files are logically grouped together by modules. The typelib
# information for all XPIDLs in the same module is linked together into
# an .xpt file having the name of the module.
#
# As an optimization to reduce overall CPU usage, we process all .idl
# belonging to a module with a single command invocation. This prevents
# redundant parsing of .idl files and significantly reduces CPU cycles.

# For dependency files.
