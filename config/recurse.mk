# The traditional model of directory traversal with make is as follows:
#   make -C foo
#     Entering foo
#     make -C bar
#       Entering foo/bar
#     make -C baz
#       Entering foo/baz
#   make -C qux

#
# Pseudo derecurse transforms the above into:
#   make -C foo
#   make -C foo/bar
#   make -C foo/baz
#   make -C qux
