# The traditional Mozilla build system relied on going through the entire
# build tree a number of times with different targets, and many of the
# things happening at each step required other things happening in previous
# steps without any documentation of those dependencies.
#
# This new build system tries to start afresh by establishing what files or
# operations are needed for the build, and applying the necessary rules to
# have those in place, relying on make dependencies to get them going.
#
# As of writing, only building non-compiled parts of Firefox is supported
# here (a few other things are also left out). This is a starting point, with
# the intent to grow this build system to make it more complete.
#
# This file contains rules and dependencies to get things working. The intent
# is for a Makefile to define some dependencies and variables, and include
# this file. What needs to be defined there, and ends up being generated by
# python/mozbuild/mozbuild/backend/fastermake.py is the following:
# - TOPSRCDIR/TOPOBJDIR, respectively the top source directory and the top
#   object directory
# - PYTHON, the path to the python executable
# - ACDEFINES, which contains a set of -Dvar=name to be used during
#   preprocessing
# - MOZ_CHROME_FILE_FORMAT, which defines whether to use file copies or
#   symbolic links
# - JAR_MN_TARGETS, which defines the targets to use for jar manifest
#   processing, see further below
# - PP_TARGETS, which defines the file paths of preprocessed files, see
#   further below
# - INSTALL_MANIFESTS, which defines the list of base directories handled
#   by install manifests, see further below
# - MANIFEST_TARGETS, which defines the file paths of chrome manifests, see
#   further below
#
# A convention used between this file and the Makefile including it is that
# global Make variables names are uppercase, while "local" Make variables
# applied to specific targets are lowercase.

# The list of preprocessed files is defined in PP_TARGETS. The list is

# The source file for each of those preprocessed files is defined as a Make

#   PP_TARGETS = foo/bar
#   $(TOPOBJDIR)/foo/bar: /path/to/source/for/foo/bar.in
# The file name for the source doesn't need to be different.
# Additionally, extra defines can be specified for a given preprocessing
# by setting the `defines` variable specifically for the given target.
# For example:
#   $(TOPOBJDIR)/foo/bar: defines = -Dqux=foobar

# Install files from jar manifests. Ideally, they would be using install

#
# The list given in JAR_MN_TARGETS corresponds to the list of `jar-%` targets
# to be processed, with the `jar-` prefix stripped.
# The Makefile is expected to specify the source jar manifest as a dependency
# to each target. There is no expectation that the `jar-%` target name matches
# the source file name in any way. For example:
#   JAR_MN_TARGETS = foo
#   jar-foo: /path/to/some/jar.mn
# Additionally, extra defines can be specified for the processing of the jar
# manifest by settig the `defines` variable specifically for the given target.
# For example:
#   jar-foo: defines = -Dqux=foo
# The default base path where files are going to be installed is `dist/bin`.
# It is possible to use a different path by setting the `install_target`
# variable. For example:
#   jar-foo: install_target = dist/bin/foo
# When processing jar manifests, relative paths given inside a jar manifest
# can be resolved from an object directory. The default path for that object
# directory is the translation of the jar manifest directory path from the
# source directory to the object directory. That is, for
# $(TOPSRCDIR)/path/to/jar.mn, the default would be $(TOPOBJDIR)/path/to.
# In case a different path must be used for the object directory, the `objdir`
# variable can be set. For example:
#   jar-foo: objdir=/some/other/path
