# The traditional Mozilla build system relied on going through the entire
# build tree a number of times with different targets, and many of the
# things happening at each step required other things happening in previous
# steps without any documentation of those dependencies.
#
# This new build system tries to start afresh by establishing what files or
# operations are needed for the build, and applying the necessary rules to
# have those in place, relying on make dependencies to get them going.
#
# As of writing, only building non-compiled parts of Firefox is supported
# here (a few other things are also left out). This is a starting point, with
# the intent to grow this build system to make it more complete.
#
# This file contains rules and dependencies to get things working. The intent
# is for a Makefile to define some dependencies and variables, and include
# this file. What needs to be defined there, and ends up being generated by
# python/mozbuild/mozbuild/backend/fastermake.py is the following:
# - TOPSRCDIR/TOPOBJDIR, respectively the top source directory and the top
#   object directory
# - PYTHON, the path to the python executable
# - ACDEFINES, which contains a set of -Dvar=name to be used during
#   preprocessing
# - INSTALL_MANIFESTS, which defines the list of base directories handled
#   by install manifests, see further below
#
# A convention used between this file and the Makefile including it is that
# global Make variables names are uppercase, while "local" Make variables
# applied to specific targets are lowercase.

# Targets to be triggered for a default build
default: $(addprefix install-,$(INSTALL_MANIFESTS))
