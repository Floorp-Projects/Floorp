"""
Test case infrastructure for MozZipFile.

This isn't really a unit test, but a test case generator and runner.
For a given set of files, lengths, and number of writes, we create
a testcase for every combination of the three. There are some
symmetries used to reduce the number of test cases, the first file
written is always the first file, the second is either the first or
the second, the third is one of the first three. That is, if we
had 4 files, but only three writes, the fourth file would never even
get tried.

The content written to the jars is pseudorandom with a fixed seed.
