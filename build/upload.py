# UPLOAD_PATH    : path on that host to put the files in
#
# Files are simply copied to UPLOAD_PATH.
#
# All files to be uploaded should be passed as commandline arguments to this
# script. The script takes one other parameter, --base-path, which you can use
# to indicate that files should be uploaded including their paths relative
# to the base path.
