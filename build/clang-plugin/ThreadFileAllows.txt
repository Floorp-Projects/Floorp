# This file is ingested by `ThreadAllows.py` to produce a list of files which
# our clang plugin will allow to use `NS_NewNamedThread`.
#
# Files may be specified with any number of slash-separated path-elements; all
# provided path-elements must match. (Because we often move and/or symlink
# header files, this means headers will usually have no path-elements.)
#
# Note that this file contains a list of _files_, not _paths_. The clang plugin
# has no notion of $TOPSRCDIR.
