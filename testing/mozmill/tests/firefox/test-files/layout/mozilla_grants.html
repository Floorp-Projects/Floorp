        <h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>
        <p id="summary">
            Since 2006, Mozilla has awarded over two million dollars to fund 
            projects that contribute to the health of the Open Web. The 
            Mozilla Grants program is jointly funded by the Mozilla 
            Corporation and the Mozilla Foundation, and awards financial 
            support to individuals and organizations whose work supports and 
            enhances the mission and values of the Mozilla Project.        
        </p>

        <h2><a name="goals">Goals</a></h2>
        <p id="goals">
            Mozilla makes grants to individuals and organizations all over 
            the world. We mainly fund activity that supports the Mozilla 
            Grants program's four target areas:

            <ul id="goal_list">
                <li id="accessibility">
                    <strong>Accessibility:</strong> Mozilla believes that 
                    the Internet truly is for everyone, and that those with 
                    disabilities should be able to participate on the Web 
                    along with their sighted and hearing peers. As part of 
                    our accessibility strategy, we are funding the 
                    development of free, open source options for those with 
                    visual and auditory impairments.
                </li>
                
                <li id="community">
                    <strong>Community:</strong> Mozilla offers suppport to 
                    the broader free culture and open source community, as 
                    part of Mozilla's general effort to 'give back', aiding 
                    in the creation of technologies and projects that 
                    increase the health of the open Web ecosystem.
                </li>
                
                <li id="education">
                    <strong>Education:</strong> As part of Mozilla's broader 
                    education initiative, we support educational 
                    institutions that are producing the next generation of 
                    innovative creators of software.
                </li>
                
                <li id="open_source">
                    <strong>Open Source:</strong> These grants support the 
                    creation and adoption of Web standards, open source 
                    principles, and the overall principles of transparency, 
                    collaboration, and openness that free and open source 
                    software projects adhere to.
