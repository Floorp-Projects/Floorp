            Mozilla's mission is to <strong>promote openness, innovation, 
            and opportunity on the web</strong>. We do this by creating 
            great software, like the Firefox browser, and building 
            movements, like Drumbeat, that give people tools to take control 
            of their online lives.

        <p id="organization">
            As a non-profit organization, we define success in terms of 
            building communities and enriching people's lives instead of 
            benefiting our shareholders (guess what: we don't even have 
            shareholders). We believe in the power and potential of the 
            Internet and want to see it thrive for everyone, everywhere.
        </p>

        <p id="goal">
            <strong>
                Building a better Internet is an ambitious goal, but we 
                believe that it is possible
            </strong> 
            when people who share our passion get involved. Coders, artists, 
            writers, testers, surfers, students, grandparents; anyone who 
            uses and cares about the web can help make it even better.
