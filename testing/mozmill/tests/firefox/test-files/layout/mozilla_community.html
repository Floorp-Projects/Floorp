        <h2><a name="history">History</a></h2>
        <p id="history">
            When www.mozilla.org was launched in 1998 all community activity 
            occurred right here on this site.  Since then the community has 
            grown much bigger and there are now many different sites, 
            forums, blogs and newsgroups in different places that track 
            different parts of the project.  These pages aim to be a 
            comprehensive list to all of the different community resources 
            available.  If you know of something that's not on these lists 
            that should be, please contact us and we'll update these 
            pages.
        </p>

        <h2><a name="communicate">Communicate</a></h2>
        <p id="communicate">
            There are a number of different ways community members 
            communicate and coordinate (people use mailing lists and 
            newsgroups, blogs, forums, wikis and they even meet in real
            life sometimes too) and all of these options might be 
            overwhelming at first.  Hopefully this set of links will provide 
            some useful pointers to help you figure out where to go to find 
            what you're looking for.  If you do get lost though and need 
            some help, feel free to ask for more information.
