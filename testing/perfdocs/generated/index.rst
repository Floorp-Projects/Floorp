Performance Testing
###################

Performance tests are designed to catch performance regressions before they reach our
end users. At this time, there is no unified approach for these types of tests,
but `mozperftest </testing/perfdocs/mozperftest.html>`_ aims to provide this in the future.

For more detailed information about each test suite, see each projects' documentation:

  * :doc:`DAMP`
  * :doc:`awsy`
  * :doc:`fxrecord`
  * :doc:`mozperftest`
  * :doc:`raptor`
  * :doc:`talos`
