Talos
=====

Talos is a cross-platform Python performance testing framework that is specifically for
Firefox on desktop. New performance tests should be added to the newer framework
`mozperftest </testing/perfdocs/mozperftest.html>`_ unless there are limitations
there (highly unlikely) that make it absolutely necessary to add them to Talos. Talos is
named after the `bronze automaton from Greek myth <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talos>`_.

Talos tests are run in a similar manner to xpcshell and mochitests. They are started via
the command :code:`mach talos-test`. A `python script <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/talos>`_
then launches Firefox, which runs the tests via JavaScript special powers. The test timing
information is recorded in a text log file, e.g. :code:`browser_output.txt`, and then processed
into the `JSON format supported by Perfherder <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/mozharness/external_tools/performance-artifact-schema.json>`_.

Talos bugs can be filed in `Testing::Talos <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Testing&component=Talos>`_.

Talos infrastructure is still mostly documented `on the Mozilla Wiki <https://wiki.mozilla.org/TestEngineering/Performance/Talos>`_.
In addition, there are plans to surface all of the individual tests using PerfDocs.
This work is tracked in `Bug 1674220 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1674220>`_.

Examples of current Talos runs can be `found in Treeherder by searching for "Talos" <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/jobs?repo=autoland&searchStr=Talos>`_.
If none are immediately available, then scroll to the bottom of the page and load more test
runs. The tests all share a group symbol starting with a :code:`T`, for example
:code:`T(c d damp g1)` or :code:`T-gli(webgl)`.

Running Talos Locally
*********************

Running tests locally is most likely only useful for debugging what is going on in a test,
as the test output is only reported as raw JSON. The CLI is documented via:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./mach talos-test --help

To quickly try out the :code:`./mach talos-test` command, the following can be run to do a
single run of the DevTools' simple netmonitor test.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Run the "simple.netmonitor" test very quickly with 1 cycle, and 1 page cycle.
    ./mach talos-test --activeTests damp --subtests simple.netmonitor --cycles 1 --tppagecycles 1


The :code:`--print-suites` and :code:`--print-tests` are two helpful command flags to
figure out what suites and tests are available to run.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Print out the suites:
    ./mach talos-test --print-suites

    # Available suites:
    #  bcv                          (basic_compositor_video)
    #  chromez                      (about_preferences_basic:tresize)
    #  dromaeojs                    (dromaeo_css:kraken)
    #  flex                         (tart_flex:ts_paint_flex)
    # ...

    # Run all of the tests in the "bcv" test suite:
    ./mach talos-test --suite bcv

    # Print out the tests:
    ./mach talos-test --print-tests

    # Available tests:
    # ================
    #
    # a11yr
    # -----
    # This test ensures basic a11y tables and permutations do not cause
    # performance regressions.
    #
    # ...

    # Run the tests in "a11yr" listed above
    ./mach talos-test --activeTests a11yr

Running Talos on Try
********************

Talos runs can be generated through the mach try fuzzy finder:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./mach try fuzzy

The following is an example output at the time of this writing. Refine the query for the
platform and test suites of your choosing.

.. code-block::

-  Taskcluster schedules `talos
   jobs <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/taskcluster/ci/test/talos.yml>`__
-  Taskcluster runs a Talos job on a hardware machine when one is
   available - this is bootstrapped by
   `mozharness <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/mozharness/mozharness/mozilla/testing/talos.py>`__

   -  mozharness downloads the build, talos.zip (found in
      `talos.json <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/talos/talos.json>`__),
      and creates a virtualenv for running the test.
   -  mozharness `configures the test and runs
      it <https://wiki.mozilla.org/TestEngineering/Performance/Talos/Running#How_Talos_is_Run_in_Production>`__
   -  After the test is completed the data is uploaded to
      `Perfherder <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/perf.html#/graphs>`__

-  Treeherder displays a green (all OK) status and has a link to
   `Perfherder <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/perf.html#/graphs>`__
-  13 pushes later,
   `analyze_talos.py <http://hg.mozilla.org/graphs/file/tip/server/analysis/analyze_talos.py>`__

Test types
**********

There are two different species of Talos tests:

-  Startup_: Start up the browser and wait for either the load event or the paint event and exit, measuring the time
-  `Page load`_: Load a manifest of pages

In addition we have some variations on existing tests:

-  Heavy_: Run tests with the heavy user profile instead of a blank one
-  `Web extension`_: Run tests with a web extension to see the perf impact extension have
-  `Real-world WebExtensions`_: Run tests with a set of 5 popular real-world WebExtensions installed and enabled.

Some tests measure different things:

-  Paint_: These measure events from the browser like moz_after_paint, etc.
-  ASAP_: These tests go really fast and typically measure how many frames we can render in a time window
-  Benchmarks_: These are benchmarks that measure specific items and report a summarized score

Startup
=======

`Startup
tests <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/talos/talos/startup_test>`__
launch Firefox and measure the time to the onload or paint events. We
run this in a series of cycles (default to 20) to generate a full set of
data. Tests that currently are startup tests are:

-  `ts_paint <#ts_paint>`_
-  tpaint_
-  `tresize <#tresize>`_
-  `sessionrestore <#sessionrestore>`_
-  `sessionrestore_no_auto_restore <#sessionrestore_no_auto_restore>`_
-  `sessionrestore_many_windows <#sessionrestore_many_windows>`_

Page load
=========

Many of the talos tests use the page loader to load a manifest of pages.
These are tests that load a specific page and measure the time it takes
to load the page, scroll the page, draw the page etc. In order to run a
page load test, you need a manifest of pages to run. The manifest is
simply a list of URLs of pages to load, separated by carriage returns,
e.g.:

.. code-block:: none

   https://www.mozilla.org
   https://www.mozilla.com

Example:
`svgx.manifest <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/talos/talos/tests/svgx/svgx.manifest>`__

Manifests may also specify that a test computes its own data by
prepending a ``%`` in front of the line:

.. code-block:: none

   % https://www.mozilla.org
   % https://www.mozilla.com

Example:
`v8.manifest <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/talos/talos/tests/v8_7/v8.manifest>`__

The file you created should be referenced in your test config inside of
`test.py <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/talos/talos/test.py#l607>`__.
For example, open test.py, and look for the line referring to the test
you want to run:

.. code-block:: python

   tpmanifest = '${talos}/page_load_test/svgx/svgx.manifest'
   tpcycles = 1 # run a single cycle
   tppagecycles = 25 # load each page 25 times before moving onto the next page

Heavy
=====

All our testing is done with empty blank profiles, this is not ideal for
finding issues for end users. We recently undertook a task to create a
daily update to a profile so it is modern and relevant. It browses a
variety of web pages, and have history and cache to give us a more
realistic scenario.

The toolchain is documented on
`github <https://github.com/tarekziade/heavy-profile>`__ and was added
to Talos in `bug
1407398 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1407398>`__.

Currently we have issues with this on windows (takes too long to unpack
the files from the profile), so we have turned this off there. Our goal
is to run this on basic pageload and startup tests.

Web extension
=============

Web Extensions are what Firefox has switched to and there are different
code paths and APIs used vs addons. Historically we don't test with
addons (other than our test addons) and are missing out on common
slowdowns. In 2017 we started running some startup and basic pageload
tests with a web extension in the profile (`bug
1398974 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1398974>`__). We
have updated the Extension to be more real world and will continue to do
that.

Real-world WebExtensions
========================

We've added a variation on our test suite that automatically downloads,
installs and enables 5 popular WebExtensions. This is used to measure
things like the impact of real-world WebExtensions on start-up time.

Currently, the following extensions are installed:

-  Adblock Plus (3.5.2)
-  Cisco Webex Extension (1.4.0)
-  Easy Screenshot (3.67)
-  NoScript (10.6.3)
-  Video DownloadHelper (7.3.6)

Note that these add-ons and versions are "pinned" by being held in a
compressed file that's hosted in an archive by our test infrastructure
and downloaded at test runtime. To update the add-ons in this set, one
must provide a new ZIP file to someone on the test automation team. See
`this comment in
Bugzilla <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1575089#c3>`__.

Paint
=====

Paint tests are measuring the time to receive both the
`MozAfterPaint <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/MozAfterPaint>`__
and OnLoad event instead of just the OnLoad event. Most tests now look
for this unless they are an ASAP test, or an internal benchmark

ASAP
====

We have a variety of tests which we now run in ASAP mode where we render
as fast as possible (disabling vsync and letting the rendering iterate
as fast as it can using \`requestAnimationFrame`). In fact we have
replaced some original tests with the 'x' versions to make them measure.
We do this with RequestAnimationFrame().

ASAP tests are:

-  `basic_compositor_video <#basic_compositor_video>`_
-  `displaylist_mutate <#displaylist_mutate>`_
-  `glterrain <#glterrain>`_
-  `rasterflood_svg <#rasterflood_svg>`_
-  `rasterflood_gradient <#rasterflood_gradient>`_
-  `tsvgx <#tsvgx>`_
-  `tscrollx <#tscrollx>`_
-  `tp5o_scroll <#tp5o_scroll>`_
-  `tabswitch <#tabswitch>`_
-  `tart <#tart>`_

Benchmarks
==========

Many tests have internal benchmarks which we report as accurately as
possible. These are the exceptions to the general rule of calculating
the suite score as a geometric mean of the subtest values (which are
median values of the raw data from the subtests).

Tests which are imported benchmarks are:

-  `ARES6 <#ARES6>`_
-  `dromaeo <#dromaeo>`_
-  `JetStream <#JetStream>`_
-  `kraken <#kraken>`_
-  `motionmark <#motionmark>`_
-  `stylebench <#stylebench>`_

Row major vs. column major
==========================

To get more stable numbers, tests are run multiple times. There are two
ways that we do this: row major and column major. Row major means each
test is run multiple times and then we move to the next test (and run it
multiple times). Column major means that each test is run once one after
the other and then the whole sequence of tests is run again.

More background information about these approaches can be found in Joel
Maher's `Reducing the Noise in
Talos <https://elvis314.wordpress.com/2012/03/12/reducing-the-noise-in-talos/>`__
blog post.

Page sets
*********

We run our tests 100% offline, but serve pages via a webserver. Knowing
this we need to store and make available the offline pages we use for
testing.

tp5pages
========

Some tests make use of a set of 50 "real world" pages, known as the tp5n
set. These pages are not part of the talos repository, but without them
the tests which use them won't run.

-  To add these pages to your local setup, download the latest tp5n zip
   from `tooltool <https://mozilla-releng.net/tooltool/>`__, and extract
   it such that ``tp5n`` ends up as ``testing/talos/talos/tests/tp5n``.
   You can also obtain it by running a talos test locally to get the zip
   into ``testing/talos/talos/tests/``, i.e ``./mach talos-test --suite damp``
-  see also `tp5o <#tp5o>`_.

   * description:
    This test measures the performance of the Firefox about:preferences
    page. This test is a little different than other pageload tests in that
    we are loading one page (about:preferences) but also testing the loading
    of that same page's subcategories/panels (i.e. about:preferences#home).

    When simply changing the page's panel/category, that doesn't cause a new
    onload event as expected; therefore we had to introduce loading the
    'about:blank' page in between each page category; that forces the entire
    page to reload with the specified category panel activated.

    For that reason, when new panels/categories are added to the
    'about:preferences' page, it can be expected that a performance
    regression may be introduced, even if a subtest hasn't been added for
    that new page category yet.

    This test should only ever have 1 pagecycle consisting of the main
    about-preferences page and each category separated by an about:blank
    between. Then repeats are achieved by using 25 cycles (instead of
    pagecycles).

   * description:
    This measures the amount of time it takes to render a page after
    changing its display list. The page has a large number of display list
    items (10,000), and mutates one every frame. The goal of the test is to
    make displaylist construction a bottleneck, rather than painting or
    other factors, and thus improvements or regressions to displaylist
    construction will be visible. The test runs in ASAP mode to maximize
    framerate, and the result is how quickly the test was able to mutate and
    re-paint 600 items, one during each frame.

   * description:
    Dromaeo suite of tests for JavaScript performance testing. See the
    `Dromaeo wiki <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Dromaeo>`__ for more
    information.

    This suite is divided into several sub-suites.

    Each sub-suite is divided into tests, and each test is divided into
    sub-tests. Each sub-test takes some (in theory) fixed piece of work and
    measures how many times that piece of work can be performed in one
    second. The score for a test is then the geometric mean of the
    runs/second numbers for its sub-tests. The score for a sub-suite is the
    geometric mean of the scores for its tests.

   * summarization:
      * subtest:
        Dromaeo is a custom benchmark which has a lot of micro tests
        inside each subtest, because of this we use a custom `dromaeo
        filter <https://wiki.mozilla.org/TestEngineering/Performance/Talos/Data#dromaeo>`__
        to summarize the subtest. Each micro test produces 5 data points and
        for each 5 data points we take the mean, leaving 36 data points to
        represent the subtest (assuming 180 points). These 36 micro test
        means, are then run through a geometric_mean to produce a single
        number for the dromaeo subtest. `source:
        filter.py <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/talos/talos/test.py#l527>`__
      * suite: `geometric mean`_ of the 6 subtest results.
   * description:
    Each page in the manifest is part of the dromaeo css benchmark. Each
    page measures the performance of searching the DOM for nodes matching
    various CSS selectors, using different libraries for the selector
    implementation (jQuery, Dojo, Mootools, ExtJS, Prototype, and Yahoo UI).

   * type: `Page load`_
   * data: see Dromaeo DOM
   * reporting: speed in test runs per second (higher is better)
   * description:
    Each page in the manifest is part of the dromaeo dom benchmark. These
    are the specific areas that Dromaeo DOM covers:
      * **DOM Attributes**:
        Measures performance of getting and setting a DOM attribute, both via
        ``getAttribute`` and via a reflecting DOM property. Also throws in some
        expando getting/setting for good measure.
      * **DOM Modification**:
        Measures performance of various things that modify the DOM tree:
        creating element and text nodes and inserting them into the DOM.
      * **DOM Query**:
        Measures performance of various methods of looking for nodes in the DOM:
        ``getElementById``, ``getElementsByTagName``, and so forth.
      * **DOM Traversal**:
        Measures performance of various accessors (``childNodes``,
        ``firstChild``, etc) that would be used when doing a walk over the DOM
        tree.

    Please see `dromaeo_css <#dromaeo_css>`_ for examples of data.

    This tests animates a simple WebGL scene (static textured landscape, one
    moving light source, rotating viewport) and measure the frames
    throughput (expressed as average interval) over 100 frames. It runs in
    ASAP mode (vsync off) and measures the same scene 4 times (for all
    combination of antialiasing and alpha. It reports the results as 4
    values) one for each combination. Lower results are better.

    This test playbacks a video file and ask WebGL to draw video frames as
    WebGL textures for 100 ticks. It collects the mean tick time across 100
    ticks to measure how much time it will spend for a video texture upload
    to be a WebGL texture (gl.texImage2D). We run it for 5 times and ignore
    the first found. Lower results are better.

    **Important note:** This test now requires an 'opt' build. If the
    perf-reftest is ran on a non-opt build, it will time out (more
    specifically on innertext-1.html, and possibly others in the future).

    Style system performance test suite. The perf-reftest suite is a unique
    talos suite where each subtest loads two different test pages: a 'base'
    page (i.e. bloom_basic) and a 'reference' page (i.e. bloom_basic_ref),
    and then compares each of the page load times against eachother to
    determine the variance.

    Talos runs each of the two pages as if they are stand-alone tests, and
    then calculates and reports the variance; the test output 'replicates'
    reported from bloom_basic are actually the comparisons between the
    'base' and 'reference' pages for each page load cycle. The suite
    contains multiple subtests, each of which contains a base page and a
    reference page.

    If you wish to see the individual 'base' and 'reference' page results
    instead of just the reported difference, the 'base_replicates' and
    'ref_replicates' can be found in the PERFHERDER_DATA log file output,
    and in the 'local.json' talos output file when running talos locally. In
    production, both of the page replicates are also archived in the
    perfherder-data.json file. The perfherder-data.json file is archived
    after each run in production, and can be found on the Treeherder Job
    Details tab when the perf-reftest job symbol is selected.

    This test suite was ported over from the `style-perf-tests <https://github.com/heycam/style-perf-tests>`__.

    This page animates some complex gradient patterns in a
    requestAnimationFrame callback. However, it also churns the CPU during
    each callback, spinning an empty loop for 14ms each frame. The intent is
    that, if we consider the rasterization costs to be 0, then the animation
    should run close to 60fps. Otherwise it will lag. Since rasterization
    costs are not 0, the lower we can get them, the faster the test will
    run. The test runs in ASAP mode to maximize framerate.

    The test runs for 10 seconds, and the resulting score is how many frames
    we were able to render during that time. Higher is better. Improvements
    (or regressions) to general painting performance or gradient rendering
    will affect this benchmark.

   * description:
    This page animates some complex SVG patterns in a requestAnimationFrame
    callback. However, it also churns the CPU during each callback, spinning
    an empty loop for 14ms each frame. The intent is that, if we consider
    the rasterization costs to be 0, then the animation should run close to
    60fps. Otherwise it will lag. Since rasterization costs are not 0, the
    lower we can get them, the faster the test will run. The test runs in
    ASAP mode to maximize framerate. The result is how quickly the browser
    is able to render 600 frames of the animation.

    Improvements (or regressions) to general painting performance or SVG are
    likely to affect this benchmark.

   * description:
    Three tests measure the time spent reading and restoring the session
    from a valid sessionstore.js. Time is counted from the *process start*
    until the *sessionRestored* event.

    In *sessionrestore*, this is tested with a configuration that requires
    the session to be restored. In *sessionrestore_no_auto_restore*, this is
    tested with a configuration that requires the session to not be
    restored. Both of the above tests use a sessionstore.js file that
    contains one window and roughly 89 tabs. In
    *sessionrestore_many_windows*, this is tested with a sessionstore.js
    that contains 3 windows and 130 tabs. The first window contains 50 tabs,
    80 remaning tabs are divided equally between the second and the third
    window.

   * source: `tart <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/talos/talos/tests/tart>`__
   * type: `Page load`_
   * measuring: Desktop Firefox UI animation speed and smoothness
   * reporting: intervals in ms (lower is better)
   * see below for details
   * data: there are 30 reported subtests from TART which we load 25 times, resulting in 30 sets of 25 data points.
   * summarization:
      * subtest: `ignore first`_ data point, then take the `median`_ of the remaining 24 data points; `source:
        test.py <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/talos/talos/test.py#l305>`__
      * suite: `geometric mean`_ of the 30 subtest results.
   * TART is the **Tab Animation Regression Test**.
   * TART tests tab animation on these cases:
   * Simple: single new tab of about:blank open/close without affecting (shrinking/expanding) other tabs.
   * icon: same as above with favicons and long title instead of about:blank.
   * Newtab: newtab open with thumbnails preview
   * without affecting other tabs, with and without preload.
   * Fade: opens a tab, then measures fadeout/fadein (tab animation without the overhead of opening/closing a tab).
      * Case 1 is tested with DPI scaling of 1.
      * Case 2 is tested with DPI scaling of 1.0 and 2.0.
      * Case 3 is tested with the default scaling of the test system.
      * Case 4 is tested with DPI scaling of 2.0 with the "icon" tab (favicon and long title).
   * Each animation produces 3 test results:
      * error: difference between the designated duration and the actual completion duration from the trigger.
      * half: average frame interval over the 2nd half of the animation.
      * all: average frame interval over all recorded intervals.
      * And the run logs also include the explicit intervals from which these 3 values were derived.

   * contact: :davehunt, and perftest team
   * source: `tp5n.zip <#page-sets>`__
   * type: `Page load`_
   * data: we load each of the 51 tp5o pages 25 times, resulting in 51 sets of 25 data points.
   * **To run it locally**, you'd need `tp5n.zip <#page-sets>`__.
   * summarization: tp5 with limited pageset (48 pages as others have too much noise)
      * subtest: `ignore first`_ **5** data points, then take the `median`_ of the remaining 20; `source:
        test.py <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/talos/talos/test.py#l449>`__
      * suite: `geometric mean`_ of the 51 subtest results.
   * description:
    Tests the time it takes Firefox to load the `tp5 web page test
    set <#page-sets>`__. The web set was culled from the Alexa top 500 April
    8th, 2011 and consists of 100 pages in tp5n and 51 in tp5o. Some suites
    use a subset of these, i.e. 48/51 tests to reduce noise
   * check with the
    owner of the test suite which uses the pageset to check if this
    difference exists there.

    Here are the broad steps we use to create the test set:

    #. Take the Alexa top 500 sites list
    #. Remove all sites with questionable or explicit content
    #. Remove duplicate site (for ex. many Google search front pages)
    #. Manually select to keep interesting pages (such as pages in different
    locales)
    #. Select a more representative page from any site presenting a simple
    search/login/etc. page
    #. Deal with Windows 255 char limit for cached pages
    #. Limit test set to top 100 pages

    Note that the above steps did not eliminate all outside network access
    so we had to take further action to scrub all the pages so that there
    are 0 outside network accesses (this is done so that the tp test is as
    deterministic measurement of our rendering/layout/paint process as
    possible).

.. dropdown:: tp5o_scroll

   * contact: :botond, :tnikkel, :hiro, and layout team
   * source: `tp5n.zip <#page-sets>`__
   * type: `Page load`_
   * data: we load each of the 51 tp5o pages 12 times, resulting in 51 sets of 12 data points.
   * **To run it locally**, you'd need `tp5n.zip <#page-sets>`__.
   * summarization: Measures average frames interval while scrolling the pages of the tp5o set
      * subtest: `ignore first`_ data point, then take the `median`_ of the remaining 11; `source:
        test.py <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/talos/talos/test.py#l470>`__
      * suite: `geometric mean`_ of the 51 subtest results.
   * description:
    This test is identical to tscrollx, but it scrolls the 50 pages of the
    tp5o set (rather than 6 synthetic pages which tscrollx scrolls). There
    are two variants for each test page. The "regular" variant waits 500ms
    after the page load event fires, then iterates 100 scroll steps of 10px
    each (or until the bottom of the page is reached
   * whichever comes
    first), then reports the average frame interval. The "CSSOM" variant is
    similar, but uses APZ's smooth scrolling mechanism to do compositor
    scrolling instead of main-thread scrolling. So it just requests the
    final scroll destination and the compositor handles the scrolling and
    reports frame intervals.

   * **Possible regression causes**: Some examples of things that cause regressions in this test are
      * Increased displayport size (which causes a larger display list to be built)
      * Slowdown in the building of display list
      * Slowdown in rasterization of content
      * Slowdown in composite times

   * data: we run the tresize test page 20 times, resulting in 1 set of 20 data points.
   * summarization:
      * subtest: `ignore first`_ **5** data points, then take the `median`_ of the remaining 15 data points; `source:

      * suite: same as subtest result
   * description:
    A purer form of paint measurement than tpaint. This test opens a single
    window positioned at 10,10 and sized to 300,300, then resizes the window
    outward \|max\| times measuring the amount of time it takes to repaint
    each resize. Dumps the resulting dataset and average to stdout or
    logfile.

    In `bug
    1102479 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1102479>`__
    tresize was rewritten to work in e10s mode which involved a full rewrite
    of the test.

    This test scrolls several pages where each represent a different known
    "hard" case to scroll (\* needinfo), and measures the average frames
    interval (1/FPS) on each. The ASAP test (tscrollx) iterates in unlimited
    frame-rate mode thus reflecting the maximum scroll throughput per page.
    To turn on ASAP mode, we set these preferences:

    ``preferences = {'layout.frame_rate': 0, 'docshell.event_starvation_delay_hint': 1}``

    See also `tp5o_scroll <#tp5o_scroll>`_ which has relevant information for this test.

    Renders many semi-transparent, partially overlapping SVG rectangles, and
    measures time to completion of this rendering.

    Note that this test also tends to reflect changes in network efficiency
    and navigation bar rendering issues:
   * Most of the page load tests measure from before the location is
    changed, until onload + mozafterpaint, therefore any changes in
    chrome performance from the location change, or network performance
    (the pages load from a local web server) would affect page load
    times. SVG opacity is rather quick by itself, so any such
    chrome/network/etc performance changes would affect this test more
    than other page load tests (relatively, in percentages).

   * **Possible regression causes**
      * Did you change the dimensions of the content area? Even a little? The
        tsvgx test seems to be sensitive to changes like this. See `bug
        1375479 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1375479>`__,
        for example. Usually, these sorts of "regressions" aren't real
        regressions
   * they just mean that we need to re-baseline our
        expectations from the test.

File IO
-------

File IO is tested using the tp5 test set in the `xperf`_
test.

Possible regression causes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **nonmain_startup_fileio opt (with or without e10s) windows7-32** –
   `bug
   1274018 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1274018>`__
   This test seems to consistently report a higher result for
   mozilla-central compared to Try even for an identical revision due to
   extension signing checks. In other words, if you are comparing Try
   and Mozilla-Central you may see a false-positive regression on
   perfherder. Graphs:
   `non-e10s <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/perf.html#/graphs?timerange=604800&series=%5Bmozilla-central,e5f5eaa174ef22fdd6b6e150e8c450aa827c2ff6,1,1%5D&series=%5Btry,e5f5eaa174ef22fdd6b6e150e8c450aa827c2ff6,1,1%5D>`__

Xres (X Resource Monitoring)
----------------------------

A memory metric tracked during tp5 test runs. This metric is sampled
every 20 seconds. This metric is collected on linux only.

`xres man page <https://linux.die.net/man/3/xres>`__.

% CPU
-----

Cpu usage tracked during tp5 test runs. This metric is sampled every 20
seconds. This metric is collected on windows only.

Responsiveness
--------------

contact: :jimm, :overholt

Measures the delay for the event loop to process a `tracer
event <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/Snappy#Current_Infrastructure>`__.
For more details, see `bug
631571 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=631571>`__.

The score on this benchmark is proportional to the sum of squares of all
event delays that exceed a 20ms threshold. Lower is better.

We collect 8000+ data points from the browser during the test and apply
`this
formula <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/talos/talos/output.py#l95>`__
to the results:

.. code-block:: python

   return sum([float(x)*float(x) / 1000000.0 for x in val_list])

xperf
=====

-  contact: fx-perf@mozilla.com
-  source: `xperf
   instrumentation <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/talos/talos/xtalos>`__
-  type: `Page load`_ (tp5n) / Startup_
-  measuring: IO counters from windows (currently, only startup IO is in
   scope)
-  reporting: Summary of read/write counters for disk, network (lower is
   better)

These tests only run on windows builds. See `this active-data
query <https://activedata.allizom.org/tools/query.html#query_id=zqlX+2Jn>`__
for an updated set of platforms that xperf can be found on. If the query
is not found, use the following on the query page:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "from":"task",
       "groupby":["run.name","build.platform"],
       "limit":2000,
       "where":{"regex":{"run.name":".*xperf.*"}}
   }

Talos will turn orange for 'x' jobs on windows 7 if your changeset
accesses files which are not predefined in the
`allowlist <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/talos/talos/xtalos/xperf_allowlist.json>`__
during startup; specifically, before the
"`sessionstore-windows-restored <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/0eebc33d8593/toolkit/components/startup/nsAppStartup.cpp#l631>`__"
Firefox event. If your job turns orange, you will see a list of files in
Treeherder (or in the log file) which have been accessed unexpectedly
(similar to this):

.. code-block:: none

    TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL : xperf: File '{profile}\secmod.db' was accessed and we were not expecting it. DiskReadCount: 6, DiskWriteCount: 0, DiskReadBytes: 16904, DiskWriteBytes: 0

In the case that these files are expected to be accessed during startup
by your changeset, then we can add them to the
`allowlist <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Testing&component=Talos>`__.

Xperf runs tp5 while collecting xperf metrics for disk IO and network
IO. The providers we listen for are:

-  `'PROC_THREAD', 'LOADER', 'HARD_FAULTS', 'FILENAME', 'FILE_IO',
   'FILE_IO_INIT' <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/talos/talos/xperf.config#l10>`__

The values we collect during stackwalk are:

-  `'FileRead', 'FileWrite',
   'FileFlush' <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/talos/talos/xperf.config#l11>`__

Notes:

-  Currently some runs may `return all-zeros and skew the
   results <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1614805>`__
-  Additionally, these runs don't have dedicated hardware and have a
   large variability. At least 30 runs are likely to be needed to get
   stable statistics (xref `bug
   1616236 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1616236>`__)

Build metrics
*************

These are not part of the Talos code, but like Talos they are benchmarks
that record data using the graphserver and are analyzed by the same
scripts for regressions.

Number of constructors (num_ctors)
==================================

This test runs at build time and measures the number of static
initializers in the compiled code. Reducing this number is helpful for
`startup
optimizations <https://blog.mozilla.org/tglek/2010/05/27/startup-backward-constructors/>`__.

-  https://hg.mozilla.org/build/tools/file/348853aee492/buildfarm/utils/count_ctors.py

   -  these are run for linux 32+64 opt and pgo builds.

Platform microbenchmark
***********************

IsASCII and IsUTF8 gtest microbenchmarks
========================================

-  contact: :hsivonen
-  source:
   `TestStrings.cpp <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/xpcom/tests/gtest/TestStrings.cpp>`__
-  type: Microbench_
-  reporting: intervals in ms (lower is better)
-  data: each test is run and measured 5 times
-  summarization: take the `median`_ of the 5 data points; `source:
   MozGTestBench.cpp <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/gtest/mozilla/MozGTestBench.cpp#43-46>`__

Test whose name starts with PerfIsASCII test the performance of the
XPCOM string IsASCII function with ASCII inputs if different lengths.

Test whose name starts with PerfIsUTF8 test the performance of the XPCOM
string IsUTF8 function with ASCII inputs if different lengths.

Possible regression causes
--------------------------

-  The --enable-rust-simd accidentally getting turned off in automation.
-  Changes to encoding_rs internals.
-  LLVM optimizations regressing between updates to the copy of LLVM
   included in the Rust compiler.

Microbench
==========

-  contact: :bholley
-  source:
   `MozGTestBench.cpp <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/gtest/mozilla/MozGTestBench.cpp>`__
-  type: Custom GTest micro-benchmarking
-  data: Time taken for a GTest function to execute
-  summarization: Not a Talos test. This suite is provides a way to add
   low level platform performance regression tests for things that are
   not suited to be tested by Talos.

PerfStrip Tests
===============

-  contact: :davidb
-  source:
   https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/xpcom/tests/gtest/TestStrings.cpp
-  type: Microbench_
-  reporting: execution time in ms (lower is better) for 100k function
   calls
-  data: each test run and measured 5 times
-  summarization:

PerfStripWhitespace - call StripWhitespace() on 5 different test cases
20k times (each)

PerfStripCharsWhitespace - call StripChars("\f\t\r\n") on 5 different
test cases 20k times (each)

PerfStripCRLF - call StripCRLF() on 5 different test cases 20k times
(each)

PerfStripCharsCRLF() - call StripChars("\r\n") on 5 different test cases
20k times (each)

Stylo gtest microbenchmarks
===========================

-  contact: :bholley, :SimonSapin
-  source:
   `gtest <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/style/test/gtest>`__
-  type: Microbench_
-  reporting: intervals in ms (lower is better)
-  data: each test is run and measured 5 times
-  summarization: take the `median`_ of the 5 data points; `source:
   MozGTestBench.cpp <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/gtest/mozilla/MozGTestBench.cpp#43-46>`__

Servo_StyleSheet_FromUTF8Bytes_Bench parses a sample stylesheet 20 times
with Stylo’s CSS parser that is written in Rust. It starts from an
in-memory UTF-8 string, so that I/O or UTF-16-to-UTF-8 conversion is not
measured.

Gecko_nsCSSParser_ParseSheet_Bench does the same with Gecko’s previous
CSS parser that is written in C++, for comparison.

Servo_DeclarationBlock_SetPropertyById_Bench parses the string "10px"
with Stylo’s CSS parser and sets it as the value of a property in a
declaration block, a million times. This is similar to animations that
are based on JavaScript code modifying Element.style instead of using
CSS @keyframes.

Servo_DeclarationBlock_SetPropertyById_WithInitialSpace_Bench is the
same, but with the string " 10px" with an initial space. That initial
space is less typical of JS animations, but is almost always there in
stylesheets or full declarations like "width: 10px". This microbenchmark
was used to test the effect of some specific code changes. Regressions
here may be acceptable if Servo_StyleSheet_FromUTF8Bytes_Bench is not
affected.

History of tp tests
*******************

tp
==

The original tp test created by Mozilla to test browser page load time.
Cycled through 40 pages. The pages were copied from the live web during
November, 2000. Pages were cycled by loading them within the main
browser window from a script that lived in content.

tp2/tp_js
=========

The same tp test but loading the individual pages into a frame instead
of the main browser window. Still used the old 40 page, year 2000 web
page test set.

tp3
===

An update to both the page set and the method by which pages are cycled.
The page set is now 393 pages from December, 2006. The pageloader is
re-built as an extension that is pre-loaded into the browser
chrome/components directories.

tp4
===

Updated web page test set to 100 pages from February 2009.

tp4m
====

This is a smaller pageset (21 pages) designed for mobile Firefox. This
is a blend of regular and mobile friendly pages.

We landed on this on April 18th, 2011 in `bug
648307 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=648307>`__. This
runs for Android and Maemo mobile builds only.

tp5
===

Updated web page test set to 100 pages from April 8th, 2011. Effort was
made for the pages to no longer be splash screens/login pages/home pages
but to be pages that better reflect the actual content of the site in
question. There are two test page data sets for tp5 which are used in
multiple tests (i.e. awsy, xperf, etc.): (i) an optimized data set
called tp5o, and (ii) the standard data set called tp5n.

tp6
===

Created June 2017 with recorded pages via mitmproxy using modern google,
amazon, youtube, and facebook. Ideally this will contain more realistic
user accounts that have full content, in addition we would have more
than 4 sites- up to top 10 or maybe top 20.

These were migrated to Raptor between 2018 and 2019.
