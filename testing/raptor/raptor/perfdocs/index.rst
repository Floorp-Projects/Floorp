Raptor is a performance-testing framework for running browser pageload and browser benchmark tests. Raptor is cross-browser compatible and is currently running in production on Firefox Desktop, Firefox Android GeckoView, Fenix, Reference Browser, Chromium, and Chrome.

Raptor currently supports three test types: 1) page-load performance tests, 2) standard benchmark-performance tests, and 3) "scenario"-based tests, such as power, CPU, and memory-usage measurements on Android (and desktop?).

Locally, Raptor can be invoked with the following command:

::

    ./mach raptor

**We're in the process of migrating away from webextension to browsertime. Currently, raptor supports both of them, but at the end of the migration, the support for webextension will be removed.**
