            Metrics starting with VP9/H264 give the number of frames dropped, and painted.

        description: The last visual change detected in the test (in ms).
    "Load Time":
        aliases:
            - loadtime

            - lcp
        description: >
            The time (in ms) at which the largest piece of content on the page was rendered/painted.
    "Speed Index":
        aliases:
            - SpeedIndex
        description: >
            A metric used to denote the speed at which a page loaded. Lower values indicate faster
            pageloads. Units are in (Visually-Complete x Milliseconds). Calculated by using videos
            of the pageload which provide a measure of visual completeness. Visual completeness is
            calculated by comparing the histogram of a given frame to the final frame of the pageload.
            The SpeedIndex is calculated as the area between the curves of a constant line at y=1,
            and the graph of the visual completeness from 0ms to when visual completeness reaches
            100% (or hits the y=1 line).
    "Contentful Speed Index":
        aliases:
            - ContentfulSpeedIndex
        description: >
            Similar to SpeedIndex, except that it uses the contentfulness of a frame to determine
            visual completeness instead of the histogram differences. The contentfulness is determined
            by calculating the number of edges found in the frame. A lower number of edges detected
            gives a smaller contentfulness value (and a smaller visually complete value).
    "Perceptual Speed Index":
        aliases:
            - PerceptualSpeedIndex
        description: >
            Similar to SpeedIndex, except that it uses the structural similarity index measure (ssim)
            to determine visual completeness. This technique compares the luminance, contrast, and
            structure of the frames (a given frame vs. a final frame) to determine the completeness.
