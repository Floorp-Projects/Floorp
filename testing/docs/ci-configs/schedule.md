# Schedule

For each CI config change, we need to follow:
 * scope of work (what will run, how frequently)
 * capacity planning (cost, physical space limitations)
 * will this replace anything or is this 100% new
 * puppet/deployment scripts or documentation
 * setup pool on try server
 * documented updated on this page, communicate with release management and others as appropriate

## Appendix:
 * *OS*: base operating system such as Android, Linux, Mac OSX, Windows
 * *Hardware*: specific cpu/memory/disk/graphics/display/inputs that we are using, could be physical hardware we own or manage, or it could be a cloud provider.
 * *Platform*: a combination of hardware and OS
 * *Configuration*: what we change on a platform (can be runtime with flags), installed OS software updates (service pack), tools (python/node/etc.), hardware or OS settings (anti aliasing, display resolution, background processes, clipboard), environment variables, 
 * *Test Failure*: a test doesnâ€™t report the expected result (if we expect fail and we crash, that is unexpected).  Typically this is a failure, but it can be a timeout, crash, not run, or even pass
 * *Greening up*: Assuming all tests return expected results (passing), they are green.  When tests fail, they are orange.  We need to find a way to get all tests green by investigating test failures.
