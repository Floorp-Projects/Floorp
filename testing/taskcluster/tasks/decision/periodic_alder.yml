      Decision task for testing purposes for alder.

  workerType: gecko-decision
  provisionerId: aws-provisioner

  scopes:
    - 'docker-worker:cache:tc-vcs-public-sources'

  payload:
    cache:
      # The taskcluster-vcs tooling stores the large clone caches in this
      # directory and will reuse them for new requests this saves about 20s~ and
      # is the most generic cache possible.
      tc-vcs-public-sources: '/home/worker/.tc-vcs/'

    # Note: This task is built server side without the context or tooling that
    # exist in tree so we must hard code the version
    image: 'quay.io/mozilla/decision:0.0.3'

    # Virtually no network or other potentially risky operations happen as part
    # of the task timeout aside from the initial clone. We intentionally have
    # set this to a lower value _all_ decision tasks should use a root
    # repository which is cached.
