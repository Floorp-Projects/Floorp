        :return: :class:`ADBProcess`

        shell() provides a low level interface for executing commands
        on the device via adb shell.

        shell() executes on the host in such as fashion that stdout
        contains the stdout and stderr of the host abd process
        combined with the stdout and stderr of the shell command
        on the device. The exit code of shell() is the exit code of
        the adb command if it was non-zero or the extracted exit code
        from the output of the shell command executed on the
        device.

        The caller provides a flag indicating if the command is to be
        executed as root, a string for any requested working
        directory, a hash defining the environment, a string
        containing shell commands, as well as a timeout period in
        seconds.

        The command line to be executed is created to set the current
        directory, set the required environment variables, optionally
        execute the command using su and to output the return code of
        the command to stdout. The command list is created as a
        command sequence separated by && which will terminate the
        command sequence on the first command which returns a non-zero
        exit code.

        A subprocess is spawned to execute adb shell for the device
        with stdout and stderr directed to a temporary file. If the
        process takes longer than the specified timeout, the process
        is terminated. The return code is extracted from the stdout
        and is then removed from the file.

        It is the caller's responsibilty to clean up by closing
        the stdout temporary files.

        If the yield_stdout flag is set, then the returned ADBProcess
        can be iterated over to get the output as it is produced by
        adb command. The iterator ends when the process timed out or
        if it exited. This flag is incompatible with stdout_callback.

        and returning matches even if the path is not a directory and
        by allowing a recursive listing.

        ls /sdcard always returns /sdcard and not the contents of the

        The ls method works around a Nexus 4 bug which prevents
        recursive listing of directories on the sdcard unless the path
        ends with "/*" by adjusting sdcard paths ending in "/" to end
        with "/*". This adjustment is only made on official Nexus 4
