    :param cmd: command to run. May be a string or a list. If specified as a list, the first
      element will be interpreted as the command, and all additional elements will be interpreted
      as arguments to that command.
    :param args: list of arguments to pass to the command (defaults to None). Must not be set when
      `cmd` is specified as a list.
    :param cwd: working directory for command (defaults to None).
    :param env: is the environment to use for the process (defaults to os.environ).
    :param ignore_children: causes system to ignore child processes when True,
      defaults to False (which tracks child processes).
    :param kill_on_timeout: when True, the process will be killed when a timeout is reached.
      When False, the caller is responsible for killing the process.
      Failure to do so could cause a call to wait() to hang indefinitely. (Defaults to True.)
    :param processOutputLine: function or list of functions to be called for
        each line of output produced by the process (defaults to an empty
        list).
    :param processStderrLine: function or list of functions to be called
        for each line of error output - stderr - produced by the process
        (defaults to an empty list). If this is not specified, stderr lines
        will be sent to the *processOutputLine* callbacks.
    :param onTimeout: function or list of functions to be called when the process times out.
    :param onFinish: function or list of functions to be called when the process terminates
      normally without timing out.
    :param kwargs: additional keyword args to pass directly into Popen.

    NOTE: Child processes will be tracked by default.  If for any reason
    we are unable to track child processes and ignore_children is set to False,
    then we will fall back to only tracking the root process.  The fallback
    will be logged.
