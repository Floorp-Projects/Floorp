/**
 *  This test includes following four test stages.
 *  1. CheckInitialValue: Checking the initial value of worker's current timer
 *     nesting level after the worker's top level script is loaded. The result
 *     is expected as 0.
 *  2. TestSetInterval: Checking the worker's current timer nesting level with
 *     setInterval with following steps
 *     1. call setInterval(callback, 0) to create a repeating timer.
 *     2. checking the current timer nesting level in the callback. The value
 *        should increase every time executing the callback until it reaches the
 *        maximun nesting level(5).
 *     3. Checking the worker's current timer nesting level with immediately
 *        resolved promise.
 *     4. Checking the the time duration between two callback launching.
 *  3. TestSetTimeout: Checking the worker's current timer nesting level with
 *     setTimeout. This stage has similar test steps with TestSetInterval.
 *     The difference is this stage using the recursive setTimeout to accumulate
 *     the timer nesting level.
 *  4. CheckNoTimer: Checking the situation which the worker has no pending
 *     timer. The result is expected as 0.
