This directory is intended for web-platform-tests that should be
upstreamed. The intent is to make this an automatic process, however
that does not work yet.

 When run they are mounted on the server under /_outbound/. Note that
this will change when the tests are upstreamed, so using absolute URLs
in tests should be avoided where possible.
