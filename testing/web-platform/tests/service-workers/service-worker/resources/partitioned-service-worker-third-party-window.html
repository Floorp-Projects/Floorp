<title>Service Worker: 3P window for partitioned service workers</title>
<script src="test-helpers.sub.js"></script>
<script src="/common/get-host-info.sub.js"></script>


<body>
This page should be opened as a third-party window. It then loads an iframe that
registers a service worker that, in turn, attempts to resolve its internal
Promise. Once that happens this window will postMessage back to the test to let
it know that the resolution occured.

If 3p partitioning is active then this Promise resolution won't
resolve the promise in the test's (that originally opened this page) 1p
service worker.

<script>

async function onLoad() {
  const message_promise = new Promise(resolve => {
    self.addEventListener('message', evt => {
      resolve(evt.data);
    });
  });

  const iframe_url = new URL(
    './partitioned-service-worker-third-party-iframe.html',
    get_host_info().HTTPS_ORIGIN + self.location.pathname);

  var frame = document.createElement('iframe');
  frame.src = iframe_url;
  frame.style.position = 'absolute';
  document.body.appendChild(frame);


  await message_promise.then(data => {
    // We're done, forward the message and clean up.
    window.opener.postMessage(data, '*');

    frame.remove();
  });
}

self.addEventListener('load', onLoad);
