This Gradle project exists only to list dependencies used to build Firefox for
Android.  Eventually, this definition will live in ``mobile/android``, or it
will just *be* ``mobile/android/app/build.gradle``.

Until we determine the best Docker and Taskcluster patterns for dependency
gathering and toolchain producing like this, this can live here.
