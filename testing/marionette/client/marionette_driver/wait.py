    evaluates to true or not null.

    This will repeatedly evaluate a condition in anticipation for a
    truthy return value, or its timeout to expire, or its waiting
    predicate to become true.

    A `Wait` instance defines the maximum amount of time to wait for a
    condition, as well as the frequency with which to check the
    condition.  Furthermore, the user may configure the wait to ignore
    specific types of exceptions whilst waiting, such as
    `errors.NoSuchElementException` when searching for an element on
    the page.

        list of ignored exceptions.  Optionally a different time
        implementation than the one provided by the standard library
        (time) can also be provided.

        Sample usage::

            # Wait 30 seconds for window to open, checking for its presence once
            # every 5 seconds.
            wait = Wait(marionette, timeout=30, interval=5,

            conditions, usually a Marionette instance.

        :param timeout: How long to wait for the evaluated condition
            to become true.  The default timeout is
            `wait.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`.

        :param interval: How often the condition should be evaluated.
            In reality the interval may be greater as the cost of
            evaluating the condition function. If that is not the case the
            interval for the next condition function call is shortend to keep
            the original interval sequence as best as possible.
            The default polling interval is `wait.DEFAULT_INTERVAL`.

        :param ignored_exceptions: Ignore specific types of exceptions
            whilst waiting for the condition.  Any exceptions not
            whitelisted will be allowed to propagate, terminating the
            wait.

        :param clock: Allows overriding the use of the runtime's
            default time library.  See `wait.SystemClock` for
            implementation details.
