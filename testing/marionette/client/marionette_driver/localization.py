    """An API which allows Marionette to handle localized content.

    The `localization`_ of UI elements in Gecko based applications is done via
    entities and properties. For static values entities are used, which are located
    in .dtd files. Whereby for dynamically updated content the values come from
    .property files. Both types of elements can be identifed via a unique id,
    and the translated content retrieved.

    For example::

        from marionette_driver.localization import L10n
        l10n = L10n(marionette)

        l10n.localize_entity(["chrome://branding/locale/brand.dtd"], "brandShortName")
        l10n.localize_property(["chrome://global/locale/findbar.properties"], "FastFind"))
