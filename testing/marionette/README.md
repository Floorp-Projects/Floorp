Marionette is the remote protocol that lets out-of-process programs
communicate with, instrument, and control Gecko-based browsers.

It provides interfaces for interacting with both the internal
JavaScript runtime and UI elements of Gecko-based browsers, such
as Firefox and Fennec.  It can control both the chrome- and content
documents, giving a high level of control and ability to replicate,
or emulate, user interaction.
