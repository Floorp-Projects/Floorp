Submitting patches
==================

You can submit patches by uploading .diff files to Bugzilla or by
sending them to [MozReview].

Once you have contributed a couple of patches, we are happy to
sponsor you in [becoming a Mozilla committer].  When you have been
granted commit access level 1 you will have permission to use the
[Firefox CI] to trigger your own “try runs” to test your changes.
