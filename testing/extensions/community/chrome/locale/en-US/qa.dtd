<html:h4>Welcome to the Mozilla Quality Assurance community!</html:h4>
Mozilla Quality Assurance (QA) is a network of countless volunteers
from the Internet community, along with a group of Mozilla employees, who share
the common mission of <html:i>taming the lizard</html:i> through testing and
constructively reporting bugs in Mozilla products.
<html:br/><html:br/>
This extension allows you to <html:b>find bugs</html:b> in Mozilla products by
running simple tests within the browser. Helping out doesn't take up much of
your time, doesn't require any special skills, and helps to improve Mozilla
products like Firefox and Thunderbird.
<html:br/><html:br/>
When you find a bug, this extension helps you to <html:b>report it</html:b>
to <html:a href='http://litmus.mozilla.org/' target='_blank'>Litmus</html:a>,
the tool we use to track our testing efforts. Your test results are valuable,
and we use them to ensure that all features work properly across a wide range
of platforms, operating systems, and configurations.

<html:h4>Why Should I Get Involved?</html:h4>

<html:h5>For more information on Mozilla Quality Assurance, please
see the
<html:a href='http://wiki.mozilla.org/Mozilla_QA_Community' target='_blank'>
Mozilla QA Community Wiki</html:a>.</html:h5>

<!ENTITY qa.setup.abouttext	"
<html:h4>How do I get started?</html:h4>
Getting started with Mozilla QA is easy! This setup wizard will ask you a
few simple questions. Once that's done, you will be taken to the test runner,
where you can select what you want to test, run those tests, and submit your
results to Litmus. You'll also have a chance to learn about QA Community
events and other ways to get involved.

<html:h4>A note on privacy</html:h4>
When you use the QA Extension, you are submitting test results to an
open system. Other members of the community will access the information you
submit in order to improve the quality of Mozilla products. You
<html:b>should not</html:b> submit any private or confidential information
using the Mozilla QA Extension. If you provide your real name or an IRC nickname
to display instead, we will hide your email address from
public view to help prevent email harvesting bots from spamming you.
