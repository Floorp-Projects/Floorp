        <h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>
        <p id="summary">
            Since 2006, Mozilla has awarded over two million dollars to fund
            projects that contribute to the health of the Open Web. The
            Mozilla Grants program is jointly funded by the Mozilla
            Corporation and the Mozilla Foundation, and awards financial
            support to individuals and organizations whose work supports and
            enhances the mission and values of the Mozilla Project.

        <h2><a name="goals">Goals</a></h2>
        <p id="goals">
            Mozilla makes grants to individuals and organizations all over
            the world. We mainly fund activity that supports the Mozilla
            Grants program's four target areas:

            <ul id="goal_list">
                <li id="accessibility">
                    <strong>Accessibility:</strong> Mozilla believes that
                    the Internet truly is for everyone, and that those with
                    disabilities should be able to participate on the Web
                    along with their sighted and hearing peers. As part of
                    our accessibility strategy, we are funding the
                    development of free, open source options for those with
                    visual and auditory impairments.
                </li>

                <li id="community">
                    <strong>Community:</strong> Mozilla offers suppport to
                    the broader free culture and open source community, as
                    part of Mozilla's general effort to 'give back', aiding
                    in the creation of technologies and projects that
                    increase the health of the open Web ecosystem.
                </li>

                <li id="education">
                    <strong>Education:</strong> As part of Mozilla's broader
                    education initiative, we support educational
                    institutions that are producing the next generation of
                    innovative creators of software.
                </li>

                <li id="open_source">
                    <strong>Open Source:</strong> These grants support the
                    creation and adoption of Web standards, open source
                    principles, and the overall principles of transparency,
                    collaboration, and openness that free and open source
                    software projects adhere to.
                </li>
