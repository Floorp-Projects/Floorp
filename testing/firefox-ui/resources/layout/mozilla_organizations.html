            Mozilla is a global community of people creating a better
            Internet. We build public benefit into the Internet by creating
            free, open source products and technologies that improve the
            online experience for people everywhere.
        </p>

        <h2><a name="organization">Organization</a></h2>
        <p id="organization">
            There are several organizations that support the Mozilla
            community and Mozilla's principles. They include the non-profit
            Mozilla Foundation as well as two wholly owned taxable
            subsidiaries, the Mozilla Corporation and Mozilla Messaging.
            Mozilla considers itself a hybrid organization, combining non-
            profit and market strategies to ensure the Internet remains a
            shared public resource.
