            Mozilla's mission is to <strong>promote openness, innovation,
            and opportunity on the web</strong>. We do this by creating
            great software, like the Firefox browser, and building
            movements, like Drumbeat, that give people tools to take control
            of their online lives.
        </p>

        <h2><a name="organization">Organization</a></h2>
        <p id="organization">
            As a non-profit organization, we define success in terms of
            building communities and enriching people's lives instead of
            benefiting our shareholders (guess what: we don't even have
            shareholders). We believe in the power and potential of the
            Internet and want to see it thrive for everyone, everywhere.
        </p>

        <h2><a name="goal">Goal</a></h2>
        <p id="goal">
            <strong>
                Building a better Internet is an ambitious goal, but we
                believe that it is possible
            </strong>
            when people who share our passion get involved. Coders, artists,
            writers, testers, surfers, students, grandparents; anyone who
            uses and cares about the web can help make it even better.
