        <h2><a name="history">History</a></h2>
        <p id="history">
            When www.mozilla.org was launched in 1998 all community activity
            occurred right here on this site.  Since then the community has
            grown much bigger and there are now many different sites,
            forums, blogs and newsgroups in different places that track
            different parts of the project.  These pages aim to be a
            comprehensive list to all of the different community resources
            available.  If you know of something that's not on these lists
            that should be, please contact us and we'll update these
            pages.
        </p>

        <h2><a name="communicate">Communicate</a></h2>
        <p id="communicate">
            There are a number of different ways community members
            communicate and coordinate (people use mailing lists and
            newsgroups, blogs, forums, wikis and they even meet in real
            life sometimes too) and all of these options might be
            overwhelming at first.  Hopefully this set of links will provide
            some useful pointers to help you figure out where to go to find
            what you're looking for.  If you do get lost though and need
            some help, feel free to ask for more information.

            Please note that this is intended to be an entry point that
            provides a high-level overview of the different community areas.
