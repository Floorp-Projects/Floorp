TPS is a test automation framework for Firefox Sync. See
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/TPS for documentation.

Installation
============

TPS requires several packages to operate properly. To install TPS and
required packages, use the INSTALL.sh script, provided:

  ./INSTALL.sh /path/to/create/virtualenv

This script will create a virtalenv and install TPS into it. TPS can then
be run by activating the virtualenv and executing:

  runtps --binary=/path/to/firefox


Configuration
=============
To edit the TPS configuration, do not edit config/config.json.in in the tree.
Instead, edit config.json inside your virtualenv; it will be located at
something like:

  (linux): /path/to/virtualenv/lib/python2.6/site-packages/tps-0.2.40-py2.6.egg/tps/config.json
  (win): /path/to/virtualenv/Lib/site-packages/tps-0.2.40-py2.6.egg/tps/config.json


Setting Up Test Accounts
========================

Firefox Accounts
----------------
To create a test account for using the Firefox Account authentication perform the
following steps:

1. Go to a URL like http://restmail.net/mail/%account_prefix%@restmail.net
2. Go to https://accounts.firefox.com/signup?service=sync&context=fx_desktop_v1
3. Sign in with the previous chosen email address and a password
4. Go back to the Restmail URL, reload the page
5. Search for the verification link and open that page

Now you will be able to use your setup Firefox Account for Sync.
