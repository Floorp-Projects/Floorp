TPS is a test automation framework for Firefox Sync. See
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/TPS for documentation.

Installation
============

TPS requires several packages to operate properly. To install TPS and
required packages, use the INSTALL.sh script, provided:

  python3 create_venv.py /path/to/create/virtualenv

This script will create a virtalenv and install TPS into it.

You must then activate the virtualenv by executing:

-  (linux): source /path/to/virtualenv/Scripts/activate
-  (win): /path/to/virtualenv/Scripts/activate.bat

TPS can then be run by executing:

  runtps --binary=/path/to/firefox

When you are done with TPS, you can deactivate the virtualenv by executing
`deactivate`

Configuration
=============
To edit the TPS configuration, do not edit config/config.json.in in the tree.
Instead, edit config.json inside your virtualenv; it will be located at the
top level of where you specified the virtualenv be created - eg, for the
example above, it will be `/path/to/create/virtualenv/config.json`

Setting Up Test Accounts
========================

Firefox Accounts
----------------
To create a test account for using the Firefox Account authentication perform the
following steps:

1. Go to a URL like http://restmail.net/mail/%account_prefix%@restmail.net
2. Go to https://accounts.firefox.com/signup?service=sync&context=fx_desktop_v1
3. Sign in with the previous chosen email address and a password
4. Go back to the Restmail URL, reload the page
5. Search for the verification link and open that page

Now you will be able to use this account for TPS. Note that these
steps can be done in either a test profile or in a private browsing window - you
might want to avoid doing that in a "real" profile that's already connected to
Sync.
