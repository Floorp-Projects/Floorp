    // the UNIX epoch. This makes it a little tricky to
    // calculate when the paint actually occurred relative
    // to the starting time that's been appended to the
    // page's URL.
    //
    // Thankfully, the PerformanceTiming API gives us a
    // sense of when this page's lifetime started, relative
    // to the UNIX epoch - the "fetchStart". Taking that
    // time and adding the paintTimeStamp should give us
    // a pretty decent approximation of when since the
    // UNIX epoch the paint actually occurred for this
    // content.
    //
    // We can then subtract the starting time to get the
    // delta, which should now represent the time it took
    // from requesting that the tab be opened, to the
    // paint occurring within the tab.
