			    "The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual
			    occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the
			    old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly
			    beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my
			    eyes.  She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or
			    dying away like a nightingale of the woods.

			    "When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first
			    declined it.  She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in
			    sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger.  The old
			    man appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to
			    explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she
			    bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.

			    "The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration
			    that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.
			    Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the
			    knowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most
			    of the words uttered by my protectors.

			    "In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and
			    the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the
			    scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods;
			    the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal
			    rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably
			    shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never
			    ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same
			    treatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.

			    "My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily
			    master the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than
			    the Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken
			    accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that
			    was spoken.

			    "While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as
			    it was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field
			    for wonder and delight.

			    "The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney's Ruins of
			    Empires.  I should not have understood the purport of this book had not
			    Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations.  He had chosen
			    this work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in
			    imitation of the Eastern authors.  Through this work I obtained a
			    cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at
			    present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners,
			    governments, and religions of the different nations of the earth.  I
			    heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous genius and mental
			    activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early
			    Romans--of their subsequent degenerating--of the decline of that mighty
			    empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings.  I heard of the discovery
			    of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of
			    its original inhabitants.

			    "These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings.  Was
			    man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so
			    vicious and base?  He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil
			    principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and
			    godlike.  To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour
			    that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on
			    record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more
			    abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm.  For a long time I
			    could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or
			    even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of
			    vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and
			    loathing.

			    "Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.
			    While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the
			    Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me.  I
			    heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid
			    poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.

			    "The words induced me to turn towards myself.  I learned that the
			    possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and
			    unsullied descent united with riches.  A man might be respected with
			    only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered,
			    except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to
			    waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few!  And what was I? Of
			    my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I
			    possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property.  I was, besides,
			    endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even
			    of the same nature as man.  I was more agile than they and could
			    subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with
			    less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs.  When I looked
			    around I saw and heard of none like me.  Was I, then, a monster, a blot
			    upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?

			    "I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted
			    upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with
			    knowledge.  Oh, that I had forever remained in my native wood, nor
			    known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!

			    "Of what a strange nature is knowledge!  It clings to the mind when it
			    has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock.  I wished sometimes to
			    shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one
			    means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death--a state
			    which I feared yet did not understand.  I admired virtue and good
			    feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my
			    cottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except
			    through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and
			    unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of
			    becoming one among my fellows.  The gentle words of Agatha and  the
			    animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me.  The mild
			    exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved
			    Felix were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch!

			    "Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply.  I heard of the
			    difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the
			    father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the
			    older child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up
			    in the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained
			    knowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which
			    bind one human being to another in mutual bonds.
