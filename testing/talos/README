Talos is a python performance testing framework that is usable on Windows,
Mac and Linux. Talos is our versatile performance testing framework we
use at Mozilla. It was created to serve as a test runner for the existing
performance tests that Mozilla was running back in 2007 as well as providing
an extensible framework for new tests as they were created.

So, why Talos? Talos is the bronze automaton of Greek myth. Talos protected
the island of Crete, throwing giant boulders at unwary seamen. He's
also purported to have heated himself glowing hot and then embraced his
enemies. Basically, he was awesome.
