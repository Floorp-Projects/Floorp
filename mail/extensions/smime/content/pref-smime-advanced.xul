<!-- XXX: hack...to avoid duplicate string entries and JS, load am-smime.dtd and am-smime.js
     since we are really just re-exposing part of that UI here in the pref panel. 

     We are turning the Password group in the advanced panel into the Password and Security
     group and then adding our two security buttons. We could also consider doing this under
     Privacy and Security instead. I may change my mind later.
