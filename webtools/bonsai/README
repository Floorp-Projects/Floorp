This is Bonsai.  See <http://www.mozilla.org/bonsai.html>.


	==========
	DISCLAIMER
	==========

This is not very well packaged code.  It's not packaged at all.  Don't
come here expecting something you plop in a directory, twiddle a few
things, and you're off and using it.  Much work has to be done to get
there.  We'd like to get there, but it wasn't clear when that would be,
and so we decided to let people see it first.

Don't believe for a minute that you can use this stuff without first
understanding most of the code.

Check out the INSTALL file for some guidance on getting started.
Many, many thanks to Artem Belevich <abelevic@ctron.com> for
trailblazing his way through this and writing down all the problems he
had.


	============================
	Configuration files you need
	============================

Lots of configuration files need to be placed in the data subdir.
This is also where bonsai keeps its running state.  These two things
ought to be split into different directories, but that hasn't happened
yet.

Some of these files are:
treeconfig.pl: 	some Perl source that defines @::TreeList, a list of trees you
		want to track, and %::TreeInfo, information about each of those
		trees. 

params:	This file contains many operating parameters.  This can be 
	edited using the editparams.cgi webpage; you should probably
	not edit it directory.

	The ./configure script will make a guess at the parameters
	that control paths for scripts to execute, and create an
	initial params file for you.  It looks for things on your
	PATH, so if it complains, add the directories in which these
	commands reside to your PATH, or override the path check, for
	example:

		setenv PERL /usr/local/lib/perl5
		./configure

	or for the Bourne shell:

		PERL=/usr/local/lib/perl5 ./configure


hidelist:	A list of regexps that define filenames that we don't want
		to let people see via the bonsai pages.  A common use is to
		just have one line that says "CVSROOT". Note that the files
		and directories will actually be visible, this just prevents
		people from looking at their contents.

legaldirs:	A list of directories to traverse when rebuilding the
		history of the repository.  This file is required to exist
		for each module before you can start populating that module
		with existing cvs data.
		

	=================================
	What's What in the Bonsai sources:
	=================================

This is a rough first pass at cataloging and documenting the Bonsai
sources.  Many hands have been in this code over the years, and it has
accreted wildly.  There is probably quite a lot of dead code in here.

Makefile.in:		"make install" lets you specify where you store
			perl and bonsai on your system.

addcheckin.pl		Perl. Add a checkin to a Bonsai hook. Determines
			if the tree was open or closed at the time, shunts
			checkin to proper tree.

admin.cgi		Perl.  Select from various administrative tasks 
			(which require a password.)

			Called by: toplevel.cgi

	=================
	Glossary of terms
	=================

Here are some funky terms you may find here and there:

Hook			The 'hook' is actually the oldest part of the Bonsai
			code.  The idea is, every so often (at Netscape, it was
			every day), some build engineers will close the tree
			and make sure that everything still builds properly.
			If it doesn't, then the build engineers want to have a
			list of people they can go beat up, this being the list
			of people who changed the tree since the last time they
			successfully built the tree.  Those people are "on the
			hook"; they are held responsible for any probs that
			arise.

			So, it works out to: the list of people who have
			checked in since the tree was last closed.
