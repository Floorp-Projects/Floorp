As it's said in README "This is not very well packaged code.  It's
not packaged at all.  Don't come here expecting something you plop in
a directory, twiddle a few things, and you're off and using it.  Much
work has to be done to get there." 

This file is intended to make some things *easier* but not easy. You
are still required to make some changes on your own. There is no
guaranteed solution yet and it's unlikely that there will be one in
the nearest future.

0. OVERVIEW

Some time ago I've seen Linux Source Navigator (LSN) at
http://sunsite.unc.edu/linux-source. I was impressed. 
It was and is a wanderful tool to explore Linux kernel source code.

Then Mozilla.org came up with a more elaborate tool that includes
source browser with crossreferencing (LXR http://lxr.linux.no) and CVS
tree control (Bonsai - http://www.mozilla.org/bonsai.html). 
While LXR formatting is not as pretty as LSN's one, it has a huge
advantage - it lets you see where the identifier is defined and used.
And Bonsai brings nice and easy (though sometimes incompatible with
browsers other but Netscape's own) intarface to the CVS history. This
includes getting list of changes, giffs between revisions, etc.

All in all LXR+Bonsai+other stuff beneath is a useful tool capable
of handling huge projects. 

It's not that easy to make it work with other source tree but
Mozilla's own but it's possible. And there are a lot of things to
improve. Now I'm going to concentrate on the first goal - to make it
work. 


1. GETTING IT UP

   First of all you have to get all the tools in mozilla's
mozilla/webtools CVS repository. This includes lxr,bonsai,registry
and tinderbox. You're likely will not need neither tinderbox nor
registry but get them just in case.

   To get the sources you have to follow instructions on
http://www.mozilla.org/bonsai.html.

   OK, now you've got the sources but don't rush to try it right
away. It's likely that you will not be able to even start most of
the scripts. There are more things you will have to get and install.
The short list of the things you will need:

   1) MySQL database server.
   2) Tcl 7.6
   3) TclX 7.6
   4) mysqltcl program (hmm.. This was tricky.. Read on)
   5) Perl 5.004+ with Mysql module (included with MySQL).
   6) Date::Parse module for Perl
   7) Some kind of HTTP server so you could use CGI scripts

1.1 Getting and setting up MySQL database

   Visit MySQL homepage at http://www.tcx.se and grab the latest
stable binary release of the server. Sure, you can get sources and
compile them yourself, but binaries are the easiest and the fastest
way to get it up and running. Follow instructions found in
manual. There is a section about installing binary-only
distributions. 

   You should create database bonsai. It may be a good idea to make it
writable by all users on your machine and change access level
later. This would save you a lot of time trying to guess whether it's
permissions or a mistake in the script that make things fail.

1.2-3 Getting and building Tcl & TclX 7.6

    Tcl homepage is at http://www.scriptics.com. You may get sources
for UNIX from ftp://ftp.scriptics.com/pub/tcl/tcl7_6/tcl7.6p2.tar.gz.
TclX is an extension for Tcl that adds a lot of useful functions that
are heavily used in Bonsai tool. 
TclX page is http://www.neosoft.com/tclx. Download sources from
ftp://ftp.neosoft.com/pub/tcl/TclX/tclX7.6.0.tar.gz. Watch out for the
case of the letters in URL. These guys are going to bring some fun
into your life by spelling their program name in various ways.

    Now you've probably got both Tcl and TclX 7.6. You may try to use
version 8.X but I'm not sure about results. Unfortunately I'm not an
expert in "Tcl&Co.".

    Build and install Tcl first. Then build and install TclX. This
should go without serious problems

1.4 mysqltcl - the tricky part

   Grab msqltcl 1.50 (yes, "msqltcl" without 'y'. That's not a typo) from
MySQL site's contributed software area (http://www.tcx.se/Contrib/) or
from mSQL site (www.hughes.com.au). I've used version 1.50 and it
works for me, though you may try more recent version at your own
risk. You're risking anyway. 

   Then grab mysqltcl.c-patch from MySQL's contrib area and apply this
patch to msqltcl.c file from msqltcl-1.50 distribution. 

   Try to make msqltcl binary which is in fact mYsqltcl already. Very
likely that you will not be able to compile it without modifications.
    
   You can use the patch in APPENDIX 1 to see what changes I had to make
to compile mysqltcl. Your mileage may vary.

1.5 Perl + Mysql

   Besides mysqltcl you will need Perl 5.004 with DB and Mysql
extensions. 

   DB is required to use LXR browser and crossreferencer for storing
its database. Mysql is used by Bonsai.

   If you have Perl already installed, try to run genxref program from
LXR suite. If it complains that it misses DB terribly then you're
probably will have to get and install DB 1.86 distribution from one of the
CPAN (www.cpan.org) mirrors in src/misc directory. I personally got it
from http://www.cpan.org/src/misc/db.1.86.tar.gz. Having DB compiled
and installed you will also have to rebuild and reinstall Perl
itself so It would recognize and compile DB module in. This can be
tricky if you have DB installed in some strange place as I did. 
I've got an error during linking phase - there was a function missing
in hash/ndbm.c file, so I just commented it out. It may potentially
cause troubles, but I think it does not matter in our case as this
was intended only for DBM compatibility - the feature we don't really
use. 

   Now you hopefully have Perl + DB compiled installed and working.
Time to set up Mysql module. This one is easy. Just follow
instructions in MySQL manual. You have to read manuals sometimes.. 
I think I'm getting older.. 8-)

   Next step is to get TimeDate module from one of the CPAN mirrors.
Go to CPAN search page
(http://theory.uwinnipeg.ca/search/cpan-search.html) and search for
the "TimeDate" module. Then get it and install.

1.6 HTTP server

You have a freedom of choice here - Apache, Netscape or any other
server on UNIX would do. The only thing - to make configuration easier
you'd better run HTTP daemon on the same machine that you run MySQL
server on. Make sure that you can access 'bonsai' database with user
id you're running the daemon with.


2. TWEAKING THE TOOLS

   Now you should have all necessary tools to be able to run LXR and
Bonsai scripts and see why the wouldn't work for you right now. 

   First of all you have to change "#!/usr/bonsaitools" to wherever
you've installed your binaries in all executable scripts in LXR and
Bonsai directories. 


2.1 LXR

   The first thing to set up is LXR tool. All it needs is the source
tree (not CVS tree). It's relatively easy and works almost right of
the box. Follow instructions in LXR README file. 

   Having set LXR you will see that regardless what your source tree
contains you will see that everything refers to it as Mozilla. Mozilla
is a great thing and this tool was primarily tailored to mozilla tree
but you'd like to control your own tree. First step is to edit your

Here is the short list of changes I had to make

  file: ident
    1) change "&root=/cvsroot" to tour CVSROOT path
    2) change "file=/mozilla/" to the directory under CVSROOT where
       your sources are. In my case it is just "/"

  file: index.html
    Nothing vital here but probably worth changing to reflect your own
    environment

  file: lxr.conf
    Changes to this file are described in LXR README file and are
    quite simple.

  file: source
    You may find it useful to uncomment "$img = "/icons/..." lines if
    you yse Explorer as it does not have internal-gopher-* images
    built in. Actually Bonsai contains a lot of netscapism that will
    make your IE4 unhappy anyway. You'd better stick with Netscape if
    you are going to use LXR/Bonsai

  file: template-*
    Here you will probably want to watch closely at the places whare
    you see the word 'mozilla' near '.cgi'. There are a lot of
    mozilla-specific paths hardcoded
    
    cgange/get rid of banner that loads straight from mozilla.org that
    may be very dangerous if you're working for micro$oft and your
    boss comes by.. 8-) 

2.2 Bonsai

   This stuff sometimes gets very specific about your CVS repository
setup. You have to make a lot of changes until more portable
configuration mechanism is introduced. 

   First of all, create data/ directory in your Bonsai dir. Then edit
data/configuration file as described in README file. Create
appropriate data/XXX directory for each tree XXX you've configured in
'configuration'. Compile trapdoor program and place binary in data/
dir. run 'trapdoor <admin password here> >data/passwd' it will set up
admin's password. At least it should. It worked for me with empty
password, but I still am unable to change it from the web.

   file: createlegaldirs.tcl
      change /tools/ns/bin/cvs to real path to your cvs command

   file: cvsblame.cgi
      @line 120: you may add your own translation to help find
      appropriate RCS file for the given source file.
      TODO: We'd better get this information from CVS/Repository
            file. It's more generic than hardcoded tweaks.

   file: cvslog.cgi
      @line 90: the same tweaks to find RCS file for given source file
      @ line 463: change $lxr_base from mozilla site to your own
		  add translations to $lxr_path to help find source
		  file for given RCS file.
      TODO: This should be done using information in
            $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/modules file. Typical example is the
	    following line: 'mymodule -d mydir repositorydir' which
	    causes files for module mymodule from repositorydir to be
	    placed in mydir. This contains enough information about
	    backward translation mydir/file->repositorydir/file,v


   file: cvsquery.cgi
      @line 23: There are some cases when cvsrot is not passed as
          parameter for cvsquery.cgi. You should better check for
	  empty CVS_ROOT and set it to your CVSROOT path.

      @line 71: Here we should try to make backward translation for
          directory name similar to one @line 463 in cvslog.cgi.

      
      @line 151: you will probably want to send email somewhere else
	  but people @netscape.com 8-)


   file: cvsview2.cgi
      @line 393: set $rcsdiff to your real rcsdiff program
      @line 469&658: set $lxr_base appropriately
      @line 783: change path to "co" command

   file: dolog.pl
      @line 177: change path to rlog program

   file: multidiff.pl
      @line 72: change path to rcsdiff program

   file: rebuildcvshistory.cgi
      @line 59: change path to rlog program
      @line 211: change path to cvs program

   file: rebuildtaginfo.cgi
      @line 42: change path to rlog program

   file: toplevel.cgi
      @line 240: remove links that are not accessible to you anyway


That's basically it. With some luck and persistence you will have 90%
working system at this point. A lot of these things are just asking to be
fixed in near feature. And I hope they will be.

3. Setting up database

   This is quite simple but time consuming operation.
First create database structure using maketable.sh csript.
Then go to Bonsai administration page and press "Rebuild CVS history"
button. Then you may go to the theater and watch a movie or two. It
will talke a lot of time. It takes several seconds to process one
file. The more revisions in file the more time it will take. My SUN
workstation with 2x200Mhz UltraSPARC processors run about an hour to
process about 4K files with 20K+ revisions. Your mileage may vary.
 
4. Things to do

  a) There should be better way to track CVS tree changes. Now it's done
by making CVS send e-mail about each checkin. Then some cron job
process this mail and updates database. CVS history command provides
all necessary information to get list of files recently commited, so
there is no need to send/process email. Just set up a cron job that
will periodically look for CVS tree changes and update database.

  b) Better configuration. One should not hardcode CVS tree <-> Source
tree  translations. Also location of CVS/RCS binaries should be
configurable. Another thing to configure - banners.

  c) LXR could be improved in a number of ways. Using MySQL database
instead of DB would probably be a good idea. It's unclear what impact
it will have on performance though. Incremental database updates would
be nice. It might be also nice to borrow syntax highliting from LSN.


5. Conclusion.

   OK. This may or may not work for you. But I hope you had a great
time trying. Or just reading.

   Any suggestions/additions are welcome.
