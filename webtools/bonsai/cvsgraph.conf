#
# - Empty lines and whitespace are ignored.
#
# - Comments start with '#' and everything until
#   end of line is ignored.
#
# - Strings are C-style strings in which characters
#   may be escaped with '\' and written in octal
#   and hex escapes. Note that '\' must be escaped
#   if it is to be entered as a character.
#
# - Some strings are expanded with printf like
#   conversions which start with '%'. Not all
#   are applicable at all times, in which case they
#   will expand to noting.
