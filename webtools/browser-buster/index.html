Browser Buster: an eyeball hour testing project
<p>This is a sanity checking and stress testing system for the browser.
The system loads
<br>various lists of pages for as long as the browser will continue to
run.
<p>The tests can be started from any browser by visiting one of the links
below.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a href="test_url_25.html">test_url_25.html</a>
<ul>
<li>
top 100 site list - new page loaded every 25 seconds</li>
</ul>
Sorter cycles are good for flipping through lots of pages and covering
lots of tests quickly.
<br>Longer cycles are for using on dialup/slower speed connections, running
under debug or
<br>purify builds,&nbsp; browsing around looking at sites and reading content,
etc...
<p>Here is the <a href="pagelist.html">current list of the pages</a> that
are tested each cycle and some other interesting
<br>pages that you can load "by hand."
<p>Click here to <a href="count-reset.html">reset your page counter</a>&nbsp;
if you like to count the number of pages that
<br>you have loaded in any one testing session.
<p>Contact <a href="mailto:chofmann">chofmann</a> to add test URLs or kick
the system if it doesn't seem to be responding..
