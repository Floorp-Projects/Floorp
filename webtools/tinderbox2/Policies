Preparations you will need to make and 
policies you will need to set:
-----------------------------------


To install tinderbox you will need some information about your
existing computer systems and some idea about what your goals are.
Here is a list of questions to help get you started, some of these
ideas may not be appropriate for your environment.


The webserver will serve the tinderbox pages.  
Webserver configuration is a bit of an art and you will need to
understand the policies which are used to administer your webserver.

*) You will need to decide the directory where tinderbox should write
the static HTML pages.  This will depend on how your webserver is
configured. The default location is based on the RedHat 7.1
(apache-1.3.19-5) installation and is: /var/www/html/tinderbox2.  You
will also need to know what the URL browsers will need to use to find
this directory. Since tinderbox generates static web pages, it is
possible to run tinderbox and not run a web server.  One way this
could be done is if you have a network file system and all users have
browsers which can read from the HTML directories.  In this case all
URL's should begin with "file:/" instead of the usual "http://".

*) Project level administration is done via cgi scripts.  These
scripts allow administrators to set the message of the day, and the
state of the tree (open, closed, restricted).  Also all users can post
notices to the web pages via a cgi script.  CGI programs are often
restricted to a portion of the file system which is disjoint from the
HTML files. You will need to figure out where the CGI programs will
go.  Tinderbox takes its defaults from RedHat 7.1 and uses:
/var/www/cgi-bin/tinderbox2. You will also need to know what the URL
browsers will need to use to find this directory.

*) CGI scripts will run as an unauthenticated user on your system.
You will need to decide which user will run the tinderbox CGI scripts.
The same user id must be used for running the scripts as for tinderbox
mail delivery.  The Tinderbox Configuration files will define this
user id and as a security precaution check that it is running as the
required id.  It is suggested that this id not be a privileged id
(higher ids are better, please make this number be greater than 10 and
bigger than 100 is recommended).  Smaller ids are often assumed to
have more privileges on a Unix box then larger ids.  It is not a good
idea for an unauthenticated user to have any privileges so a large id
is recommended. It is also recommended that you not use the id 'nobody'
as this id is over used and it would be better to partition the
unauthenticated user into separate ids in case of security problems.
RedHat runs all its CGI scripts as the user 'apache', this is an
acceptable user.  I would prefer to have a separate user to run the
tinderbox CGI scripts but this would require recompiling apache to
enable suEXEC, and it is more effort then most groups can afford.

*) Tinderbox Files. There are other tinderbox files which need to be
placed on the webserver.  These include libraries and non-cgi
programs. You will need to decide where to place these files.  Most
users put them in /home/tinderbox2.

*) Tinderbox Data. Tinderbox stores its data in the file system.  For
security it is often a good idea to keep this data out of the HTML and
CGI directories so that malicious users can not directly access this
data.  The compressed build logs can grow quite large, so it is
recommended to put the data on a file system with room.  The default
is to put them in the directory /home/tinderbox2/data.


Mail
----

*) Many of the tinderbox modules (Bug Ticket, Build, CVS) receive
their data via mail.  The mail system on you web server machine must
be configured to deliver the mail into the tinderbox mail processing
programs.  You should spend some time understanding how your mail
delivery system can be configured to allow user mail to be delivered
into a program and how to set the user id under which this delivery
occurs.  If you do not wish to configure your mail delivery program
then you can use fetchmail to pull the mail out of a mail box and push
it into the programs on a periodic basis.  See the install page for
details on what I have learned about mailing systems.


Production Version Control
-------------------------

One of the biggest responsibilities which a "buildmaster" has is the
requirement that all code should be reproducible.  That is that at
any point in the future, even more than one year later, the current
binaries should be able to be rebuilt byte for byte from sources.
This requirement can be broken down as follows:

1) The build machine must be reproducible.  

We must be able to get back the same build machine we had at any point
in the past.  This means that all OS libraries, all header files, all
compilers, all build tools (make, grep, sed) must have some mechanism
to roll back.  It is common to use a backup of the build machine to
reconstruct it.  Most OS will give you a list of the software packages
which are installed on the machine and their version numbers.  I like
to keep the list of software packages which are installed on the
machine checked into version control.  This allows me to compare the
state of the build machine at any two points in time.  I have tools to
recreate the build-machine from just a list of packages with version
numbers. It is considered a best practice to limit the amount of
software which is available on the build machine.  A build machine
with too much installed will only make it difficult to reproduce older
builds should the need arise.  I recommend not installing any
web servers or graphical window managers on your build machine.  It
should be clear that the build machine should not be the same machine
where the tinderbox server runs.

2) The build process must be reproducible.  That is all the steps
which are used to create the application must be reproducible.

*) Build Interface: We must be able to run exactly the same build
process in the future including: all commands with command line
arguments, all environmental variables.  I recommend that the entire
build process be viewed as something outside of the build master
control.  Developers are responsible for ensuring that there is a
simple build master interface to construct all the software products
which go into a build.  Typically there is a makefile in a standard
place where the buildmaster can run something like "make all; make
install;" and be guaranteed that this will build the product.  The
build interface should be viewed as something which never changes and
 are part of the build machine, like the OS and are changed only
rarely.  It is hard enough to track all the parts of the build process
which we expect to change, we should not need to track complex build
procedures.  The build procedures should have a standard interface.
By keeping the build instructions in one makefile which is checked
into the same version control system as the sources it is easy to
recreate any previous build even if the commands used to build the
software fluctuate rapidly between releases.  There must be a simple
interface to construct the software which will hide all the complexity
of the actual construction.  

*) Build Environment: The makefile will code all the build commands
and all the environmental variables (PATH, UMASK, LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
CLASSPATH) needed to build the software though it may rely on some
well defined command line arguments (PREFIX, CCFLAGS, JAVA_LIBS) to
make these prematurely.  These command line arguments should not
change between versions of the software but should be a fixed set of
build parameters.  The parameters may be needed to specify where some
files are found on the build machine (Ideally the build machine is set
up the same as developers machines so these directories can be
hard-coded into the makefiles but often there is a need for some
directories to be specified at build time) or where files are to be
created/installed on the build machine (typically a subdirectory of
/var/tmp but there may be several builds running at once and each will
need a different directory) or what kind of build is being created.
Each part of the build which needs a particular environmental variable
set or a special header file in some path should have tests which
ensure that the build environment is valid.  I keep my build scripts
installed on the build machine and they are always started by running
/etc/rc.d/init.d/build start this ensures that I am not relying on any
build environmental variables which are set by logging into the build
account and are thus not tracked and versioned.

*) Environmental safety issues: 

If the build environment can not be used to build the software then a
human readable error message should be generated.  My makefiles often
run various checks on the environmental variables before they
construct the code.  They check that all required environmental
variables are set, that the required libraries are found, that
directories which must be disjoint (build and install directories) do
not overlap. This test suite becomes a build regression test and as I
discover additional possible build problems I add new tests to the
makefile.  I make it a habit to explicit set all environmental
variables so that there is no doubt as to their expected values.  It
is important for the QA group to only use Builds which were created by
an automated process so that we are sure that there are no
undocumented steps in either the test builds or the released build.

3) Track the Build numbers.  Given a clean install of your product you
should have all the information necessary to reproduce the executable
from sources.  If a customer shows you the application binaries you
must be able to get the source code which build the application,
reconstruct the build machine which created the application and
possibly rerun the build exactly the same way as the application was
created before, this may include making some minor source code changes
before the build is run. I like to keep a file which contains:

	The product release name

	The sources 'as of date'. (I always checkout my sources using
		cvs -D 'date time' so that exactly the same sources
		can be recovered knowing only the 'data time' which
		was used to check them out. I am sure a similar trick
		could be used with a perforce 'change set number'.)

	The branch name.

	The module name.

This can be stored as a file in the product (encrypted if necessary)
or may be stored in some secure build master database where the data
can be looked up by release name.  My preference is to keep all data
necessary to reproduce a build in the build output and delivered as
part of the product.  This means that I can generate as many builds as
I want automatically and not need to keep track of any of them.  When
the QA team deems that a certain build is 'important', by making a
particular build the official released copy then I can take a look at
its contents and tag/branch the code at the sources which I used to
build it.

4) Build Prefix: It is a good idea to familiarize yourself with the
makefile conventions regarding the make variable PREFIX.  It is
easiest to understand if you think about what RedHat does when they
build their distribution of RPM's but this will apply in many
different systems including the Andrew File System (AFS) and most
packaging systems. This variable is used during the build process
"make all PREFIX=/home/apache" to tell the package where it will be
installed (examples include /usr, /usr/local, /home/apache).  I
suggest reading a few RedHat Spec files to see how this works in
practice.  The application may need to hard-code this value into its
object code.  When the application is installed it must not be
installed into its proper place on the build machine.  The package we
are constructing could cause the build machine to stop working
correctly if it is a buggy version of a system library or major OS
application.  Instead the makefile will install "make install
PREFIX=/var/tmp/build-root/home/apache" the package into some other
directory with a similar tree structure to its final destination.  The
packaging system will then move the files into the correct place
during an installation step on the target machine.  The installation
step only moves files and sets permissions.  The makefile is not
supposed to use the installation directories to hard code values into
the application since the application will never be run from this
installation directory.  The hard part of the build including any
PREFIX magic is in the build section.  Notice the clear separation
between build machine / target machine and installation on the build
machine and installation on the target machine and construction of the
application binaries and installation of the application binaries.
This is one of the reasons why building an application on a build
machine is different from the way in which developers build their code
on their personal development machines.  This PREFIX issue will arise
when you try and build the Tinderbox system and also when you
construct the makefiles for your own application.  Since the build
machine is not the target machine it can not be assumed that files
will always be in the same places on both (for example perl).

5) Application Architecture: 

*) The build process should mimic the architecture of the code.  It should
be a final test that the code was coded to the same specifications
that it was designed.  It is a common problem for code to turn into
spaghetti with each piece of code using functions and creating
dependencies on every other piece of code.  For example it is probably
a mistake for code in the database abstraction layer to be implemented
in terms of code in the HTML generation layer.  These two libraries
should probably be independent of each other, though they both might
depend on a common string library.  The code architecture should limit
the dependency graph between code modules.  The BuildMaster must
enforce the restrictions on information flow between components. Thus
no libraries should be in the path unless the architecture allows this
module to depend on those libraries.

*) The architecture must not have circular dependencies.  Circular
dependencies not only make upgrading individual libraries difficult
but also make testing components nearly impossible.  That is it should
be possible to build some set of libraries L0 which depend on no
libraries and then build some other set of libraries L1 which depend
only on L0 libraries then build L2 which depend only on the L0 and L1
libraries.  This "build chain" will prevent circular dependencies and
help keep your code testable and the dependencies understandable.
More information about why this is a good practice is available in
"Large-Scale C++ Software Design" (Addison-Wesley Professional
Computing Series) by John Lakos

*) I enforce the convention that developers are not allowed to overload
standard system libraries.  I always put standard libraries in the
path before any library our company develops.  I build the application
in stages to ensure that parts of the application which are not
intended to depend on other code will not have other header files on
the build machine at the time that they are constructed.  Build
dependencies between modules which are expected are explicitly
controlled with build scripts and version numbers.
