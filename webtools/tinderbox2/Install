Tinderbox Documentation:
------------------------

*) Every directory has a ReadMe file which tells about all the files
in that directory.

*) Every executable can be run with --help so that you can see what
the program does and what its arguments are.  If you have trouble
running the file just look at the file in a text editor and find
the string "usage".

*) The top of every file (both code and configuration) has a short
explanation of what this file does.

*) The code has lots of documentation so you can read the code if you
need more details about how something works.


To install:
-----------


*) You will need to ensure that Perl is installed on your webserver.
It would be a good idea to have these modules installed:
	 Storable, Date::Format,

You can easily check if these are installed by executing these two
commands.

If the module is installed, you'll get no output:
	 perl -e 'use Storable'
	 perl -e 'use Date::Format'
 


*) Read the Policies and Overview documents found in this directory to
help you get a feel for the scope of this installation.

*) The process id which receives and process the mail must be the
same id which runs the tinderbox cron job to prepare the web pages.  I
prefer to manage my webserver so that all CGI scripts do not run as
the same user.  Using one user id can cause security problems which
are hard to detect.  If you must run all web applications as a single
user it would be safer to ensure that this user is a specific web user
(apache, cgiuser, webuser) so that this is not mixed up with other
unix system users (daemon, nobody, bin) since this could cause
security interactions with other programs which use these ids.

It may take some thought as to how the user id will be configured to
run when receiving mail and when receiving web requests and not be a
user id which will cause security problems.

These products will help partition your web application to run as
different users. (See http://www.w3.org/Security/Faq/wwwsf4.html for
more info)

The Apache Web server comes with its own wrapper script called suEXEC.

*) The src/default_conf directory contains perl libraries which are
specific to an individual users site configuration.  No two users of
Tinderbox will have the identical sets of files.

The files found in default_conf are sample files which are used at
Mozilla.org.  Other users are expected to customize these libraries and
install the modified libraries in local_conf.  Files found in
local_conf will be used before any file found in default_conf.
The distribution of Tinderbox will never place any files in the
local_conf directory as this is assumed to be under local control.

A quick overview of the files:

	TinderConfig.pm: general configuration settings 
		(HTML directories, Log files, implementations of libraries 
		 to use, etc).
	TreeData.pm: version control (CVS, Bonsai) configuration.
	Error_Parse.pm: the regular expressions for identifying
		 errors in build logs.
	BTData.pm: bug tracking configuration
	FileStructure.pm: filesystem (storage) and global/per-project 
		settings. Most users will not have to change this.


In particular you will need a TinderConfig.pm and a TreeData.pm which
describes your local setup.  You may need to make local versions of
the other files depending on how you wish to have Tinderbox configured.

I install Tinderbox via RPM.  I have three RPMS. One tracks changes in
the Tinderbox server source code just as I get it from CVS. One RPM
contains my local_conf files.  The clientbin files get put in their
own RPM which is installed on the buildmachine along with the
local_conf files.  I do not currently have all the other configuration
details worked out (crontab files, /etc/rc.d/init.d, .cvspass,) but
most of the state of my machines is under RPM control.

*) Run ./configure. When configure is done you will have a Makefile
and a config.out.  Although Tinderbox consists entirely of perl
scripts we must substitute some values into the source code to make it
executable.  You may wish to change the default directories in
configure for some of the makefile variables.  Please read config.out
and make any changes which need to be made for your system. Configure
also accepts command line options to change some default variables.
Please look at the configure source code for variable details, but the
most common changes are:

	--prefix: the directory for most of the tinderbox files,
		defaults to /home/tinderbox2

	--cgibin-prefix: The directory where cgi scripts will be
		run. This depends on how your webserver is configured.  
		For security you may wish to ensure that this
		directory is disjoint from the prefix directory.  This
		defaults to /var/www/cgi-bin/tinderbox.

	--html-prefix: The directory where html files should be
		written. This depends on how your webserver is configured. 
		This is where the webserver will pick up tinderbox2
		output.  This defaults to /home/httpd/html/tinderbox.


*) run 'make' to create executable versions of the source code in the
./build directory.

*) run 'make compile_bin_code' to ensure that the code will compile
when it is installed.  This will not work if your target machine is
very different from the machine you are running make on.

*) If you wish run the test programs as described in
/build/test/ReadMe to ensure that you have configured the program
correctly. This will require a TinderConfig.pm file in your local_conf
directory.  See the ReadMe file in the test directory for detailed
information on how the tests work.

*) run make install, to install Tinderbox on your system.  You may
wish to run this with a different 'prefix'

	make install --prefix=/opt/tinderbox

It is currently assumed that the bin directory of your installation
will be where the webserver will run the tinderbox cgi's from.  You
can copy the *.cgi files to another directory if this is not the case.

*) There are some gifs located in the gif directory which have
historically been used by tinderbox.  The installation via 'make
install' does not install these images.  Put them somewhere in your
webserver's html directory if you wish to use them.  Samples of their
use are in the configuration files.

*) set up a cron job to run $cgi-bin/bin/tinder.cgi --daemon-mode 
	every five minutes.  This generates the static tinderbox pages
	which users see.
   set up a cron job to run $prefix/bin/rmlogs at least once a day.
     six am is a good time to run this as the machine load is usually light
      and will avoids any day light savings problems.  This keeps the
	archive of compressed build logs from growing without limit.

*) you may recieve data into the $prefix/bin/processmail* programs via
http post. Typically this means that these programs must be installed
in the $cgi-bin directory and have a name which ends in *.cgi. Instead
of mailling the logs to these programs, use the HTTPPost program to
post the data to the correct URL.

*) If using the mail system, set up the $prefix/bin/processmail*
programs to receive the incoming tinderbox mail.  The process id which
receives and process the mail must be the the same id which runs the
tinderbox cron job to prepare the web pages.  Usually this set up is
accomplished by having the MTA (Sendmail) pass mail for particular
accounts into a script.  This can be configured via a global
configuration file (Sendmail alias file) or via a .forward file (each
account gets the same user id but a different home directory, each
home directory gets a .forward to cause incoming mail to be delivered
through the correct tinderbox mail processing program).

I have used the following configurations for the mail server Postfix.
The postfix aliases file /etc/postfix/aliases contains the following
lines.  This file must be processed with a /usr/sbin/postalias command
which must be run by the same id which will run the tinderbox cgi scripts.

	tinderbox_builds: |/home/tinderbox2/bin/processmail_builds
	tinderbox_bugzilla: |/home/tinderbox2/bin/processmail_bugs



If it is not possible to have mail delivery on your web machine and to
have your web machine deliver specific mail through a program then I
suggest you use fetchmail to simulate this delivery format.  Download
fetchmail (from http://tuxedo.org/~esr/fetchmail) and install it on
your webserver.  Have the mail sent to any pop/imap mail server which
is accessible from the webserver.  Configure fetchmail to gather the
mail from the mail server and pass it through to the correct mail
processing program.  You should keep the polling interval short (30-200
seconds) as long polling intervals will cause delays in the tinderbox
system and limit how quickly users see the new data.  If the polling
interval is too short then you will overload your pop server with
needless queries.  Fetchmail should run under the same id as the
tinderbox server.  The fetchmail configuration file will look
something like:

	poll mail.provider.net with proto pop3:
               user "tinderbox_builds" there has password "u can't krak this"
               is tinder here and wants mda "$prefix/bin/processmail_builds"




We use the mail address 'tinderbox_builds' for build information
destined for the webserver. Similarly the bug tracking system should
send mail to 'tinderbox_bugs'.


*) Make sure that when tinderbox runs it has all the permissions that
it needs to access the Version Control database.  This usually means
having an environmental variable set when tinderbox is run from
cron. If you are using VC_CVS.pm then you will need to put a
~/.cvspass for the tinderbox server to use.  To create this file you
will need to Log into the CVS repository yourself, once for each tree
you have defined.  The login command must use the hostname/modules
exactly as you wrote it in VCData.  Then copy your ~/.cvspass into the
tinderbox server user id's home directory.  This must be the REAL home
of the Tinderbox daemon, as listed in /etc/passwd/ and set in the
$HOME environmental variable for tinder.cgi.  The file must not be
world readable or writable or executable. It is recommended that
VC_CVS.pm is only used as an interim step in setting up
VC_Bonsai. VC_Bonsai is not hard to setup and provided many useful
features which are absent in VC_CVS.pm.


*) Setup the build machines to mail their build logs (with tinderbox
variables on the top) to the web server machine.  New builds must not
start earlier then 6 minutes after the last build started.  Each build
machine mails the build log of each build and puts some build data at
the top of the log.  Build information includes whether the build was
a success, which error parsers to use on the log file and what build
this is.  Run 'processmail_builds --help' to learn about how the mail
processing system works and what the mail messages are expected to
look like.  There is an example mail in the test directory called
samplelog.  The clientbin directory contains code which can be used on
the buildmachine.  See the README to help setup your buildmachine.

http://www.ntsendmail.com/ has a perl program which can be used to
send mail on systems where there is no sendmail installed.

There is nothing special about sending mail.  Any data transport layer
would work including HTTP Post and SSH the only requirement is that
the data is sent to the STDIN of the mail processing programs upon
delivery and that the process which runs this is the same uid as the
tinderbox server. I have not thought too much about how to set up
these alternate delivery mechanisms so I have no practical advice but
It should not be too hard to setup. There is a set of instructions for
this in lwpcook.pod which suggest you will need to install
HTTP::Request::Common and LWP::UserAgent;

*) Set up the bug tracking system to send mail to 'tinderbox_bugs' on
the webserver machine whenever a Bug ticket changes state. It is not
interesting to see which tickets are being worked on, so restrict
mailing to changes in ticket state not updates (edit) of a ticket.

*) Check that the time on your webserver, your version control
machine, your bug tracking machine and your build machines are all in
sync.  Check that mail if build mail bounces on any of the above
machines that it will be received by someone who can act on it.
