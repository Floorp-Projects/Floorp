    fixed minor spelling mistake s/Regnerate/Regenerate/
    bug 231057 reported by David Costanzo

New Time columns for use in environments with multiple time zones.

Spelling fixes 

Add support for popup windows which work "on click"

Add support for users who want to see tinderbox's notion of what was
checked in not just Bonsai's query.	

Add support for historical Tinderbox images
	(flames, stars)

Mozilla layout preferences are now 
standard 
(non uniform row spacing, 
 truly empty cells, 
 legend on bottom of page).
	
Allow users to backdate notices

automate regeneration of HTML when user uses CGI 
interface
	
Put the C in all build cells.

VC code did the wrong thing when generating old pages and there was
no TreeState data.

Fix Spelling mistakes throughout code.	
	
Add support for build machines to tell the server to add text/links 
into build cells (TinderboxPrint).

When builds are started too frequently (more then once every five minutes) 
newest build is now kept and oldest build is thrown away.
	
New Configure script contributed by Stephen Lamm (slamm@yahoo-inc.com)
This includes a fix to allow Perl to be in different locations on the 
machine where make is run and on the machine where the webserver runs.
	
Now it is possible to include the time column on the left and right 
side of the status table.

There is now a working Perforce module for those who use this product
instead of CVS.

There is a module to interface with the req ticketing system.
	
New Summary format and number of errors displayed on build page by
        Adam Di Carlo <adam@onshore-devel.com>,

Spelling and consistency fixes from:
	Adam Di Carlo <adam@onshore-devel.com>, 
	Orion Poplawski <OPoplawski@cqg.com>,
	John L. Villanlovos <john.l.villalovos@intel.com>,

Change HTML generation so that the text browser 'links' 
(http://artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~mikulas/links/) can
work with tinderbox.

Allow the build script to use a single process and alternate builds 
of different types.

Add a sample /etc/rc.d/init.d file for the RedHat Build machines.

Mail processing programs were not writing error files correctly.  
This has been broken since I separated out the mail processing module.

Add script to cull old builds from a directory of completed builds.

Let the VC and BT headers be configurable.  Too many companies find
this an important feature.

Allow Tinderbox to run via suid wrappers.  This is needed for some
times of mail delivery systems
	
No longer exclude 'privileged id's from running Tinderbox. 
Now we require tinderbox to run as the id which the user specifies 
is the tinderbox id.

Better errors for failures in Storable.pm

BasicTxtHeader.pm had a bug which prevented it from working when using Storable

Rework the BT modules to allow use when URL is not easily mapped from the bugid

Begin work to allow tinderbox admin pages to open and close bonsai trees

fix code which allowed tinderbox to determine the state of bonsai trees

Major bug in the untainting code, fixed. This was a security
problem. I suspect people may have trouble with the fix but this was
how the code was intended to work.  I do not understand how this got
through my unit tests.

Give a useful example of how use the new build script.

Improve the specfiles, split out build machine packages.


Release 0.9

Add full Bonsai integration functionality.

Allow users to define a display order for the buildnames on a per tree basis.
This adds a new function into TreeData.pm check your local files.
	
Fix computation of 'deadtime' for eazel.com's build setup,
	this will improve their estimate of when the next build will be
	complete.

Develop portable client build scripts.

Add RPM specfiles.

Relax check of root id for all redhat users.  
	uid nobody is 99 and by default redhat apache runs all cgi as nobody.

VC_CVS.pm was not removing excess treestates from the Database correctly, 
		now fixed.
	
Release 0.8

This release moved some files into new directories update with
	cvs update -d -P

Remove the strict time checking on mail, it caused too many problems.

Fix the Unmonitored Builds in admintree.cgi and in status.html page.

Storable.pm has been tested as a Persistence implementation.

Improve the prediction of when builds will end by introducing the
notion of 'deadtime'.

Separate out the BuildStatus table for easier configuration of the
status without changing the build display library.

Better comments in the ReadMe files

Better security:

	All scripts run in taint perl mode

	Separation of HTML and DATA directories in 
		addition to the CGI directory

	Additional checks of ownership for the data directories

	Check the network address of all administrative commands

Improved Makefile/Configure support

	New permissions help prevent accidental edit of files in the
		build or install directory

	Interpositioning of libraries, for local configuration,
		fully supported

	Test arguments added to Makefile

	Test compiles of the perl are no longer required
