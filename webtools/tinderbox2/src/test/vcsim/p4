# p4 - simulate the output of the sequence of commands:
# 		p4 changes -s submitted  @2003/05/11,@now
#		p4 describe -s 567 568 569
# So that I can debug tinderbox on machines where this
# program is not installed.

# We need to associate date/times with change numbers and have these
# be persistent between calls.  If these pairs were randomly generated
# it would totally destroy the data structures used in VC_Perforce.
# WE do not need to keep the same user/comments/files/jobs between
# calls.  Just fudge up something which looks good to the eye.  The
# date/times with change numbers pairs are created and stored in a
# file every time the change command is run.  The file is used by the
# describe command to ensure consistency between changenumber
# date/time pairs.
