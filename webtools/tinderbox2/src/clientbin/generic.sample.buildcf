# generic.sample.buildcf - this is an example buildcf which should be
# useful to most people.  Your needs may be different from this script
# especially if you are running builds on many different OS and platforms
# which require different command sequences.  Each build type
# (construct, test, lint) defines a sequence of commands which is the
# same on all build machines.  They types each have different commands
# to run but the commands are simple because all the difficult work is
# performed inside makefiles and shell scripts.  There is one parser
# on the tinderbox server for each type of build.  This cf file will
# need a copy of the TreeData file on the build machine in order to
# translate the treename into the name of the module and branch and
# correctly set the CVSROOT environment variable.

# Run:

#	./build_shellscript	--buildcf ./generic.sample.buildcf	\
#				--build construct --test 		\
#					-- 				\
#				--tree seamonkey

# to see the completed build script which has all the perl
# variables substituted.

# builds describe a sequence of steps needed to perform a "build".
# Each build either succeeds or fails.  Builds can be used for running
# tests and checking source code style in addition to creating binaries.

# Builds may depend on the environment, the OS or special arguments
# passed to the program.  Arguments which are passed after the '--'
# are assumed to be build specific and are ignored by the build
# harness and can be used in defining the build sequence.

# Builds can be architecture dependent (one build name can be used for
# all architectures) or independent (each OS uses a different
# buildname) depending on your application.


# each build can have as many phases as
# are needed (sample: checkout, configure, build, test)


# Each phase must have the following entries:

#	 phase_name: which describes what the phase is.

#	 error_status: the tinderbox status which should be returned
#	 if the phase fails.

#	 script: a list of shell commands to be executed in order
#	 until one fails (each command in a separate shell, similar to make).

#	 dir: the directory which will be local while the script is
#	 executing.
