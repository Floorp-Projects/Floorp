To use Doctor, first configure it by copying sample.conf to doctor.conf
and editing doctor.conf according to the instructions in it.

Then make sure you have the Template, AppConfig, File::Temp, Text::Diff,
Email::Valid, and MIME::Entity modules (and their dependencies), which you
can get via CPAN:

perl -MCPAN -e"install Template, AppConfig, File::Temp, Text::Diff, Email::Valid, and MIME::Entity"

Then configure your web server to serve Doctor files correctly.  See the
.htaccess file for an explanation of the configuration options, but note that
you should add the options to the global Apache configuration file if you have
access to it since the global file is much more performant than .htaccess.

Finally, put the doctor/ directory into your web server's cgi-bin/ directory
(or another location where you can run CGI scripts) and browse to doctor.cgi.

You may want to edit the templates in the templates/ subdirectory to refer
to your own website instead of the mozilla.org website.
