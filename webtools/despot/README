This is Despot, mozilla.org's system of managing users.

Maybe you'll find it useful, but for now, we're just concentrating on
developing it for our own needs.

So don't expect a lot of help from us in understanding this code...

---------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION: 

See the Bugzilla README; you'll need to install at least MySQL, Perl,
and the MySQL-related Perl module collection as documented there.
You'll need a relatively new version of MySQL: 3.20.32a is known not
work; 3.22.32 is.

You'll may also need to build a version of CVS with the patch in
cvs_user.patch applied.  I found cvs_user.patch in archives on the
net; unfortunately I didn't keep track of where.  However, the CVS 
repository for CVS itself now has this patch applied, so if your 
copy of CVS is new enough, this may not be necessary.  

# create a database called mozusers:

mysqladmin -p create mozusers

# create the tables

./maketables.sh

# insert a user with despot powers (probably yourself) and a daemon
# user (for despot to do updates and synchronization) into the users
# table of the mozusers database.

mysql mozusers

mysql> insert users set id=1, email="dmose@mozilla.org", 
	realname="Dan Mosedale", passwd="", 
	gila_group="cvsadm", cvs_group="cvsadm", despot="Yes", 
	neednewpassword="Yes", disabled="No", voucher=1, 
	signedform="No";

mysql> insert users set id=2, email="despotdaemon@foo.com", 
	realname="The Despot Daemon", passwd="", 
	gila_group="cvsadm", cvs_group="cvsadm", despot="No", 
	neednewpassword="Yes", disabled="No", voucher=1, 
	signedform="No";

# go to the webserver where you've got this set up and change the
# passwords for both of these accounts

# get anoncvs from the friedman-branch-openbsd-rel-1997-10-13
# branch.  edit as appropriate, build, and install cvspserversh.

# on the cvs servers, create a cvsadm group, and a cvsadm user in that 
# group.  they should both have a shell of cvspserversh.

# set up 2 cvs repositories, 

cvs -d /path/to/repos1 init
cvs -d /path/to/repos2 init

# create a passwd file in both CVSROOT directories and add a user in
# both places that the despotdaemon will use to do its checkins.
# the file will contain a single line that looks just like the
# following.  the first field should be an email address with @ replaced by
# %, and the second field is an already crypt()ed representation of a
# password, just like the one used in /etc/passwd.  the third field is 
# the unix group (this group needs to have write access to the
# CVSROOT/passwd files.  (don't use foo.com; use a working email address at
# your local site)

despotdaemon%foo.com:$1$2Zjkl2kjjgvGGapOsss7CLmocwX620:cvsadm

# make sure the repositories are owned by the cvsadm user
# and group.  turn on the setgid bit on all directories for appropriate
# group inheritance semantics (assuming your unix supports this).

# create binary ,v files by doing an RCS checkin of the files in both places.  
# note that there are problems using the passwd strings from /etc/shadow 
# on linux.  the strings from /etc/shadow on solaris 2.6 machines seem to work
# however.
