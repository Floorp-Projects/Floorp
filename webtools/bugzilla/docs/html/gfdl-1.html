>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</H1
><P
>This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under
    the terms of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any such
    manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed
    as "you".</P
><P
>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
    Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
    modifications and/or translated into another language.</P
><P
>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
    of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
    publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
    (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
    within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a
    textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
    mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection
    with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.</P
><P
>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
    titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this License.</P
><P
>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
    listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says
    that the Document is released under this License.</P
><P
>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
    represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
    public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
    straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
    pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
    drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
    automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
    markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification
    by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
    "Opaque".</P
><P
>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
    ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
    XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML
    designed for human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF,
    proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word
    processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not
    generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.</P
><P
>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
    plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
    this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats
    which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text
    near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
    beginning of the body of the text.</P
