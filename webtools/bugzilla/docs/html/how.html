      requires some time.  If you are only interested in installing or
      administering a Bugzilla installation, please consult the
      Installing and Administering Bugzilla portions of this Guide.
      This section is principally aimed towards developing end-user

      Bugzilla, it does not offer all the options you would have as a
      user on your own installation of Bugzilla, nor can it do more
      than serve as a general introduction to Bugzilla.  Additionally,
      Landfill often runs cutting-edge versions of Bugzilla for
      testing, so some things may work slightly differently than
      mentioned here.

	    our Bugzilla database. Please notice the box is a

		  subsequent tenths of a digit.  In most cases, it's

>	    A "Milestone", or "Target Milestone" is a often a planned
	    future "Version" of a product.  In many cases, though,
	    Milestones simply represent significant dates for a
	    developer.  Having certain features in your Product is
	    frequently tied to revenue (money) the developer will
	    receive if the features work by the time she  reaches the
	    Target Milestone. Target Milestones are a great tool to
	    organize your time. If someone will pay you $100,000 for
	    incorporating certain features by a certain date, those
	    features by that Milestone date become a very high
	    priority.  Milestones tend to be highly malleable
	    creatures, though, that appear to be in reach but are out
	    of reach by the time the important day arrives.

></H3
><P
>	  Before we plunge into writing your first bug report, I
	  encourage you to read some bug-writing guidelines.  If you
	  are reading this document as part of a Bugzilla CVS checkout
	  or un-tarred Bugzilla distribution, you should be able to
	  read them by clicking <A
HREF="../../bugwritinghelp.html"
TARGET="_top"
>here</A
>.  If you are reading this online, check out the Mozilla.org bug-writing guidelines at <A
HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/quality/bug-writing-guidelines.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.mozilla.org/quality/bug-writing-guidelines.html</A
>.  While some of the advice is Mozilla-specific, the basic principles of reporting Reproducible, Specific bugs, isolating the Product you are using, the Version of the Product, the Component which failed, the Hardware Platform, and Operating System you were using at the time of the failure go a long way toward ensuring accurate, responsible fixes for the bug that bit you.
	</P
><P
>	  While you are at it, why not learn how to find previously
	  reported bugs?  Mozilla.org has published a great tutorial
	  on finding duplicate bugs, available at <A
HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/quality/help/beginning-duplicate-finding.html"
TARGET="_top"
> http://www.mozilla.org/quality/help/beginning-duplicate-finding.html</A
>.
	</P
><P
>	  I realize this was a lot to read.  However, understanding
	  the mentality of writing great bug reports will help us on
	  the next part!

>	  You have now learned the basics of Bugzilla navigation,
	  entering a bug, and bug maintenance. I encourage you to
	  explore these features, and see what you can do with them!
	  We'll spend no more time on individual Bugs or Queries from
	  this point on, so you are on your own there.
	</P

>	  But I'll give a few last hints!
	</P
><P
>	  There is a <A
HREF="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/help.html"
TARGET="_top"
>CLUE</A
> on the Query page that will teach you more how to use the form.
	</P
><P
>	  If you click the hyperlink on the <A
HREF="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi"
TARGET="_top"
>Component</A
> box of the Query page, you will be presented a form that will describe what all the components are.
	</P
><P
>	  Possibly the most powerful feature of the Query page is the
	  <A
HREF="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/booleanchart.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Boolean Chart</A
> section. It's a bit confusing to use the first time, but can provide unparalleled flexibility in your queries, allowing you to build extremely powerful requests.
	</P
><P
>	  Finally, you can build some nifty  <A
HREF="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/reports.cgi"
TARGET="_top"
>Reports</A
> using the "Bug Reports" link near the bottom of the query page, and also available via the "Reports" link at the footer of each page.
