>3.2.1. Autolinkification</H2
><P
>Bugzilla comments are plain text - so posting HTML will result
      in literal HTML tags rather than being interpreted by a browser.
      However, Bugzilla will automatically make hyperlinks out of certain
      sorts of text in comments. For example, the text 
      http://www.bugzilla.org will be turned into
      <A
HREF="http://www.bugzilla.org"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.bugzilla.org</A
>.
      Other strings which get linkified in the obvious manner are:

>A corollary here is that if you type a bug number in a comment,
      you should put the word "bug" before it, so it gets autolinkified
      for the convenience of others.

>3.2.2. Quicksearch</H2
><P
>Quicksearch is a single-text-box query tool which uses
      metacharacters to indicate what is to be searched. For example, typing
      "<TT
CLASS="filename"
>foo|bar</TT
>" 
      into Quicksearch would search for "foo" or "bar" in the 
      summary and status whiteboard of a bug; adding 
      "<TT
CLASS="filename"
>:BazProduct</TT
>" would
      search only in that product.

      front page, along with a

>3.2.3. Comments</H2
><P
>If you are changing the fields on a bug, only comment if
      either you have something pertinent to say, or Bugzilla requires it.
      Otherwise, you may spam people unnecessarily with bug mail.
      To take an example: a user can set up their account to filter out messages
      where someone just adds themselves to the CC field of a bug
      (which happens a lot.) If you come along, add yourself to the CC field,
      and add a comment saying "Adding self to CC", then that person
      gets a pointless piece of mail they would otherwise have avoided.
      </P
><P
>&#13;      Don't use sigs in comments. Signing your name ("Bill") is acceptable,
      particularly if you do it out of habit, but full mail/news-style
      four line ASCII art creations are not.

>3.2.4. Attachments</H2
><P
>&#13;      Use attachments, rather than comments, for large chunks of ASCII data,
      such as trace, debugging output files, or log files. That way, it doesn't
      bloat the bug for everyone who wants to read it, and cause people to
      receive fat, useless mails.
      </P
><P
>Trim screenshots. There's no need to show the whole screen if
      you are pointing out a single-pixel problem.
      </P
><P
>Don't attach simple test cases (e.g. one HTML file, one 
      CSS file and an image) as a ZIP file. Instead, upload them in 
      reverse order and edit the referring file so that they point to the
      attached files. This way, the test case works immediately 
      out of the bug.

>Try to make sure that everything said in the summary is also 
      said in the first comment. Summaries are often updated and this will
      ensure your original information is easily accessible.

>&#13;      You do not need to put "any" or similar strings in the URL field.
      If there is no specific URL associated with the bug, leave this 
      field blank.

>If you feel a bug you filed was incorrectly marked as a
      DUPLICATE of another, please question it in your bug, not      
      the bug it was duped to. Feel free to CC the person who duped it 
      if they are not already CCed.
