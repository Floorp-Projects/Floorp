>	  Groups in Bugzilla are a complicated beast that evolved out
	  of very simple user permission bitmasks, apparently itself
	  derived from common concepts in UNIX access controls.  A
	  "bitmask" is a fixed-length number whose value can describe
	  one, and only one, set of states.  For instance, UNIX file
	  permissions are assigned bitmask values:  "execute" has a
	  value of 1, "write" has a value of 2,  and "read" has a
	  value of 4.  Add them together, and a file can be read,
	  written to, and executed if it has a bitmask of "7". (This
	  is a simplified example -- anybody who knows UNIX security
	  knows there is much more to it than this.  Please bear with
	  me for the purpose of this note.)  The only way a bitmask
	  scheme can work is by doubling the bit count for each value.
	  Thus if UNIX wanted to offer another file permission, the
	  next would have to be a value of 8, then the next 16, the
	  next 32, etc.
	</P
><P
>	  Similarly, Bugzilla offers a bitmask to define group
	  permissions, with an internal limit of 64.  Several are
	  already occupied by built-in permissions.  The way around
	  this limitation is to avoid assigning groups to products if
	  you have many products, avoid bloating of group lists, and
	  religiously prune irrelevant groups.  In reality, most
	  installations of Bugzilla support far fewer than 64 groups,
	  so this limitation has not hit for most sites, but it is on
	  the table to be revised for Bugzilla 3.0 because it
	  interferes with the security schemes of some administrators.
