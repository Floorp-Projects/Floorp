    <title>Bonsai</title>
    <para>Bonsai is a web-based tool for managing <xref
							linkend="cvs" />
      .  Using Bonsai, administrators can control open/closed status
      of trees, query a fast relational database back-end for change,
      branch, and comment information, and view changes made since the
      last time the tree was closed.  These kinds of changes cause the
      engineer responsible to be <quote>on the hook</quote> (include
      cool URL link here for Hook policies at mozilla.org).  Bonsai
      also includes gateways to <xref
								       linkend="tinderbox" /> and Bugzilla </para>

    <title>CVS</title>
    <para>CVS integration is best accomplished, at this point, using
      the Bugzilla Email Gateway.  There have been some files
      submitted to allow greater CVS integration, but we need to make
      certain that Bugzilla is not tied into one particular software
      management package.</para>
    <para>
      Follow the instructions in the FAQ for enabling Bugzilla e-mail
      integration.  Ensure that your check-in script sends an email to
      your Bugzilla e-mail gateway with the subject of <quote>[Bug
	XXXX]</quote>, and you can have CVS check-in comments append
      to your Bugzilla bug.  If you have your check-in script include
      an @resolution field, you can even change the Bugzilla bug
      state.
    </para>
    <para>
      There is also a project, based upon somewhat dated Bugzilla
      code, to integrate CVS and Bugzilla through CVS' ability to
      email.  Check it out at:
      <ulink url="http://homepages.kcbbs.gen.nz/~tonyg/">
      http://homepages.kcbbs.gen.nz/~tonyg/</ulink>, under the
      <quote>cvszilla</quote> link.

      You can find the project page for Bugzilla and Teamtrack
      Perforce integration (p4dti) at: <ulink
					      url="http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/p4dti/"> http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/p4dti</ulink> .  <quote>p4dti</quote> is now an officially supported product from Perforce, and you can find the "Perforce Public Depot" p4dti page at <ulink url="http://public.perforce.com/public/perforce/p4dti/index.html"> http://public.perforce.com/public/perforce/p4dti/index.html</ulink>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Integration of Perforce with Bugzilla, once patches are applied,
      is seamless.  Perforce replication information will appear below
      the comments of each bug.  Be certain you have a matching set of
      patches for the Bugzilla version you are installing.  p4dti is
      designed to support multiple defect trackers, and maintains its
      own documentation for it. Please consult the pages linked above
      for further information.
