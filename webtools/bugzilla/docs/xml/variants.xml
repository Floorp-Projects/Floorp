  <title>Bugzilla Variants and Competitors</title>

  <para>I created this section to answer questions about Bugzilla competitors
  and variants, then found a wonderful site which covers an awful lot of what
  I wanted to discuss. Rather than quote it in its entirety, I'll simply
  refer you here:

    <title>Red Hat Bugzilla</title>

    <para>Red Hat's old fork of Bugzilla which was based on version 2.8 is now
    obsolete.  The newest version in use is based on version 2.17.1 and is in
    the process of being integrated into the main Bugzilla source tree.  The
    back-end is modified to work with PostgreSQL instead of MySQL and they have
    custom templates to get their desired look and feel, but other than that it
    is Bugzilla 2.17.1.  Dave Lawrence of Red Hat put forth a great deal of
    effort to make sure that the changes he made could be integrated back into
    the main tree. 
    <ulink url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98304">Bug
    98304</ulink> exists to track this integration.

  <section id="variant-fenris" xreflabel="Loki Bugzilla, a.k.a. Fenris">
    <title>Loki Bugzilla (Fenris)</title>

    <para>Fenris was a fork from Bugzilla made by Loki Games; when
    Loki went into receivership, it died. While Loki's other code lives on,
    its custodians recommend Bugzilla for future bug-tracker deployments.

    <title>Issuezilla</title>

    <para>Issuezilla was another fork from Bugzilla, made by collab.net and
    hosted at tigris.org. It is also dead; the primary focus of bug-tracking 
    at tigris.org is their Java-based bug-tracker,

    <para>SourceForge is a way of coordinating geographically
