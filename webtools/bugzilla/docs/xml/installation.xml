	Bugzilla may be installed on Macintosh OS X (10), which is a
	unix-based (BSD)  operating system. Everything required for
	Bugzilla on OS X will install cleanly, but the optional GD

      <para>
	Bugzilla is not a package where you can just plop it in a directory,
	twiddle a few things, and you're off.  Installing Bugzilla assumes you
	know your variant of UNIX or Microsoft Windows well, are familiar with the
	command line, and are comfortable compiling and installing a plethora
	of third-party utilities.  To install Bugzilla on Win32 requires
	fair Perl proficiency, and if you use a webserver other than Apache you
	should be intimately familiar with the security mechanisms and CGI
	environment thereof.

      <para>
	Installation of bugzilla is pretty straightforward, particularly if your
	machine already has MySQL and the MySQL-related perl packages installed.
	If those aren't installed yet, then that's the first order of business.  The
	other necessary ingredient is a web server set up to run cgi scripts.
	While using Apache for your webserver is not required, it is recommended.

      <para>
	Visit MySQL homepage at <ulink
				       url="http://www.mysql.com">www.mysql.com</ulink> and grab the latest stable release of the server.  Many of the binary versions of MySQL store their data files in <filename>/var</filename> which is often part of a smaller root partition. If you decide to build from sources you can easily set the dataDir as an option to <filename>configure</filename>.
      </para>
      <para>
	If you install from source or non-package (RPM, deb, etc.)
	binaries you need to add
	<firstterm>mysqld</firstterm> to your
	init scripts so the server daemon will come back up whenever
	your machine reboots. Further discussion of UNIX init
	sequences are beyond the scope of this guide.
	<note>
	  <para>You should have your init script start
	    <glossterm>mysqld</glossterm> with the ability to accept
	    large packets. By default, <filename>mysqld</filename>
	    only accepts packets up to 64K long. This limits the size
	    of attachments you may put on bugs. If you add <option>-O
	    max_allowed_packet=1M</option> to the command that starts
	    <filename>mysqld</filename> (or
	    <filename>safe_mysqld</filename>), then you will be able

	<para>
	  If you plan on running Bugzilla and MySQL on the same

      <title>Perl (5.004 or greater)</title>
      <para>
	Any machine that doesn't have perl on it is a sad machine
	indeed.  Perl for *nix systems can be gotten in source form
	from http://www.perl.com.  Although Bugzilla runs with most
	post-5.004 versions of Perl, it's a good idea to be up to the
	very latest version if you can when running Bugzilla.  As of
	this writing, that is perl version &perl-ver;.
      </para>
      <para>
	Perl is now a far cry from the the single compiler/interpreter
	binary it once was.  It includes a great many required modules
	and quite a few other support files.  If you're not up to or
	not inclined to build perl from source, you'll want to install
	it on your machine using some sort of packaging system (be it
	RPM, deb, or what have you) to ensure a sane install. In the
	subsequent sections you'll be installing quite a few perl
	modules; this can be quite ornery if your perl installation
	isn't up to snuff.
      </para>
      <warning>
	<para>Many people complain that Perl modules will not install
	  for them.  Most times, the error messages complain that they
	  are missing a file in <quote>@INC</quote>.  Virtually every
	  time, this is due to permissions being set too restrictively
	  for you to compile Perl modules or not having the necessary
	  Perl development libraries installed on your system..
	  Consult your local UNIX systems administrator for help
	  solving these permissions issues; if you
	  <emphasis>are</emphasis> the local UNIX sysadmin, please
	  consult the newsgroup/mailing list for further assistance or

      <title>DBI Perl Module</title>
      <para>
	The DBI module is a generic Perl module used by other database related
	Perl modules.  For our purposes it's required by the MySQL-related
	modules.  As long as your Perl installation was done correctly the
	DBI module should be a breeze.  It's a mixed Perl/C module, but Perl's
	MakeMaker system simplifies the C compilation greatly.
      </para>
      <para>
	Like almost all Perl modules DBI can be found on the Comprehensive Perl
	Archive Network (CPAN) at http://www.cpan.org.  The CPAN servers have a
	real tendency to bog down, so please use mirrors.  The current location
	at the time of this writing can be found in <xref linkend="downloadlinks">.
      </para>
      <para>
	Quality, general Perl module installation instructions can be found on
	the CPAN website, but the easy thing to do is to just use the CPAN shell
	which does all the hard work for you.
      </para>
      <para>
	To use the CPAN shell to install DBI:
	<informalexample>
	  <para>
	    <computeroutput>

      <title>Data::Dumper Perl Module</title>
      <para>
	The Data::Dumper module provides data structure persistence for Perl
	(similar to Java's serialization).  It comes with later sub-releases of
	Perl 5.004, but a re-installation just to be sure it's available won't
	hurt anything.
      </para>
      <para>
	Data::Dumper is used by the MySQL-related Perl modules.  It
	can be found on CPAN (see <xref linkend="downloadlinks">) and
	can be
	installed by following the same four step make sequence used
	for the DBI module.

    <section>
      <title>MySQL related Perl Module Collection</title>
      <para>
	The Perl/MySQL interface requires a few mutually-dependent perl
	modules.  These modules are grouped together into the the
	Msql-Mysql-modules package.  This package can be found at CPAN.
	After the archive file has been downloaded it should
	be untarred.
      </para>
      <para>
	The MySQL modules are all built using one make file which is generated
	by running:
	<prompt>bash#</prompt>
	<command>perl Makefile.pl</command>
      </para>
      <para>
	The MakeMaker process will ask you a few questions about the desired
	compilation target and your MySQL installation.  For many of the questions
	the provided default will be adequate.
      </para>
      <para>
	When asked if your desired target is the MySQL or mSQL packages,
	select the MySQL related ones.  Later you will be asked if you wish
	to provide backwards compatibility with the older MySQL packages; you
	  should answer YES to this question. The default is NO.
	</para>
	<para>
	  A host of 'localhost' should be fine and a testing user of 'test' and
	  a null password should find itself with sufficient access to run tests
	  on the 'test' database which MySQL created upon installation.  If 'make
	  test' and 'make install' go through without errors you should be ready
	  to go as far as database connectivity is concerned.
	</para>
      </section>

      <section>
	<title>TimeDate Perl Module Collection</title>
	<para>
	  Many of the more common date/time/calendar related Perl
	modules have been grouped into a bundle similar to the MySQL
	modules bundle. This bundle is stored on the CPAN under the
	name TimeDate (see link: <xref linkend="downloadlinks">). The
	component module we're most interested in is the Date::Format
	module, but installing all of them is probably a good idea
	anyway.  The standard Perl module installation instructions
	should work perfectly for this simple package.
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>GD Perl Module (1.8.3)</title>
	<para>
	  The GD library was written by Thomas Boutell a long while
	ago to programatically generate images in C.  Since then it's
	become the defacto standard for programatic image
	construction.  The Perl bindings to it found in the GD library
	are used on millions of web pages to generate graphs on the
	fly. That's what bugzilla will be using it for so you must
	install it if you want any of the graphing to work.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Actually bugzilla uses the Graph module which relies on GD
	itself.  Isn't that always the way with object-oriented
	programming?  At any rate, you can find the GD library on CPAN
	in <xref linkend="downloadlinks">.  
	</para>
	<note>
	  <para>
	    The Perl GD library requires some other libraries that may
	  or may not be installed on your system, including
	  <classname>libpng</classname> and
	  <classname>libgd</classname>.  The full requirements are
	  listed in the Perl GD library README.  Just realize that if
	  compiling GD fails, it's probably because you're missing a
	  required library.
	  </para>
	</note>
      </section>

      <section>
	<title>Chart::Base Perl Module (0.99c)</title>
	<para>
	  The Chart module provides bugzilla with on-the-fly charting
	abilities.  It can be installed in the usual fashion after it
	has been fetched from CPAN where it is found as the
	Chart-x.x... tarball, linked in <xref linkend="downloadlinks">. Note that
	as with the GD perl module, only the version listed above, or
	newer, will work. Earlier versions used GIF's, which are no
	longer supported by the latest versions of GD.
	</para>
      </section>

      <section>
	<title>DB_File Perl Module</title>
	<para>
	  DB_File is a module which allows Perl programs to make use
	of the facilities provided by  Berkeley DB version 1.x. This
	module is required by collectstats.pl which is used for  bug
	charting. If you plan to make use of bug charting, you must
	install this module.
	</para>
      </section>

      <section>
	<title>HTTP Server</title>
	<para>
	  You have a freedom of choice here - Apache, Netscape or any
	other server on UNIX would do.  You can easily run the web
	server on a different machine than MySQL, but need to adjust
	the MySQL <quote>bugs</quote> user permissions accordingly.
	<note>
	  <para>I strongly recommend Apache as the web server to use.
	    The Bugzilla Guide installation instructions, in general,
	    assume you are using Apache.  As more users use different
	    webservers and send me information on the peculiarities of
	    installing using their favorite webserver, I will provide
	    notes for them.</para>
	</note>
	</para>
	<para>
	  You'll want to make sure that your web server will run any
	file with the .cgi extension as a cgi and not just display it.
	If you're using apache that means uncommenting the following
	line in the srm.conf file:
	<programlisting>
AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
	</programlisting>
	</para>
	<para>
	  With apache you'll also want to make sure that within the
	access.conf file the line:
 <programlisting>
Options ExecCGI
</programlisting>
	is in the stanza that covers the directories into which
	you intend to put the bugzilla .html and .cgi files.
	</para>
      <note>
	<para>
	  Users of newer versions of Apache will generally find both
	  of the above lines will be in the httpd.conf file, rather
	  than srm.conf or access.conf.
	</para>
      </note>
	<warning>
	  <para>
	    There are important files and directories that should not
	  be a served by the HTTP server. These are most files in the
	  <quote>data</quote> and <quote>shadow</quote>  directories
	  and the <quote>localconfig</quote> file. You should
	  configure your HTTP server to not serve content from these
	  files. Failure to do so will expose critical passwords and
	  other data. Please see <xref linkend="htaccess"> for details
	  on how to do this for Apache.  I appreciate notes on how to
	  get this same functionality using other webservers.
	  </para>
	</warning>
      </section>

      <section>
	<title>Installing the Bugzilla Files</title>
	<para>
	  You should untar the Bugzilla files into a directory that
	you're willing to make writable by the default web server user
	(probably <quote>nobody</quote>).  You may decide to put the
	files off of the main web space for your web server or perhaps
	off of <filename>/usr/local</filename> with a symbolic link in
	the web space that points to the Bugzilla directory.  At any
	rate, just dump all the files in the same place, and make sure
	you can access the files in that directory through your web
	server.
	</para>
	<tip>
	  <para>
	    If you symlink the bugzilla directory into your Apache's
	  HTML heirarchy, you may receive
	  <errorname>Forbidden</errorname> errors unless you add the
	  <quote>FollowSymLinks</quote> directive to the
	  &lt;Directory&gt; entry for the HTML root.
	  </para>
	</tip>
	<para>
	  Once all the files are in a web accessible directory, make
	that directory writable by your webserver's user.  This is a
	temporary step until you run the post-install
	<filename>checksetup.pl</filename> script, which locks down your
	installation.
      </para>
      <para>
	Lastly, you'll need to set up a symbolic link to
	<filename>/usr/bonsaitools/bin/perl</filename> for the correct
	location of your perl executable (probably
	<filename>/usr/bin/perl</filename>). Otherwise you must hack
	all the .cgi files to change where they look for perl, or use
	<xref linkend="setperl">, found in
	<xref linkend="patches">.  I suggest using the symlink
	approach for future release compatability.

	      Here's how you set up the Perl symlink on Linux to make
	    Bugzilla work. Your mileage may vary.  For some UNIX
	    operating systems, you probably need to subsitute
	    <quote>/usr/local/bin/perl</quote> for
	    <quote>/usr/bin/perl</quote>  below; if on certain other
	    UNIX systems, Perl may live in weird places like
	    <quote>/opt/perl</quote>.  As root, run these commands:
	    <programlisting>
bash# mkdir /usr/bonsaitools  
bash# mkdir /usr/bonsaitools/bin 
bash# ln -s /usr/bin/perl /usr/bonsaitools/bin/perl
	    </programlisting>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Alternately, you can simply run this perl one-liner to
	    change your path to perl in all the files in your Bugzilla
	    installation:
	    <programlisting>
perl -pi -e 's@#!/usr/bonsaitools/bin/perl@#!/usr/bin/perl@' *cgi *pl Bug.pm
	    </programlisting>
	    Change the second path to perl to match your installation.
	  </para>
	</example>
	<tip>
	  <para>
	    If you don't have root access to set this symlink up,
	    check out the
	    <xref linkend="setperl">, listed in <xref
						      linkend="patches">. It will change the path to perl in all your Bugzilla files for you.
	  </para>

      <section>
	<title>Setting Up the MySQL Database</title>
	<para>
	  After you've gotten all the software installed and working you're ready
	  to start preparing the database for its life as a the back end to a high
	  quality bug tracker.
	</para>
	<para>
	  First, you'll want to fix MySQL permissions to allow access
	from Bugzilla.  For the purpose of this Installation section,
	the Bugzilla username will be <quote>bugs</quote>, and will
	have minimal permissions.
	
	<warning>
	  <para>
	    Bugzilla has not undergone a thorough security audit. It
	    may be possible for a system cracker to somehow trick
	    Bugzilla into executing a command such as <command>DROP
	      DATABASE mysql</command>.
	  </para>
	  <para>That would be bad.</para>
	</warning>
      </para>
      
      <para>
	Give the MySQL root user a password.  MySQL passwords are
	limited to 16 characters.
	<simplelist>
	  <member>
	    <computeroutput> <prompt>bash#</prompt> <command>mysql
		-u root mysql</command> </computeroutput>
	  </member>
	  <member>
	    <computeroutput> <prompt>mysql></prompt> <command>
		UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD ('new_password')
		WHERE user='root'; </command> </computeroutput>
	  </member>
	  <member>
	    <computeroutput> <prompt>mysql></prompt> <command>FLUSH
		PRIVILEGES;</command> </computeroutput>
	  </member>
	</simplelist> From this point on, if you need to access
	MySQL as the MySQL root user, you will need to use
	<command>mysql -u root -p</command> and enter your
	new_password.  Remember that MySQL user names have nothing to
	do with Unix user names (login names).	  
      </para>
      <para>
	Next, we create the <quote>bugs</quote> user, and grant
	sufficient permissions for checksetup.pl, which we'll use
	later, to work its magic.  This also restricts the
	<quote>bugs</quote> user to operations within a database
	called <quote>bugs</quote>, and only allows the account to
	connect from <quote>localhost</quote>.  Modify it to reflect
	your setup if you will be connecting from another machine or
	as a different user.
      </para>
      <para>
	Remember to set bugs_password to some unique password.
	<simplelist>
	  <member>
	    <computeroutput>
	      <prompt>mysql></prompt>
	      <command>GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,INDEX,
		ALTER,CREATE,DROP,REFERENCES 
		ON bugs.* TO bugs@localhost
		IDENTIFIED BY 'bugs_password';</command>
	    </computeroutput>
	  </member>
	  <member>
	    <computeroutput>
	      <prompt>
		mysql>
	      </prompt>
	      <command>
		FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
	      </command>
	    </computeroutput>
	  </member>
	</simplelist>
      </para>
      <para>
	Next, run the magic checksetup.pl script.  (Many thanks to
	Holger Schurig &lt;holgerschurig@nikocity.de&gt; for writing
	this script!) It will make sure Bugzilla files and directories
	have reasonable permissions, set up the
	<filename>data</filename> directory, and create all the MySQL
	tables.
	<simplelist>
	  <member>
	    <computeroutput> <prompt>bash#</prompt>
	      <command>./checksetup.pl</command> </computeroutput>
	  </member>
	</simplelist> The first time you run it, it will create a
	file called <filename>localconfig</filename>.
      </para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Tweaking <filename>localconfig</filename></title>
      <para>
	This file contains a variety of settings you may need to tweak including
	how Bugzilla should connect to the MySQL database.
      </para>
      <para>
	The connection settings include:
	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      server's host: just use <quote>localhost</quote> if the
	      MySQL server is local
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      database name: <quote>bugs</quote> if you're following
	      these directions
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      MySQL username: <quote>bugs</quote> if you're following
	      these directions
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Password for the <quote>bugs</quote> MySQL account above
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</orderedlist>
      </para>
      <para>
	You should also install .htaccess files that the Apache
	webserver will use  to restrict access to Bugzilla data files.
	See <xref
		  linkend="htaccess">.
      </para>
      <para>
	Once you are happy with the settings, re-run
	<filename>checksetup.pl</filename>. On this second run, it will
	  create the database and an administrator account for which
	  you will be prompted to provide information.
      </para>
      <para>
	When logged into an administrator account once Bugzilla is
	running, if you go to the query page (off of the Bugzilla main
	menu), you'll find an <quote>edit parameters</quote> option
	that is filled with editable treats.
      </para>
      <para>
	Should everything work, you will have a nearly empty Bugzilla
	database and a newly-created <filename>localconfig</filename>
	file in your Bugzilla root directory.
      </para>
      <para>
	<note>
	  <para>
	    The second time you run checksetup.pl, you should become
	    the user your web server runs as, and that you ensure that
	    you set the <quote>webservergroup</quote> parameter in localconfig to
	    match the web  server's group name, if any.  I believe,
	    for the next release of Bugzilla, this will be fixed so
	    that Bugzilla supports a <quote>webserveruser</quote> parameter in
	    localconfig as well.
	    <example>
	      <title>Running checksetup.pl as the web user</title>
	      <para>
		  Assuming your web server runs as user "apache", and
		Bugzilla is installed in "/usr/local/bugzilla", here's
		one way to run checksetup.pl as the web server user.
		As root, for the <emphasis>second run</emphasis> of
		checksetup.pl, do this: 
		<programlisting> 
bash# chown -R apache:apache /usr/local/bugzilla 
bash# su - apache 
bash# cd /usr/local/bugzilla 
bash# ./checksetup.pl 
		</programlisting>
	      </para>
	    </example>
	  </para>
	</note>
      </para>
      <note>
	<para>
	  The checksetup.pl script is designed so that you can run
	  it at any time without causing harm.  You should run it
	  after any upgrade to Bugzilla.
	</para>
      </note>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Setting Up Maintainers Manually (Optional)</title>
      <para>
	If you want to add someone else to every group by hand, you
	can do it by typing the appropriate MySQL commands.  Run
	<command> mysql -u root -p bugs</command> You
	may need different parameters, depending on your security
	settings. Then:
	  <simplelist>
	    <member>
	      <computeroutput> <prompt>mysql></prompt> <command>update
		profiles set groupset=0x7fffffffffffffff where
		login_name = 'XXX';</command> </computeroutput> (yes, that's <emphasis>fifteen</emphasis><quote>f</quote>'s.
	    </member>
	  </simplelist> replacing XXX with the Bugzilla email address.
	</para>
      </section>

      <section>
	<title>The Whining Cron (Optional)</title>
      <para>
	By now you have a fully functional bugzilla, but what good
	are bugs if they're not annoying?  To help make those bugs
	more annoying you can set up bugzilla's automatic whining
	system.  This can be done by adding the following command as a
	daily crontab entry (for help on that see that crontab man
	page):
	<simplelist>
	  <member>
	    <computeroutput> <command>cd
		&lt;your-bugzilla-directory&gt; ;
		./whineatnews.pl</command> </computeroutput>
	  </member>
	</simplelist>
      </para>
      <tip>
	<para>
	  Depending on your system, crontab may have several manpages.
	  The following command should  lead you to the most useful
	  page for this purpose: 
	  <programlisting>
 man 5 crontab
	  </programlisting>
	</para>
      </tip>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Bug Graphs (Optional)</title>
      <para>
	As long as you installed the GD and Graph::Base Perl modules
	you might as well turn on the nifty bugzilla bug reporting
	graphs.
      </para>
      <para>
	Add a cron entry like this to run collectstats daily at 5
	after midnight:
	<simplelist>
	  <member>
	    <computeroutput> <prompt>bash#</prompt> <command>crontab
		-e</command> </computeroutput>
	  </member>
	  <member>
	    <computeroutput> 5 0 * * * cd
	      &lt;your-bugzilla-directory&gt; ; ./collectstats.pl
	    </computeroutput>
	  </member>
	</simplelist>
      </para>
      <para>
	After two days have passed you'll be able to view bug graphs
	from the Bug Reports page. 
      </para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Securing MySQL</title>
      <para>
	If you followed the installation instructions for setting up
	your "bugs" and "root" user in MySQL, much of this should not
	apply to you.  If you are upgrading an existing installation
	of Bugzilla, you should pay close attention to this section.
      </para>
      <para>
	Most MySQL installs have "interesting" default security parameters:
	<simplelist>
	  <member>mysqld defaults to running as root</member>
	  <member>it defaults to allowing external network connections</member>
	  <member>it has a known port number, and is easy to detect</member>
	  <member>it defaults to no passwords whatsoever</member>
	  <member>it defaults to allowing "File_Priv"</member>
	</simplelist>
      </para>
      <para>
	This means anyone from anywhere on the internet can not only
	drop the database with one SQL command, and they can write as
	root to the system.
      </para>
      <para>
	To see your permissions do:
	<simplelist>
	  <member>

	  <member> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</member>

      </para>
      <para>
	With "mit-pthreads" you'll need to modify the "globals.pl" Mysql->Connect

    <title>Mac OS X Installation Notes</title>
    <para>
      There are a lot of common libraries and utilities out there
      that Apple did not include with Mac OS X, but which run
      perfectly well on it.  The GD library, which Bugzilla needs to
      do bug graphs, is one of these.
    </para>
    <para>
      The easiest way to get a lot of these is with a program called
      Fink, which is similar in nature to the CPAN installer, but
      installs common GNU utilities.  Fink is available from
      &lt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/fink/>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Follow the instructions for setting up Fink.  Once it's
      installed, you'll want to run the following as root:
      <command>fink install gd</command>
    </para>
    <para>
      It will prompt you for a number of dependencies, type 'y' and
      hit enter to install all of the dependencies.  Then watch it
      work.
    </para>
    <para>
      To prevent creating conflicts with the software that Apple
      installs by default, Fink creates its own directory tree at
      /sw where it installs most of the software that it installs.
      This means your libraries and headers for libgd will be at
      /sw/lib and /sw/include instead of /usr/lib and
      /usr/local/include.  Because of these changed locations for
      the libraries, the Perl GD module will not install directly
      via CPAN (it looks for the specific paths instead of getting
      them from your environment).  But there's a way around that
      :-)
    </para>
    <para>
      Instead of typing <quote>install GD</quote> at the
      <prompt>cpan&gt;</prompt> prompt, type <command>look
	GD</command>.  This should go through the motions of
      downloading the latest version of the GD module, then it will
      open a shell and drop you into the build directory. Apply the
      following patch to the Makefile.PL file (save the patch into a
      file  and use the command <command>patch &lt;
	patchfile</command>:

      <para>
	If you make a change to the structural data in your database
	(the versions table for example), or to the

	need to remove the cached content from the data directory
	(by doing a <quote>rm data/versioncache</quote>), or your
	changes won't show up.
      </para>
      <para>
	That file gets automatically regenerated whenever it's more than an

      <title>Upgrading From Previous Versions</title>
      <para>
	The developers of Bugzilla are constantly adding new tables, columns and

	to update is to simply always run the checksetup.pl script whenever
	you upgrade your installation of Bugzilla.  If you want to see what has
	changed, you can read the comments in that file, starting from the end.
      </para>

	      registry at the following location:
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      <programlisting>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC\Parameters\ScriptMap
	      </programlisting>
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The keys should be called ".pl" and ".cgi", and both
	      should have a value something like:
	      <command>c:/perl/bin/perl.exe "%s" "%s"</command>
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The KB article only talks about .pl, but it goes into
	      more detail and provides a perl test script.

	What follows is some late-breaking information on using the
	LDAP authentication options with Bugzilla.  The author has not
	tested these (nor even formatted this section!) so please
	contribute feedback to the newsgroup.

Mozilla::LDAP module

The Mozilla::LDAP module allows you to use LDAP for authentication to
the Bugzilla system.  This module is not required if you are not using
LDAP.

Mozilla::LDAP (aka PerLDAP) is available for download from
http://www.mozilla.org/directory.

NOTE: The Mozilla::LDAP module requires Netscape's Directory SDK.
Follow the link for "Directory SDK for C" on that same page to
download the SDK first.  After you have installed this SDK, then
install the PerLDAP module.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-Installation Checklist
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Set useLDAP to "On" **only** if you will be using an LDAP directory
for authentication.  Be very careful when setting up this parameter;
if you set LDAP authentication, but do not have a valid LDAP directory
set up, you will not be able to log back in to Bugzilla once you log
out.  (If this happens, you can get back in by manually editing the
data/params file, and setting useLDAP back to 0.)

If using LDAP, you must set the three additional parameters:

Set LDAPserver to the name (and optionally port) of your LDAP server.
If no port is specified, it defaults to the default port of 389.  (e.g
"ldap.mycompany.com" or "ldap.mycompany.com:1234")

Set LDAPBaseDN to the base DN for searching for users in your LDAP
directory.  (e.g. "ou=People,o=MyCompany")  uids must be unique under
the DN specified here.

Set LDAPmailattribute to the name of the attribute in your LDAP
directory which contains the primary email address.  On most directory
servers available, this is "mail", but you may need to change this.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

(Not sure where this bit should go, but it's important that it be in
there somewhere...)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Using LDAP authentication for Bugzilla:

The existing authentication scheme for Bugzilla uses email addresses
as the primary user ID, and a password to authenticate that user.  All
places within Bugzilla where you need to deal with user ID (e.g
assigning a bug) use the email address.

The LDAP authentication builds on top of this scheme, rather than
replacing it.  The initial log in is done with a username and password
for the LDAP directory.  This then fetches the email address from LDAP
and authenticates seamlessly in the standard Bugzilla authentication
scheme using this email address.  If an account for this address
already exists in your Bugzilla system, it will log in to that
account.  If no account for that email address exists, one is created
at the time of login.  (In this case, Bugzilla will attempt to use the
"displayName" or "cn" attribute to determine the user's full name.)

After authentication, all other user-related tasks are still handled
by email address, not LDAP username.  You still assign bugs by email
address, query on users by email address, etc.
