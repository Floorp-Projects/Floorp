	  If you are installing Bugzilla on S.u.S.e. Linux, or some other
	  distributions with "paranoid" security options, it is possible
	  that the checksetup.pl script may fail with the error:
	  <ERRORNAME>cannot chdir(/var/spool/mqueue): Permission denied</ERRORNAME>
	  This is because your
	  /var/spool/mqueue directory has a mode of "drwx------".  Type
	  <COMMAND>chmod 755 /var/spool/mqueue</COMMAND> as root to fix this problem.

	  Bugzilla is not a package where you can just plop it in a directory,
	  twiddle a few things, and you're off.  Installing Bugzilla assumes you
	  know your variant of UNIX or Microsoft Windows well, are familiar with the
	  command line, and are comfortable compiling and installing a plethora
	  of third-party utilities.  To install Bugzilla on Win32 requires
	  fair Perl proficiency, and if you use a webserver other than Apache you
	  should be intimately familiar with the security mechanisms and CGI
	  environment thereof.

	<PARA>
	  Installation of bugzilla is pretty straightforward, particularly if your
	  machine already has MySQL and the MySQL-related perl packages installed.
	  If those aren't installed yet, then that's the first order of business.  The
	  other necessary ingredient is a web server set up to run cgi scripts.
	  While using Apache for your webserver is not required, it is recommended.

	  Bugzilla has been successfully installed under Solaris, Linux, and

	      Your machine may be vulnerable to attacks
	      while you are installing. In other words, ensure there is some kind of firewall between you
	      and the rest of the Internet.  Many installation steps require an active Internet connection
	      to complete, but you must take care to ensure that at no point is your machine vulnerable
	      to an attack.

	<TITLE>Installing MySQL Database</TITLE>
	<PARA>
	  Visit MySQL homepage at http://www.mysql.org/ and grab the latest stable
	  release of the server.  Both binaries and source are available and which
	  you get shouldn't matter.  Be aware that many of the binary versions
	  of MySQL store their data files in /var which on many installations
	  (particularly common with linux installations) is part of a smaller
	  root partition.  If you decide to build from sources you can easily set
	  the dataDir as an option to configure.
	</PARA>
	<PARA>
	  If you've installed from source or non-package (RPM, deb, etc.) binaries
	  you'll want to make sure to add mysqld to your init scripts so the server
	  daemon will come back up whenever your machine reboots.
	  You also may want to edit those init scripts, to make sure that
	  mysqld will accept large packets.  By default, mysqld is set up to only
	  accept packets up to 64K long.  This limits the size of attachments you
	  may put on bugs.  If you add something like "-O max_allowed_packet=1M"
	  to the command that starts mysqld (or safe_mysqld), then you will be
	  able to have attachments up to about 1 megabyte.
	</PARA>
	<NOTE>
	  <PARA>
	    If you plan on running Bugzilla and MySQL on the same machine,
	    consider using the "--skip-networking" option in the init script.
	    This enhances security by preventing network access to MySQL.

	  Any machine that doesn't have perl on it is a sad machine indeed.  Perl
	  for *nix systems can be gotten in source form from http://www.perl.com.
	</PARA>
	<PARA>
	  Perl is now a far cry from the the single compiler/interpreter binary it
	  once was.  It now includes a great many required modules and quite a
	  few other support files.  If you're not up to or not inclined to build
	  perl from source, you'll want to install it on your machine using some
	  sort of packaging system (be it RPM, deb, or what have you) to ensure
	  a sane install.  In the subsequent sections you'll be installing quite
	  a few perl modules; this can be quite ornery if your perl installation
	  isn't up to snuff.

	<TIP>
	  <PARA>
	    You can skip the following Perl module installation
	    steps by installing "Bundle::Bugzilla" from CPAN, which includes them.
	    All Perl module installation steps require you have an active Internet

	    Bundle::Bugzilla doesn't include GD, Chart::Base, or MIME::Parser,
	    which are not essential to a basic Bugzilla install.  If installing

	<TITLE>DBI Perl Module</TITLE>
	<PARA>
	  The DBI module is a generic Perl module used by other database related
	  Perl modules.  For our purposes it's required by the MySQL-related
	  modules.  As long as your Perl installation was done correctly the
	  DBI module should be a breeze.  It's a mixed Perl/C module, but Perl's
	  MakeMaker system simplifies the C compilation greatly.
	</PARA>
	<PARA>
	  Like almost all Perl modules DBI can be found on the Comprehensive Perl
	  Archive Network (CPAN) at http://www.cpan.org.  The CPAN servers have a
	  real tendency to bog down, so please use mirrors.  The current location
	  at the time of this writing (02/17/99) can be found in Appendix A.
	</PARA>
	<PARA>
	  Quality, general Perl module installation instructions can be found on
	  the CPAN website, but the easy thing to do is to just use the CPAN shell
	  which does all the hard work for you.

	<TITLE>Data::Dumper Perl Module</TITLE>
	<PARA>
	  The Data::Dumper module provides data structure persistence for Perl
	  (similar to Java's serialization).  It comes with later sub-releases of
	  Perl 5.004, but a re-installation just to be sure it's available won't
	  hurt anything.
	</PARA>
	<PARA>
	  Data::Dumper is used by the MySQL related Perl modules.  It can be
	  found on CPAN (link in Appendix A) and can be installed by following
	  the same four step make sequence used for the DBI module.
	</PARA>
      </SECTION>

      <SECTION>
	<TITLE>MySQL related Perl Module Collection</TITLE>
	<PARA>
	  The Perl/MySQL interface requires a few mutually-dependent perl
	  modules.  These modules are grouped together into the the
	  Msql-Mysql-modules package.  This package can be found at CPAN.
	  After the archive file has been downloaded it should
	  be untarred.
	</PARA>
	<PARA>
	  The MySQL modules are all built using one make file which is generated
	  by running:
	  <PROMPT>bash#</PROMPT>
	  <COMMAND>perl Makefile.pl</COMMAND>
	</PARA>
	<PARA>
	  The MakeMaker process will ask you a few questions about the desired
	  compilation target and your MySQL installation.  For many of the questions
	  the provided default will be adequate.
	</PARA>
	<PARA>
	  When asked if your desired target is the MySQL or mSQL packages
	  selected the MySQL related ones.  Later you will be asked if you wish
	  to provide backwards compatibility with the older MySQL packages; you
	  must answer YES to this question.  The default will be no, and if you
	  select it things won't work later.
	</PARA>
	<PARA>
	  A host of 'localhost' should be fine and a testing user of 'test' and
	  a null password should find itself with sufficient access to run tests
	  on the 'test' database which MySQL created upon installation.  If 'make
	  test' and 'make install' go through without errors you should be ready
	  to go as far as database connectivity is concerned.
	</PARA>
      </SECTION>

      <SECTION>
	<TITLE>TimeDate Perl Module Collection</TITLE>
	<PARA>
	  Many of the more common date/time/calendar related Perl modules have
	  been grouped into a bundle similar to the MySQL modules bundle. This
	  bundle is stored on the CPAN under the name TimeDate.  A (hopefully
	  current) link can be found in Appendix A.  The component module we're
	  most interested in is the Date::Format module, but installing all of them
	  is probably a good idea anyway.  The standard Perl module installation
	  instructions should work perfectly for this simple package.
	</PARA>
      </SECTION>
      <SECTION>
	<TITLE>GD Perl Module (1.8.3)</TITLE>
	<PARA>
	  The GD library was written by Thomas Boutell a long while ago to
	  programatically generate images in C.  Since then it's become almost a
	  defacto standard for programatic image construction.  The Perl bindings
	  to it found in the GD library are used on a million web pages to generate
	  graphs on the fly.  That's what bugzilla will be using it for so you'd
	  better install it if you want any of the graphing to work.
	</PARA>
	<PARA>
	  Actually bugzilla uses the Graph module which relies on GD itself,
	  but isn't that always the way with OOP.  At any rate, you can find the
	  GD library on CPAN (link in Appendix "Required Software").  
	</PARA>
	<NOTE>
	  <PARA>
	    The Perl GD library requires some other libraries that may or may not be
	    installed on your system, including "libpng" and "libgd".  The full requirements
	    are listed in the Perl GD library README.  Just realize that if compiling GD fails,
	    it's probably because you're missing a required library.
	  </PARA>
	</NOTE>
      </SECTION>

      <SECTION>
	<TITLE>Chart::Base Perl Module (0.99c)</TITLE>
	<PARA>
	  The Chart module provides bugzilla with on-the-fly charting
	  abilities.  It can be installed in the usual fashion after it has been
	  fetched from CPAN where it is found as the Chart-x.x... tarball in a
	  directory to be listed in Appendix "Required Software".  Note that as with the GD perl
	  module, only the specific versions listed above (or newer) will work. Earlier
	  versions used GIF's, which are no longer supported by the latest
	  versions of GD.
	</PARA>

      <SECTION>
	<TITLE>DB_File Perl Module</TITLE>
	<PARA>
	  DB_File is a module which allows Perl programs to make use of the facilities provided by 
	  Berkeley DB version 1.x. This module is required by collectstats.pl which is used for 
	  bug charting. If you plan to make use of bug charting, you must install this module.

      <SECTION>
	<TITLE>HTTP Server</TITLE>
	<PARA>
	  You have a freedom of choice here - Apache, Netscape or any other
	  server on UNIX would do.  You can easily run the web server on a different
	  machine than MySQL, but need to adjust the MySQL "bugs" user permissions
	  accordingly.
	</PARA>
	<PARA>
	  You'll want to make sure that your web server will run any file
	  with the .cgi extension as a cgi and not just display it.  If you're using
	  apache that means uncommenting the following line in the srm.conf file:
	  <COMPUTEROUTPUT>AddHandler cgi-script .cgi</COMPUTEROUTPUT>
	</PARA>
	<PARA>
	  With apache you'll also want to make sure that within the access.conf
	  file the line:
	  <COMPUTEROUTPUT>
	    Options ExecCGI
	  </COMPUTEROUTPUT>
	  is in the stanza that covers the directories you intend to put the bugzilla
	  .html and .cgi files into.
	</PARA>
	<PARA>
	  If you are using a newer version of Apache, both of the above lines will be
	  (or will need to be) in the httpd.conf file, rather than srm.conf or
	  access.conf.
	</PARA>
	<WARNING>
	  <PARA>
	    There are two critical directories and a file that should not be a served by
	    the HTTP server. These are the 'data' and 'shadow' directories and the
	    'localconfig' file. You should configure your HTTP server to not serve
	    content from these files. Failure to do so will expose critical passwords
	    and other data. Please see your HTTP server configuration manual on how
	    to do this. If you use quips (at the top of the buglist pages) you will want
	    the 'data/comments' file to still be served. This file contains those quips.

      <SECTION>
	<TITLE>Installing the Bugzilla Files</TITLE>
	<PARA>
	  You should untar the Bugzilla files into a directory that you're
	  willing to make writable by the default web server user (probably
	  'nobody').  You may decide to put the files off of the main web space
	  for your web server or perhaps off of /usr/local with a symbolic link
	  in the web space that points to the bugzilla directory.  At any rate,
	  just dump all the files in the same place (optionally omitting the CVS
	  directories if they were accidentally tarred up with the rest of Bugzilla)
	  and make sure you can access the files in that directory through your
	  web server.
	</PARA>
	<TIP>
	  <PARA>
	    HINT:  If you symlink the bugzilla directory into your Apache's
	    HTML heirarchy, you may receive "Forbidden" errors unless you
	    add the "FollowSymLinks" directive to the &lt;Directory&gt; entry
	    for the HTML root.
	  </PARA>
	</TIP>
	<PARA>
	  Once all the files are in a web accessible directory, make that
	  directory writable by your webserver's user (which may require just
	  making it world writable).  This is a temporary step until you run
	  the post-install "checksetup.pl" script, which locks down your
	  installation.
	</PARA>
	<PARA>
	  Lastly, you'll need to set up a symbolic link from /usr/bonsaitools/bin
	  to the correct location of your perl executable (probably /usr/bin/perl).
	  Otherwise you must hack all the .cgi files to change where they look
	  for perl.  To make future upgrades easier, you should use the symlink
	  approach.
	  <TIP>
	    <PARA>
	      If you don't have root access to set this symlink up, check out the
	      "setperl.csh" utility, listed in the Patches section of this
	      Guide.  It will change the path to perl in all your Bugzilla files for
	      you.

	  First, you'll want to fix MySQL permissions to allow access from

	  Next, we create the "bugs" user, and grant sufficient

	<PARA>
	  This file contains a variety of settings you may need to tweak including
	  how Bugzilla should connect to the MySQL database.
	</PARA>
	<PARA>
	  The connection settings include:
	  <ORDEREDLIST>
	    <LISTITEM>
	      <PARA>
		server's host: just use "localhost" if the MySQL server is
                local
	      </PARA>
	    </LISTITEM>
	    <LISTITEM>
	      <PARA>
		database name: "bugs" if you're following these directions

		MySQL username: "bugs" if you're following these directions

	      <PARA>
		Password for the "bugs" MySQL account above
	      </PARA>
	    </LISTITEM>
	  </ORDEREDLIST>
	</PARA>
	<PARA>
	  Once you are happy with the settings, re-run checksetup.pl.  On this
	  second run, it will create the database and an administrator account
	  for which you will be prompted to provide information.
	</PARA>
	<PARA>
	  When logged into an administrator account once Bugzilla is running,
	  if you go to the query page (off of the bugzilla main menu), you'll
	  find an 'edit parameters' option that is filled with editable treats.
	</PARA>
	<PARA>
	  Should everything work, you should have a nearly empty copy of the bug
	  tracking setup.
	</PARA>
	<PARA>
	  The second time around, checksetup.pl will stall if it is on a
	  filesystem that does not fully support file locking via flock(), such as
	  NFS mounts.  This support is required for Bugzilla to operate safely with
	  multiple instances. If flock() is not fully supported, it will stall at:
	  <ERRORCODE>Now regenerating the shadow database for all bugs.</ERRORCODE>
	  <NOTE>
	    <PARA>
	      The second time you run checksetup.pl, it is recommended you be the same
	      user as your web server runs under, and that you be sure you have set the
	      "webservergroup" parameter in localconfig to match the web server's group
	      name, if any.  Under some systems, otherwise, checksetup.pl will goof up
	      your file permissions and make them unreadable to your web server.
	    </PARA>
	  </NOTE>
	</PARA>
	<NOTE>
	  <PARA>
	    The checksetup.pl script is designed so that you can run it at any time
	    without causing harm.  You should run it after any upgrade to Bugzilla.

	    Bugzilla optimizes database lookups by storing all relatively static
	    information in the versioncache file, located in the data/ subdirectory
	    under your installation directory (we said before it needs to be writable,
	    right?!)
	  </PARA>
	  <PARA>
	    If you make a change to the structural data in your database (the
	    versions table for example), or to the "constants" encoded in
	    defparams.pl, you will need to remove the cached content from the data
	    directory (by doing a "rm data/versioncache"), or your changes won't show
	    up!
	  </PARA>
	  <PARA>
	    That file gets automatically regenerated whenever it's more than an

	    The developers of Bugzilla are constantly adding new tables, columns and

	    you upgrade your installation of Bugzilla.  If you want to see what has
	    changed, you can read the comments in that file, starting from the end.

	<PARA>"Brian" had this to add, about upgrading to Bugzilla 2.12 from previous versions:</PARA>

	  <PARA>
	    Hi - I am updating bugzilla to 2.12 so I can tell you what I did (after I
	    deleted the current dir and copied the files in).
	  </PARA>
	  <PARA>
	    In checksetup.pl, I did the following...
	  </PARA>
	  <PROCEDURE>
	    <STEP>
	      <PROGRAMLISTING>
my $webservergid = getgrnam($my_webservergroup);
	      </PROGRAMLISTING>
	      <PARA>to</PARA>
	      <PROGRAMLISTING>
my $webservergid = 'Administrators'		
	      </PROGRAMLISTING>
	    </STEP>
	    <STEP>
	      <PARA>
		I then ran checksetup.pl
	      </PARA>
	    </STEP>
	    <STEP>
	      <PARA>
		I removed all the encrypt()
		<EXAMPLE>
		  <TITLE>Removing encrypt() for Windows NT installations</TITLE>
		  <PARA>
		    Replace this:
		    <PROGRAMLISTING>
SendSQL("SELECT encrypt(" . SqlQuote($enteredpwd) . ", " .
    SqlQuote(substr($realcryptpwd, 0, 2)) . ")");
my $enteredcryptpwd = FetchOneColumn();
		    </PROGRAMLISTING>
		    with this:
		    <PROGRAMLISTING>
my $enteredcryptpwd = $enteredpwd
		    </PROGRAMLISTING>
		    in cgi.pl.
		  </PARA>
		</EXAMPLE>
	      </PARA>
	    </STEP>
	    <STEP>
	      <PARA>
		I renamed processmail to processmail.pl
	      </PARA>
	    </STEP>
	    <STEP>
	      <PARA>
		I altered the sendmail statements to windmail:
		<PROGRAMLISTING>  
open SENDMAIL, "|\"C:/General/Web/tools/Windmail 4.0 Beta/windmail\" -t > mail.log";
		</PROGRAMLISTING>
	      </PARA>
	      <PARA>
		The quotes around the dir is for the spaces. mail.log is for the output
	      </PARA>
