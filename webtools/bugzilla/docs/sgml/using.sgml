    <title>What is Bugzilla?</title>
    <para>
      Bugzilla is one example of a class of programs called "Defect Tracking Systems",
      or, more commonly, "Bug-Tracking Systems".  Defect Tracking Systems allow individual or
      groups of developers to keep track of outstanding bugs in their product effectively.
      Bugzilla was originally written by Terry Weissman in a programming language called
      "TCL", to replace a crappy
      bug-tracking database used internally for Netscape Communications.  Terry later ported
      Bugzilla to
      Perl from TCL, and in Perl it remains to this day.
      Most commercial defect-tracking software vendors at the
      time charged enormous licensing fees, and Bugzilla quickly became a favorite of the
      open-source crowd (with its genesis in the open-source browser project, Mozilla).  It
      is now the de-facto standard defect-tracking system against which all others are
      measured.
    </para>
    <para>
      Bugzilla has matured immensely, and now boasts many advanced features.  These include:

	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      Despite its current robustness and popularity, however, Bugzilla
      faces some near-term challenges, such as reliance on a single database, a lack of
      abstraction of the user interface and program logic, verbose email bug
      notifications, a powerful but daunting query interface, little reporting configurability,
      problems with extremely large queries, some unsupportable bug resolution options,
      no internationalization, and dependence on some nonstandard libraries.
    </para>
    <para>
      Some recent headway has been made on the query front, however.  If you are using the latest
      version of Bugzilla, you should see a "simple search" form on the default front page of
      your Bugzilla install.  Type in two or three search terms and you should pull up some
      relevant information.  This is also available as "queryhelp.cgi".
    </para>
    <para>
      Despite these small problems, Bugzilla is very hard to beat.  It is under <emphasis>very</emphasis>
      active development to address the current issues, and a long-awaited overhaul in the form
      of Bugzilla 3.0 is expected sometime later this year.
    </para>

  <section id="why">
    <title>Why Should We Use Bugzilla?</title>
    <epigraph>
      <para>
	No, Who's on first...
      </para>
    </epigraph>
    <para>
      For many years, defect-tracking software has remained principally the domain
      of large software development houses.  Even then, most shops never bothered
      with bug-tracking software, and instead simply relied on shared lists and
      email to monitor the status of defects.  This procedure is error-prone and
      tends to cause those bugs judged least significant by developers to be
      dropped or ignored
    </para>
    <para>
      These days, many companies are finding that integrated defect-tracking
      systems reduce downtime, increase productivity, and raise customer 
      satisfaction with their systems.  Along with full disclosure, an open
      bug-tracker allows manufacturers to keep in touch with their clients
      and resellers, to communicate about problems effectively throughout
      the data management chain.  Many corporations have also discovered that
      defect-tracking helps reduce costs by providing IT support accountability,
      telephone support knowledge bases, and a common, well-understood system
      for accounting for unusual system or software issues.
    </para>
    <para>
      But why should <emphasis>you</emphasis> use Bugzilla?
    </para>
    <para>
      Bugzilla is very adaptable to various situations.  Known uses currently
      include IT support queues, Systems Administration deployment management,
      chip design and development problem tracking (both pre-and-post fabrication),
      and software and hardware bug tracking for luminaries such as Redhat, Loki software,
      Linux-Mandrake, and VA Systems.  Combined with systems such as CVS, Bonsai,
      or Perforce SCM, Bugzilla provides a powerful, easy-to-use  solution to
      configuration management and replication problems
    </para>
    <para>
      Bugzilla can dramatically increase the productivity and accountability
      of individual employees by providing a documented workflow and positive
      feedback for good performance.  How many times do you wake up in the
      morning, remembering that you were supposed to do *something* today,
      but you just can't quite remember?  Put it in Bugzilla, and you have a record
      of it from which you can extrapolate milestones, predict product versions
      for integration, and by using Bugzilla's e-mail integration features
      be able to follow the discussion trail that led to critical decisions.
    </para>
    <para>
      Ultimately, Bugzilla puts the power in your hands to improve your value
      to your employer or business while providing a usable framework for your natural
      attention to detail and knowledge store to flourish.

      Bugzilla is a large, complex system.  Describing how to use it
      requires some time.  If you are only interested in installing or administering
      a Bugzilla installation, please consult the Installing and Administering
      Bugzilla portions of this Guide.  This section is principally aimed towards
      developing end-user mastery of Bugzilla, so you may fully enjoy the benefits
      afforded by using this reliable open-source bug-tracking software.

      Although Landfill serves as a great introduction to Bugzilla, it does not offer
      all the options you would have as a user on your own installation of Bugzilla,
      nor can it do more than serve as a general introduction to Bugzilla.  Additionally,
      Landfill often runs cutting-edge versions of Bugzilla for testing, so some things
      may work slightly differently than mentioned here.

	Congratulations!  If you followed these directions, you now are the
	proud owner of a user account on landfill.tequilarista.org (Landfill) or
	your local Bugzilla install.  You should now see in your browser a
	page called the "Bugzilla Query Page".  It may look daunting, but
	with this Guide to walk you through it, you will master it in no time.
      </para>
    </section>
    
    <section id="query">
      <title>The Bugzilla Query Page</title>
      <para>
	The Bugzilla Query Page is the heart and soul of Bugzilla.  It is the master
	interface where you can find any bug report, comment, or patch currently in the Bugzilla
	system.  We'll go into how to create your own bug report later on.
      </para>
      <para>
	There are efforts underway to simplify query usage.  If you have a local installation
	of Bugzilla 2.12 or higher, you should have "quicksearch.html" available
	to use and simplify your searches.  There is also, or shortly will be, a helper
	for the query interface, called "queryhelp.cgi".  Landfill tends to run the latest code,
	so these two utilities should be available there for your perusal.
      </para>
      <para>
	At this point, please visit the main Bugzilla site,
	<ulink url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/query.cgi">
	bugzilla.mozilla.org</ulink>, to see a more fleshed-out query page.
      </para>
      <para>
	The first thing you need to notice about the Bugzilla Query Page is that
	nearly every box you see on your screen has a hyperlink nearby, explaining what
	it is or what it does.  Near the upper-left-hand corner of your browser window
	you should see the word "Status" underlined.  Select it.
      </para>
      <para>
	Notice the page that popped up?  Every underlined word you see on your screen
	is a hyperlink that will take you to context-sensitive help.
	Click around for a while, and learn what everything here does.  To return
	to the query interface after pulling up a help page, use the "Back" button in
	your browser.
      </para>
      <para>
	I'm sure that after checking out the online help, you are now an Expert
	on the Bugzilla Query Page.  If, however, you feel you haven't mastered it yet,
	let me walk you through making a few successful queries to find out what there
	are in the Bugzilla bug-tracking system itself.
      </para>
      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Ensure you are back on the "Bugzilla Query Page"
	    Do nothing in the boxes marked "Status", "Resolution", "Platform", "OpSys",
	    "Priority", or "Severity".  The default query for "Status" is to find all bugs that
	    are NEW, ASSIGNED, or REOPENED, which is what we want.  If you don't select anything
	    in the other 5 scrollboxes there, then you are saying that "any of these are OK";
	    we're not locking ourselves into only finding bugs on the "DEC" Platform, or "Windows 95"
	    OpSys (Operating System).  You're smart, I think you have it figured out.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Basically, selecting <emphasis>anything</emphasis> on the query page narrows your search
	    down.  Leaving stuff unselected, or text boxes unfilled, broadens your search!
	  </para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    You see the box immediately below the top six boxes that contains an "Email" text box, 
	    with the words "matching as", a drop-down selection box, then some checkboxes with
	    "Assigned To" checked by default?  This allows you to filter your search down based upon
	    email address.  Let's put my email address in there, and see what happens.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Type "barnboy@trilobyte.net" in the top Email text box.
	  </para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Let's narrow the search some more.  Scroll down until you find the box with the word
	    "Program" over the top of it.  This is where we can narrow our search down to only
	    specific products (software programs or product lines) in our Bugzilla database.
	    Please notice the box is a <emphasis>scrollbox</emphasis>.  Using the down arrow on the
	    scrollbox, scroll down until you can see an entry called "Webtools".  Select this entry.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Did you notice that some of the boxes to the right changed when you selected "Webtools"?
	    Every Program (or Product) has different Versions, Components, and Target Milestones associated
	    with it.  A "Version" is the number of a software program.
	    <example>
	      <title>Some Famous Software Versions</title>
	      <informalexample>
		<para>
		  Do you remember the hype in 1995 when Microsoft Windows 95(r) was released?
		  It may have been several years
		  ago, but Microsoft(tm) spent over $300 Million advertising this new Version of their
		  software.  Three years later, they released Microsoft Windows 98(r),
		  another new version, to great fanfare, and then in 2000 quietly 
		  released Microsoft Windows ME(Millenium Edition)(r). 
		</para>
		<para>
		  Software "Versions" help a manufacturer differentiate
		  their current product from their
		  previous products.  Most do not identify their products
		  by the year they were released.
		  Instead, the "original" version of their software will
		  often be numbered "1.0", with
		  small bug-fix releases on subsequent tenths of a digit.  In most cases, it's not
		  a decimal number; for instance, often 1.9 is an <emphasis>older</emphasis> version
		  of the software than 1.11,
		  but is a <emphasis>newer</emphasis> version than 1.1.1.
		</para>
		<para>
		  In general, a "Version" in Bugzilla should refer to 
		  <emphasis>released</emphasis>
		  products, not products that have not yet been released 
		  to the public.  Forthcoming products
		  are what the Target Milestone field is for.
		</para>
	      </informalexample>
	    </example>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    A "Component" is a piece of a Product.
	    It may be a standalone program, or some other logical
	    division of a Product or Program. 
	    Normally, a Component has a single Owner, who is responsible
	    for overseeing efforts to improve that Component.
	    <example>
	      <title>Mozilla Webtools Components</title>
	      <informalexample>
		<para>
		  Mozilla's "Webtools" Product is composed of several pieces (Components):

	  </para>
	  <para>
	    A "Milestone", or "Target Milestone" is a often a planned future "Version" of a
	    product.  In many cases, though, Milestones simply represent significant dates for
	    a developer.  Having certain features in your Product is frequently
	    tied to revenue (money)
	    the developer will receive if the features work by the time she 
	    reaches the Target Milestone.
	    Target Milestones are a great tool to organize your time.
	    If someone will pay you $100,000 for
	    incorporating certain features by a certain date,
	    those features by that Milestone date become
	    a very high priority.  Milestones tend to be highly malleable creatures,
	    though, that appear
	    to be in reach but are out of reach by the time the important day arrives.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The Bugzilla Project has set up Milestones for future 
	    Bugzilla versions 2.14, 2.16, 2.18, 3.0, etc.  However,
	    a Target Milestone can just as easily be a specific date,
	    code name, or weird alphanumeric
	    combination, like "M19".

	    Congratulations!  You've completed your first Query, and have before you the Bug List
	    of the author of this Guide, Matthew P. Barnson (barnboy@trilobyte.net).  If I'm
	    doing well,
	    you'll have a cryptic "Zarro Boogs Found" message on your screen.  It is just
	    a happy hacker's way of saying "Zero Bugs Found".  However, I am fairly certain I will
	    always have some bugs assigned to me that aren't done yet,
	    so you won't often see that message!
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <para>
	I encourage you to click the bug numbers in the left-hand column and examine
	my bugs.  Also notice that if you click the underlined 
	links near the top of this page, they do
	not take you to context-sensitive help here,
	but instead sort the columns of bugs on the screen!
	When you need to sort your bugs by priority, severity,
	or the people they are assigned to, this
	is a tremendous timesaver.
      </para>
      <para>
	A couple more interesting things about the Bug List page:
	<simplelist>
	  <member><emphasis>Change Columns</emphasis>:
	    by selecting this link, you can show all kinds
	    of information in the Bug List</member>
	  <member><emphasis>Change several bugs at once</emphasis>:
	    If you have sufficient rights to change all
	    the bugs shown in the Bug List, you can mass-modify them.
	    This is a big time-saver.</member>
	  <member><emphasis>Send mail to bug owners</emphasis>:
	    If you have many related bugs, you can request
	    an update from every person who owns the bugs in
	    the Bug List asking them the status.</member>
	  <member><emphasis>Edit this query</emphasis>:
	    If you didn't get exactly the results you were looking for,
	    you can return to the Query page through this link and make
	    small revisions to the query you just made so
	    you get more accurate results.</member>
	</simplelist>
      </para>
      <note>
	<para>
	  There are many more options to the Bugzilla Query Page 
	  and the Bug List than I have shown you.
	  But this should be enough for you to learn to get around.
	  I encourage you to check out the

	  You have now learned the basics of Bugzilla navigation,
	  entering a bug, and bug maintenance.
	  I encourage you to explore these features, and see what you can do with them!
	  We'll spend no more time on individual Bugs or Queries from this point on, so you are
	  on your own there.
	</para>
	<para>
	  But I'll give a few last hints!
	</para>
	<para>
	  There is a <ulink url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/help.html">CLUE</ulink>
	  on the Query page
	  that will teach you more how to use the form.
	</para>
	<para>
	  If you click the hyperlink on the
	  <ulink url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi">Component</ulink>
	  box of the Query page, you will be presented a form that will describe what all
	  the components are.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Possibly the most powerful feature of the Query page is the 
	  <ulink url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/booleanchart.html">Boolean Chart</ulink> section.
	  It's a bit confusing to use the first time, but can provide unparalleled
	  flexibility in your queries,
	  allowing you to build extremely powerful requests.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Finally, you can build some nifty 
	  <ulink url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/reports.cgi">Reports</ulink>
	  using the "Bug Reports" link near the bottom of the query page, and also
	  available via the "Reports" link
	  at the footer of each page.
	</para>

      Customized User Preferences offer tremendous versatility to
      your individual Bugzilla experience.
      Let's plunge into what you can do!  The first step is to click
      the "Edit prefs" link at the footer of each page once you
      have logged in to
      <ulink url="http://landfill.tequilarista.org/mozilla/bugzilla/query.cgi?GoAheadAndLogIn=1">

    <section id="accountsettings">
      <title>Account Settings</title>
      <para>
	On this page, you can change your basic Account Settings,
	including your password and full name.
	For security reasons, in order to change anything on this page you
	must type your <emphasis>current</emphasis>
	password into the "Old Password" field. 
	If you wish to change your password, type the new password you
	want into the "New Password" field and again into the "Re-enter 
	new password" field to ensure
	you typed your new password correctly.  Select the "Submit" button and you're done!
      </para>

      <section id="notification">
	<title>Email Notification</title>
	<note>
	  <para>
	    The email notification settings described below have been obsoleted in Bugzilla 2.12, and
	    this section will be replaced with a comprehensive description of the amazing array of 
	    new options at your disposal.  However, in the meantime, throw this chunk out the window
	    and go crazy with goofing around with different notification options.
	  </para>
	</note>
	<para>
	  Ahh, here you can reduce or increase the amount of email sent you from Bugzilla!
	  In the drop-down "Notify me of changes to", select one of
	  <simplelist>
	    <member><emphasis>All qualifying bugs</emphasis>: sends you every change to every bug
	      where your name is somewhere on it, regardless of who changed it.</member>
	    <member><emphasis>Only those bugs which I am listed in the CC line</emphasis>: prevents
	      you from receiving mail for which you are the reporter,'
	      owner, or QA contact.  If you are on the CC
	      list, presumably someone had a <emphasis>good</emphasis>
	      reason for you to get the email.</member>
	    <member><emphasis>All qulifying bugs except those which I change</emphasis>:
	      This is the default, and
	      a sensible setting.  If someone else changes your bugs, you will get emailed,
	      but if you change bugs
	      yourself you will receive no notification of the change.</member>
	  </simplelist>
	</para>
      </section>
      <section id="newemailtech">
	<title>New Email Technology</title>
	<note>
	  <para>
	    This option may not be available in all Bugzilla installations, depending upon
	    the preferences of the systems administrator responsible for the setup of your Bugzilla.
	    However, if you really want this functionality, ask her to "enable newemailtech
	    in Params"
	    and "make it the default for all new users", referring her to the Administration section
	    of this Guide.
	  </para>
	</note>
	<para>
	  Disregard the warnings about "experimental and bleeding edge"; the code to handle email
	  in a cleaner manner than that historically used for Bugzilla is
	  quite robust and well-tested now.
	</para>
	<para>
	  I recommend you enable the option, "Click here to sign up (and risk any bugs)".
	  Your email-box
	  will thank you for it.  The fundamental shift in "newemailtech" is away from standard UNIX
	  "diff" output, which is quite ugly, to a prettier, better laid-out email.
	</para>
      </section>
      <section id="watchsettings">
	<title>"Watching" Users</title>
	<note>
	  <para>
	    This option may not be available in all Bugzilla installations, depending upon
	    the preferences of the systems administrator responsible for the setup of your Bugzilla.
	    However, if you really want this functionality, ask her to "enable watchers in Params".
	  </para>
	</note>
	<para>
	  By entering user email names into the "Users to watch" text entry box, delineated by commas,
	  you can watch bugs of other users.  This powerful functionality enables seamless transitions
	  as developers change projects, managers wish to get in touch with the issues faced by their
	  direct reports, or users go on vacation.  If any of these three situations apply
	  to you, you will undoubtedly find this feature quite convenient.
	</para>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section id="footersettings">
      <title>Page Footer</title>
      <note>
	<para>
	  By default, this page is quite barren.  However, go explore the Query Page some more; you will
	  find that you can store numerous queries on the server, so if you regularly run a particular query
	  it is just a drop-down menu away.  On this page of Preferences, if you have many stored
	  queries you can elect to have them always one-click away!
	</para>
      </note>
      <para>
	If you have many stored queries on the server, here you will find individual drop-downs for each
	stored query.  Each drop-down gives you the option of that query appearing on the footer of every
	page in Bugzilla!  This gives you powerful one-click access to any complex searches you may set up,
	and is an excellent way to impress your boss...
      </para>
      <tip>
	<para>By default, the "My Bugs" link appears at the bottom of each page.  However, this query
	gives you both the bugs you have reported, as well as those you are assigned.  One of the most
	common uses for this page is to remove the "My Bugs" link, replacing it with two other queries,
	commonly called "My Bug Reports" and "My Bugs" (but only referencing bugs assigned to you).  This
	allows you to distinguish those bugs you have reported from those you are assigned.  I commonly
	set up complex Boolean queries in the Query page and link them to my footer in this page.  When
	they are significantly complex, a one-click reference can save hours of work.</para>
      </tip>
    </section>
    <section id="permissionsettings">
      <title>Permissions</title>
      <para>
	This is a purely informative page which outlines your current permissions on
	this installation of Bugzilla.  If you have permissions to grant certain permissions to
	other users, the "other users" link appears on this page as well as the footer.
	For more information regarding user administration, please consult the Administration
	section of this Guide.
