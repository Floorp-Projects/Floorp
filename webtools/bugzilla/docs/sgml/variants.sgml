  <title>Bugzilla Variants and Competitors</title>
  <para>I created this section to answer questions about Bugzilla
    competitors and variants, then found a wonderful site which covers
    an awful lot of what I wanted to discuss.  Rather than quote it in
    its entirety, I'll simply refer you here: <ulink

    <title>Red Hat Bugzilla</title>
    <para>
      Red Hat Bugzilla is probably the most popular Bugzilla variant
      on the planet. One of the major benefits of Red Hat Bugzilla is
      the ability to work with Oracle, MySQL, and PostGreSQL databases
      serving as the back-end, instead of just MySQL.  Dave Lawrence
      has worked very hard to keep Red Hat Bugzilla up-to-date, and
      many people prefer the snappier-looking page layout of Red Hat
      Bugzilla to the default Mozilla-standard formatting.

  <section id="variant-fenris" xreflabel="Loki Bugzilla, a.k.a. Fenris">
    <title>Loki Bugzilla (Fenris)</title>
    <para>Fenris can be found at <ulink
					url="http://fenris.lokigames.com/">http://fenris.lokigames.com</ulink>.  It is a fork from Bugzilla.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="variant-issuezilla" xreflabel="Issuezilla">
    <title>Issuezilla</title>
    <para>Issuezilla is another fork from Bugzilla, and seems nearly
      as popular as the Red Hat Bugzilla fork.  Some Issuezilla team
      members are regular contributors to the Bugzilla mailing
      list/newsgroup.  Issuezilla is not the primary focus of
      bug-tracking at tigris.org, however.  Their Java-based
      bug-tracker, <xref linkend="variant-scarab" />, is under heavy development
      and looks promising!</para>

  <section id="variant-scarab" xreflabel="Scarab, a newfangled Java-based issue tracker">
    <title>Scarab</title>
    <para>Scarab is a promising new bug-tracking system built using
      Java Serlet technology.  As of this writing, no source code has
      been released as a package, but you can obtain the code from
      CVS.

    <title>Perforce SCM</title>
    <para>Although Perforce isn't really a bug tracker, it can be used
      as such through the <quote>jobs</quote> functionality.</para>

  <section id="variant-sourceforge" xreflabel="SourceForge">
    <title>SourceForge</title>
    <para>SourceForge is more of a way of coordinating geographically
      distributed free software and open source projects over the
      Internet than strictly a bug tracker, but if you're hunting for
      bug-tracking for your open project, it may be just what the
      software engineer ordered!</para>
