  <TITLE>Administering Bugzilla</TITLE>
<SUBTITLE>Or, I just got this cool thing installed.  Now what the heck do I do with it?</SUBTITLE>

<PARA>
So you followed the README isntructions to the letter, and
just logged into bugzilla with your super-duper god account and you are sitting at the query
screen. Yet, you have nothing to query. Your first act of bisuness needs to be to setup the
operating parameters for bugzilla.</PARA>

    <TITLE>Post-Installation Checklist</TITLE>
    <PARA>
      After installation, follow the checklist below to ensure that
      you have a successful installation.
      If you do not see a recommended setting for a parameter,
      consider leaving it at the default
      while you perform your initial tests on your Bugzilla setup.
    </PARA>
      <INDEXTERM>
	<PRIMARY>checklist</PRIMARY>
      </INDEXTERM>
    <PROCEDURE>
      <STEP>
	<PARA>
	  Set "maintainer" to <EMPHASIS>your</EMPHASIS> email address.
	  This allows Bugzilla's error messages
	  to display your email
	  address and allow people to contact you for help.
	</PARA>
      </STEP>
      <STEP>
	<PARA>
	  Set "urlbase" to the URL reference for your Bugzilla installation.
	  If your bugzilla query page is at http://www.foo.com/bugzilla/query.cgi,
	  your url base is http://www.foo.com/bugzilla/
	</PARA>
      </STEP>
      <STEP>
	<PARA>
	  Set "usebuggroups" to "1" <EMPHASIS>only</EMPHASIS>
	  if you need to restrict access to products.
	  I suggest leaving this parameter <EMPHASIS>off</EMPHASIS>
	  while initially testing your Bugzilla.
	</PARA>
      </STEP>
      <STEP>
	<PARA>
	  Set "usebuggroupsentry" to "1" if you want to be able to restrict access to products.
	  Once again, if you are simply testing your installation, I suggest against
	  turning this parameter on; the strict security checking may stop you from
	  being able to modify your new entries.
	</PARA>
      </STEP>
      <STEP>
        <PARA>
	  Set "shadowdb" to "bug_shadowdb" if you will be
	  running a *very* large installation of Bugzilla.
	  The shadow database enables many simultaneous users
	  to read and write to the database
	  without interfering with one another.  
	  <NOTE>
	    <PARA>
	      Enabling "shadowdb" can adversely affect the stability
	      of your installation of Bugzilla.
	      You may frequently need to manually synchronize your databases,
	      or schedule nightly syncs
	      via "cron"
	    </PARA>
	  </NOTE>
	  Once again, in testing you should
	  avoid this option -- use it if or when you <EMPHASIS>need</EMPHASIS> to use it, and have
	  repeatedly run into the problem it was designed to solve -- very long wait times while
	  attempting to commit a change to the database.
        </PARA>
	<PARA>
	  If you use the "shadowdb" option, it is only natural that you should turn the "queryagainstshadowdb"
	  option "On" as well.  Otherwise you are replicating data into a shadow database for no reason!
	</PARA>
      </STEP>
      <STEP>
        <PARA>
	  If you have custom logos or HTML you must put in place to fit within your site design guidelines,
	  place the code in the "headerhtml", "footerhtml", "errorhtml", "bannerhtml", or "blurbhtml" text boxes.
	  <NOTE>
	    <PARA>
	      The "headerhtml" text box is the HTML printed out <EMPHASIS>before</EMPHASIS> any other code on the page.
	      If you have a special banner, put the code for it in "bannerhtml".  You may want to leave these
	      settings at the defaults initially.
	    </PARA>
	  </NOTE>
	</PARA>
      </STEP>
      <STEP>
        <PARA>
	  Add any text you wish to the "passwordmail" parameter box.  For instance,
	  many people choose to use this box to give a quick training blurb about how to
	  use Bugzilla at your site.
        </PARA>
      </STEP>
      <STEP>
        <PARA>
	  Set "newemailtech" to "on".  Your users will thank you.  This is the default in the post-2.12 world.
	</PARA>
      </STEP>
      <STEP>
	<PARA>
	  Do you want to use the qa contact ("useqacontact") and status whiteboard ("usestatuswhiteboard") fields?
	  These fields are useful because they allow for more flexibility, particularly when you have an existing
	  Quality Assurance and/or Release Engineering team, 
	  but they may not be needed for smaller installations.
	</PARA>
      </STEP>
      <STEP>
	<PARA>
	  Set "whinedays" to the amount of days you want to let bugs go in the "New" or "Reopened" state before
	  notifying people they have untouched new bugs.  If you do not plan to use this feature, simply do
	  not set up the whining cron job described in the README, or set this value to "0".
	</PARA>
      </STEP>
      <STEP>
	<PARA>
	  Set the "commenton" options according to your site policy.  It is a wise idea to require comments when users
	  resolve, reassign, or reopen bugs.
	  <NOTE>
	    <PARA>
	      It is generally far better to require a developer comment when resolving bugs than not.
	      Few things are more annoying to bug database users than having a developer
	      mark a bug "fixed" without any comment as to what the fix was (or even that it was truly fixed!)
	    </PARA>
	  </NOTE>
	</PARA>
      </STEP>
      <STEP>
	<PARA>
	  Set "supportwatchers" to "On".  This feature is helpful for team leads to monitor progress in their
	  respective areas, and can offer many other benefits, such as allowing a developer to pick up a
	  former engineer's bugs without requiring her to change all the information in the bug.

	      <EMPHASIS>Editkeywords</EMPHASIS>: If you use Bugzilla's keyword functionality,

	      As always, the keywords for existing bugs containing the keyword
	      the user wishes to destroy must be changed before Bugzilla will allow it to die.
	      You must be very careful about creating too many new keywords
	      if you run a very large Bugzilla installation; keywords are global variables 
	      across products, and you can often run into a phenomenon called "keyword bloat".
	      This confuses users, and then the feature goes unused.
	    </PARA>
	  </LISTITEM>
	  <LISTITEM>
	    <PARA>
	      <EMPHASIS>Editusers</EMPHASIS>: This flag allows a user do what you're doing
	      right now: edit other users.
	      This will allow those with the right to do so to remove administrator
	      priveleges from other users or grant them to themselves.  Enable with care.

	      The user must still have the "editbugs" privelege to edit bugs in this area;
	      this simply restricts them from even seeing bugs outside these boundaries if the administrator
	      has enabled the group sentry parameter "usebuggroupsentry".  Unless you are using bug groups,
	      this option has no effect.

      <PARA>
	The concept of "voting" is a poorly understood, yet powerful feature for the management
	of open-source projects.  Each user is assigned so many Votes per product, which they can
	freely reassign (or assign multiple votes to a single bug).
	This allows developers to gauge user need for a particular enhancement
	or bugfix.  By allowing bugs with a certain number of votes to automatically move from
	"UNCONFIRMED" to "NEW", users of the bug system can help high-priority bugs garner
	attention so they don't sit for a long time awaiting triage.
      </PARA>
      <PARA>
	The daunting challenge of Votes is deciding where you draw the line for a "vocal majority".  If you
	only have a user base of 100 users, setting a low threshold for bugs to move from UNCONFIRMED
	to NEW makes sense.  As the Bugzilla user base expands, however, these thresholds must be
	re-evaluated.  You should gauge whether this feature is worth the time and close monitoring involved,
	and perhaps forego implementation until you have a critical mass of users who demand it.

      <TITLE>Groups and Group Security</TITLE>
      <PARA>
	Groups can be very useful in bugzilla, because they allow users to isolate
	bugs or products that should only be seen by certain people.  Groups can also
	be a complicated minefield of interdependencies and weirdness if mismanaged.

	<EXAMPLE>
	  <TITLE>When to Use Group Security</TITLE>
	  <INFORMALEXAMPLE>
	    <PARA>
	      Many Bugzilla sites isolate "Security-related" bugs from all other bugs.
	      This way, they can have a fix ready before the security vulnerability
	      is announced to the world.  You can create a "Security" product which, by
	      default, has no members, and only add members to the group (in their individual
	      User page, as described under User Administration) who should have
	      priveleged access to "Security" bugs.  Alternately, you may create a Group
	      independently of any Product, and change the Group mask on individual bugs
	      to restrict access to members only of certain Groups.
	    </PARA>
	  </INFORMALEXAMPLE>
	</EXAMPLE>
	
	Groups only work if you enable the "usebuggroups" paramater.
	In addition, if the "usebuggroupsentry" parameter is "On", one can restrict access
	to products by groups, so that only members of a product group are able to view
	bugs within that product.
	Group security in Bugzilla can be divided into two categories:
	Generic and Product-Based.
      </PARA>
      <NOTE>
	<PARA>
	  Groups in Bugzilla are a complicated beast that evolved out of very simple user
	  permission bitmasks, apparently itself derived from common concepts in UNIX access
	  controls.  A "bitmask" is a fixed-length number whose value can describe one, and
	  only one, set of states.  For instance, UNIX file permissions are assigned bitmask
	  values:  "execute" has a value of 1, "write" has a value of 2, 
	  and "read" has a value of 4.  Add them together,
	  and a file can be read, written to, and executed if it has a bitmask of "7". (This
	  is a simplified example -- anybody who knows UNIX security knows there is much
	  more to it than this.  Please bear with me for the purpose of this note.)  The only
	  way a bitmask scheme can work is by doubling the bit count for each value.  Thus
	  if UNIX wanted to offer another file permission, the next would have to be a value of
	  8, then the next 16, the next 32, etc.
	</PARA>
	<PARA>
	  Similarly, Bugzilla offers a bitmask to define group permissions, with an internal
	  limit of 64.  Several are already occupied
	  by built-in permissions.  The way around this limitation is
	  to avoid assigning groups to products if you have many products, avoid bloating
	  of group lists, and religiously prune irrelevant groups.  In reality, most installations
	  of Bugzilla support far fewer than 64 groups, so this limitation has not hit
	  for most sites, but it is on the table to be revised for Bugzilla 3.0
	  because it interferes with the security schemes of some administrators.
