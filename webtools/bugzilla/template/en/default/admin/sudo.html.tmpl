<p>
  The <b>sudo</b> feature of [% terms.Bugzilla %] allows you to impersonate a 
  user for a short time  While an sudo session is in progress, every action you 
  perform will be taking place as if you had logged in as the user whom will be 
  impersonating.
</p>

<p class="areyoureallyreallysure">
  This is a very powerful feature; you should be very careful while using it.  
  Your actions may be logged more carefully than normal.
</p>

<form action="relogin.cgi" method="POST">
  <p>
    To begin, 
    [% IF Param('usemenuforusers') %]
      select 
    [% ELSE %]
      enter the login of 
    [% END %]
    the <u>u</u>ser to impersonate:
    [% INCLUDE global/userselect.html.tmpl
       name => "target_login"
       value => "$target_login_default"
       accesskey => "u"
       size => 30
       multiple => 5
    %]
  </p>
  
  [% IF !Param('usemenuforusers') %]
    <p>
      The username must be entered exactly.  No matching will be performed.
    </p>
  [% END %]
  
  <p>
    Next, please take a moment to explain why you are doing this:<br>
    <input type="text" name="reason" size="80" maxlength="200">
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The message you enter here will be sent to the impersonated user by email.
    You may leave this empty if you wish, but they will still know that you 
    are impersonating them.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Finally, click the button to begin the session:
    <input type="submit" value="Begin Session">
    <input type="hidden" name="action" value="sudo-transition">
  </p>
  
  [% IF will_logout %]
    <p>
      When you press the button, you may be logged out and asked to log in 
      again.  This is done for two reasons.  First of all, it is done to reduce 
      the chances of someone doing large amounts of damage using your 
      already-logged-in account.  Second, it is there to force you to take the 
      time to consider if you really need to use this feature.
    </p>
