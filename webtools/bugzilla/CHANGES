will tell you what has been changed in the last week.


3/25/99 Unfortunately, the HTML::FromText CPAN module had too many bugs, and
so I had to roll my own.  We no longer use the HTML::FromText CPAN module.

3/24/99 (This entry has been removed.  It used to say that we required the
HTML::FromText CPAN module, but that's no longer true.)

3/22/99 Added the ability to query by fields which have changed within a date
range.  To make this perform a bit better, we need a new index:

	alter table bugs_activity add index (field);

3/10/99 Added 'groups' stuff, where we have different group bits that we can
put on a person or on a bug.  Some of the group bits control access to bugzilla
features.  And a person can't access a bug unless he has every group bit set
that is also set on the bug.  See the comments in makegroupstable.sh for a bit
more info.

The 'maintainer' param is now used only as an email address for people to send
complaints to.  The groups table is what is now used to determine permissions.

You will need to run the new script "makegroupstable.sh".  And then you need to
feed the following lines to MySQL (replace XXX with the login name of the
maintainer, the person you wish to be all-powerful).

	alter table bugs add column groupset bigint not null;
	alter table profiles add column groupset bigint not null;
	update profiles set groupset=0x7fffffffffffffff where login_name = XXX;



3/8/99 Added params to control how priorities are set in a new bug.  You can
now choose whether to let submitters of new bugs choose a priority, or whether
they should just accept the default priority (which is now no longer hardcoded
to "P2", but is instead a param.)  The default value of the params will cause
the same behavior as before.

3/3/99 Added a "disallownew" field to the products table.  If non-zero, then
don't let people file new bugs against this product.  (This is for when a 
product is retired, but you want to keep the bug reports around for posterity.)
Feed this to MySQL:

	alter table products add column disallownew tinyint not null;


2/8/99 Added FreeBSD to the list of OS's.  Feed this to MySQL:

	alter table bugs change column op_sys op_sys enum("All", "Windows 3.1", "Windows 95", "Windows 98", "Windows NT", "Mac System 7", "Mac System 7.5", "Mac System 7.6.1", "Mac System 8.0", "Mac System 8.5", "AIX", "BSDI", "HP-UX", "IRIX", "Linux", "FreeBSD", "OSF/1", "Solaris", "SunOS", "OS/2", "other") not null;


2/4/99 Added a new column "description" to the components table, and added 
links to a new page which will use this to describe the components of a 
given product.  Feed this to MySQL:

	alter table components add column description mediumtext not null;


2/3/99 Added a new column "initialqacontact" to the components table that gives
an initial QA contact field.  It may be empty if you wish the initial qa
contact to be empty.  If you're not using the QA contact field, you don't need
to add this column, but you might as well be safe and add it anyway:

	alter table components add column initialqacontact tinytext not null;


2/2/99 Added a new column "milestoneurl" to the products table that gives a URL
which is to describe the currently defined milestones for a product.  If you
don't use target milestone, you might be able to get away without adding this
column, but you might as well be safe and add it anyway:

	alter table products add column milestoneurl tinytext not null;


1/29/99 Whoops; had a mispelled op_sys.  It was "Mac System 7.1.6"; it should
be "Mac System 7.6.1".  It turns out I had no bugs with this value set, so I
could just do the below simple command.  If you have bugs with this value, you
may need to do something more complicated.

	alter table bugs change column op_sys op_sys enum("All", "Windows 3.1", "Windows 95", "Windows 98", "Windows NT", "Mac System 7", "Mac System 7.5", "Mac System 7.6.1", "Mac System 8.0", "Mac System 8.5", "AIX", "BSDI", "HP-UX", "IRIX", "Linux", "OSF/1", "Solaris", "SunOS", "OS/2", "other") not null;



1/20/99 Added new fields: Target Milestone, QA Contact, and Status Whiteboard.
These fields are all optional in the UI; there are parameters to turn them on.
However, whether or not you use them, the fields need to be in the DB.  There
is some code that needs them, even if you don't.

To update your DB to have these fields, send the following to MySQL:

        alter table bugs add column target_milestone varchar(20) not null,
                add column qa_contact mediumint not null,
                add column status_whiteboard mediumtext not null,
                add index (target_milestone), add index (qa_contact);



1/18/99 You can now query by CC.  To make this perform reasonably, the CC table
needs some indices.  The following MySQL does the necessary stuff:

	alter table cc add index (bug_id), add index (who);


1/15/99 The op_sys field can now be queried by (and more easily tweaked).
To make this perform reasonably, it needs an index.  The following MySQL 
command will create the necessary index:

	alter table bugs add index (op_sys);


12/2/98 The op_sys and rep_platform fields have been tweaked.  op_sys
is now an enum, rather than having the legal values all hard-coded in
perl.  rep_platform now no longer allows a value of "X-Windows".

Here's how I ported to the new world.  This ought to work for you too.
Actually, it's probably overkill.  I had a lot of illegal values for op_sys
in my tables, from importing bugs from strange places.  If you haven't done 
anything funky, then much of the below will be a no-op.

First, send the following commands to MySQL to make sure all your values for
rep_platform and op_sys are legal in the new world..

	update bugs set rep_platform="Sun" where rep_platform="X-Windows" and op_sys like "Solaris%";
	update bugs set rep_platform="SGI" where rep_platform="X-Windows" and op_sys = "IRIX";
	update bugs set rep_platform="SGI" where rep_platform="X-Windows" and op_sys = "HP-UX";
	update bugs set rep_platform="DEC" where rep_platform="X-Windows" and op_sys = "OSF/1";
	update bugs set rep_platform="PC" where rep_platform="X-Windows" and op_sys = "Linux";
	update bugs set rep_platform="other" where rep_platform="X-Windows";
	update bugs set rep_platform="other" where rep_platform="";
	update bugs set op_sys="Mac System 7" where op_sys="System 7";
	update bugs set op_sys="Mac System 7.5" where op_sys="System 7.5";
	update bugs set op_sys="Mac System 8.0" where op_sys="8.0";
	update bugs set op_sys="OSF/1" where op_sys="Digital Unix 4.0";
	update bugs set op_sys="IRIX" where op_sys like "IRIX %";
	update bugs set op_sys="HP-UX" where op_sys like "HP-UX %";
	update bugs set op_sys="Windows NT" where op_sys like "NT %";
	update bugs set op_sys="OSF/1" where op_sys like "OSF/1 %";
	update bugs set op_sys="Solaris" where op_sys like "Solaris %";
	update bugs set op_sys="SunOS" where op_sys like "SunOS%";
	update bugs set op_sys="other" where op_sys = "Motif";
	update bugs set op_sys="other" where op_sys = "Other";

Next, send the following commands to make sure you now have only legal
entries in your table.  If either of the queries do not come up empty, then
you have to do more stuff like the above.

	select bug_id,op_sys,rep_platform from bugs where rep_platform not regexp "^(All|DEC|HP|Macintosh|PC|SGI|Sun|X-Windows|Other)$";
	select bug_id,op_sys,rep_platform from bugs where op_sys not regexp "^(All|Windows 3.1|Windows 95|Windows 98|Windows NT|Mac System 7|Mac System 7.5|Mac System 7.1.6|Mac System 8.0|AIX|BSDI|HP-UX|IRIX|Linux|OSF/1|Solaris|SunOS|other)$";

Finally, once that's all clear, alter the table to make enforce the new legal
entries:

	alter table bugs change column op_sys op_sys enum("All", "Windows 3.1", "Windows 95", "Windows 98", "Windows NT", "Mac System 7", "Mac System 7.5", "Mac System 7.1.6", "Mac System 8.0", "AIX", "BSDI", "HP-UX", "IRIX", "Linux", "OSF/1", "Solaris", "SunOS", "other") not null, change column rep_platform rep_platform enum("All", "DEC", "HP", "Macintosh", "PC", "SGI", "Sun", "Other");





11/20/98 Added searching of CC field.  To better support this, added
some indexes to the CC table.  You probably want to execute the following
mysql commands:

	alter table cc add index (bug_id);
	alter table cc add index (who);


10/27/98 security check for legal products in place. bug charts are not
available as an option if collectstats.pl has never been run. all products 
get daily stats collected now. README updated: Chart::Base is listed as
a requirement, instructions for using collectstats.pl included as 
an optional step. also got silly and added optional quips to bug
reports. 

10/17/98 modified README installation instructions slightly. 

10/7/98 Added a new table called "products".  Right now, this is used
only to have a description for each product, and that description is
only used when initially adding a new bug.  Anyway, you *must* create
the new table (which you can do by running the new makeproducttable.sh
script).  If you just leave it empty, things will work much as they
did before, or you can add descriptions for some or all of your
products.


9/15/98 Everything has been ported to Perl.  NO MORE TCL.  This
transition should be relatively painless, except for the "params"
file.  This is the file that contains parameters you've set up on the
editparams.cgi page.  Before changing to Perl, this was a tcl-syntax
file, stored in the same directory as the code; after the change to
Perl, it becomes a perl-syntax file, stored in a subdirectory named
"data".  See the README file for more details on what version of Perl
you need.

So, if updating from an older version of Bugzilla, you will need to
edit data/param, change the email address listed for
$::param{'maintainer'}, and then go revisit the editparams.cgi page
and reset all the parameters to your taste.  Fortunately, your old
params file will still be around, and so you ought to be able to
cut&paste important bits from there.

Also, note that the "whineatnews" script has changed name (it now has
an extension of .pl instead of .tcl), so you'll need to change your
cron job.

And the "comments" file has been moved to the data directory.  Just do
"cat comments >> data/comments" to restore any old comments that may
have been lost.



9/2/98 Changed the way password validation works.  We now keep a
crypt'd version of the password in the database, and check against
that.  (This is silly, because we're also keeping the plaintext
version there, but I have plans...)  Stop passing the plaintext
password around as a cookie; instead, we have a cookie that references
a record in a new database table, logincookies.

IMPORTANT: if updating from an older version of Bugzilla, you must run
the following commands to keep things working:

 ./makelogincookiestable.sh
 echo "alter table profiles add column cryptpassword varchar(64);" | mysql bugs
 echo "update profiles set cryptpassword = encrypt(password,substring(rand(),3, 4));" | mysql bugs
