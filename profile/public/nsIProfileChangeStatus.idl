   /**
    * nsIObserver topics for profile changing. Profile changing happens in 5 phases
    * in the order given below. An observer may register separately for each phase
    * of the process depending on its needs. The subject passed to the observer's
    * Observe() method can be QI'd to an nsIProfileChangeStatus.
    *
    * PROFILE_APPROVE_CHANGE_TOPIC
    *   Called before a profile switch is attempted. Typically,
    *   the application level observer will ask the user if
    *   he/she wants to stop all network activity, close all open
    *   windows, etc. If the user says NO, the observer should
    *   call the subject's vetoChange(). If any observer does
    *   this, the profile will not be switched.
    *
    * PROFILE_CHANGE_TEARDOWN_TOPIC
    *   All async activity must be stopped in this phase. Typically,
    *   the application level observer will close all open windows. 
    *
    * PROFILE_BEFORE_CHANGE_TOPIC
    *   Called before the profile has changed. Use this notification
    *   to prepare for the profile being switched. If a component is
    *   holding any state which needs to be flushed to a profile-relative
    *   location, it should be done here.
    *
    * PROFILE_DO_CHANGE_TOPIC
    *   Called after the profile has changed. Do the work to
    *   respond to having a new profile. Any change which
    *   affects others must be done in this phase.
    *
    * PROFILE_AFTER_CHANGE_TOPIC
    *   Called after the profile has changed. Use this notification
    *   to make changes that are dependent on what some other listener
    *   did during its PROFILE_DO_CHANGE. For example, to respond to
    *   new preferences.
