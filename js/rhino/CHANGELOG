Changes since Rhino 1.6R5
=========================
- Added org.mozilla.javascript.PolicySecurityController as a concrete 
  implementation of an org.mozilla.javascript.SecurityController and the 
  preferred way of integrating with Java security architecture.
- When no security controller is in use, generated classes and scripts run in
  the ProtectionDomain of Rhino classes.
- Wrapped access to system properties and creation of class loaders into
  AccessController.doPrivileged() to nicely play in secured environments.
- Added implementation of __defineGetter__ and __defineSetter__ to match
  SpiderMonkey. __lookupGetter__ and __lookupSetter__ are not
  implemented, nor are the JS get and set keywords.  Also see #224334.

- Fixed #352319: Rhino threw a ClassCastException when a continuation captured
  from a catch() block was restarted.
