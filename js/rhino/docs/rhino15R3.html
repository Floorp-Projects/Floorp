<h3>Class writer API changes</h3>
Courtesy of Kemal Bayram.<br>
<br>
"The biggest change I've made is the replacement of ClassOutput with<br>
ClassRepository that has the single method:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public boolean storeClass(String className, byte[] classBytes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
boolean isTopLevel) throws IOException;<br>
<br>
This interface allows any arbitary storage method, such as a<br>
Hashtable/Map. In addition it also allows you to specify whether a<br>
class should be loaded, via returning true or false.&nbsp; You can still
use<br>
ClassOutput as I've coded an internal wrapper.<br>
<br>
With this interface it has also been possible to strip out the file<br>
saving code from Codegen and OptClassNameHelper.&nbsp; The file<br>
saving code is now an inner class FileClassRepository in Context. As<br>
a consequence of this&nbsp; I've stripped out some methods from ClassNameHelper.<br>
The resulting code is much more cleaner then before hand and everything<br>
still works as per usual.<br>
<br>
Other small additions are:<br>
&nbsp; o&nbsp; Annonymous functions are now named class$1 instead of class1<br>
&nbsp; o&nbsp; get/setClassName added to ClassNameHelper exposed in Context.
