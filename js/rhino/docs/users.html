How are people using Rhino?</h1></center>
Here's a partial list of the ways people are using Rhino in their projects.
The initial list was collected by Netscape marketing, so Rhino is referred
to as Netscape Java-based JavaScript. We'd love to hear how you're using
Rhino--just mail&nbsp;<script>document.write(owner());</script>.

<br>"Netscape JavaScript 1.5 with Java implementation was a perfect solution
for developing our MacroRecorder because it made our development process
faster and better, and our customers get a more efficient, reliable, and
standards based product as a result," said Rob Clark, Director of Product
Development at Attachmate. Attachmate integrates Netscape's Java-based
JavaScript 1.5 Interpreter into its 100% Pure Java certified web-to-host
thin clients, called e-Vantage Viewers. The Netscape Java-based JavaScript
interpreter is used in a MacroRecorder feature that allows browser-based
users to efficiently navigate host applications on mainframe and midrange
systems.

Aviva for Java is a mainframe connectivity product. To overcome the limitations of the arcane mainframe user interface, it is customary to provide scripting capabilities in such products, so that repetitive user actions can be automated.  Aviva for Java is a Java applet. As such, its size, security and compatibility requirements are strict. Rhino has been found to be the perfect scripting engine: pure Java, works perfectly in an applet environment, regardless of the VM vendor or version, it is light and in the same time very powerful.  JavaScript as the scripting language makes perfect sense in a browser environment.

<p><a href="http://www.bristowhill.com/">Bristow Hill Software</a>
<br>"We thought it would require lots of work to add scripting capability
to Bristow Hill Server Pages, but we were delighted to find that Netscape
JavaScript 1.5 with Java implementation fit right in with only a couple
of lines of initialization code and one line of code to export our standard
objects by name. Also, we were pleased to find we could take embedded scripting
and compile it down to Java classes which could be used directly for greater
speed in production. Netscape's JavaScript engine is rock solid and standards
compliant, and my only regret is that we didn't start using it sooner,"
said Don Anderson, President of Bristow Hill Software.

<p><a href="http://www.icesoft.com/">ICEsoft Technologies</a>
<br>ICEsoft Technologies adds JavaScript support to their browser products using Rhino.

<p><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/pcbeard/JShell/">JShell</a>
<br>Rhino is used as the scripting language for the open source command
shell JShell written by Patrick Beard.

<p><a href="http://www.runitsoft.com/">RUnit Software</a>
<br>RUnit Software uses Rhino as part of
solutions for business-process automation, for example
when the automation involves communicating with a
web-interface. RUnit Software employs one of Rhino's maintainers, <script>write_email("Igor Bukanov", "igor", "runitsoft.com")</script> and  offers <a href="http://www.runitsoft.com/#javascript">consultancy services</a> for using and integrating Rhino. 

<p><a href="http://www.tdiinc.com/">Technology Deployment International</a>
<br>"Technology Deployment International selected the Java-based Netscape
JavaScript engine to incorporate into the workflow module of our eBusiness
Management System (eBMS) allowing our customers to integrate business logic
into any workstep of their application," said Dr. Kelvin Liu, VP eBMS Development,
Technology Deployment International. "It has been easy to embed, the support
we received from the engineering team has been outstanding, and the performance
of the JavaScript code is almost identical to the equivalent Java."

<p><a href="http://www.xypoint.com/">XYPOINT</a>
<br>XYPOINT uses Rhino for automating test cases of their Java classes
used in their service <a href="http://www.webwirelessnow.com/">WebWirelessNow</a>.
Abraham Backus says that he's happy with Rhino because "I've always wanted
this kind of JavaScript support."
