<h1 align="center">Rhino 1.5 Release 4.1 Change Log</h1>

1.5R4.1 is a bug fix release to address mostly regressions from 1.5R3 found in 1.5R4. The only visible API change compared with 1.5R4 is two new methods in <tt>org.mozilla.javascript.Context</tt>,  <tt>getApplicationClassLoader()</tt> and <tt>setApplicationClassLoader(ClasssLoader)</tt>. They allow to control the class loader Rhino uses when accessing application classes. 
<p>
For differences between 1.5R4 and 1.5R3, see <a href="rhino15R4.html">1.5R4 change log</a>.
