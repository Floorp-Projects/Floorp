# Normally DIRS should contain all sub-dirs, but this
# directory was built to organize code rather than to
# reflect build order.
#
# Thus on the first pass we build the core classes and the
# top-level Makefile will control the order of subsequent
# directories by going directly into the specific directories
#
# The proper way to do this would be to introduce different
# stages into the java code build cycle, but that has the
# potential to introduce too many changes
#
# This is necessary to break circular dependencies the logical
# tree directory structure would otherwise introduce.
#
# See top-level makefile for details
