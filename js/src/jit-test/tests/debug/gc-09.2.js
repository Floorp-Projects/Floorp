// Bug 717104 - Unreachable debuggee globals should not keep their debuggers
// alive. The loop is to defeat conservative stack scanning; if the same stack
// locations are used each time through the loop, at least three of the
// debuggers should be collected.
//
// This is a slight modification of gc-09.js, which contains a cycle.
