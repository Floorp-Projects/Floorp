/*
 * This code implements an incremental mark-and-sweep garbage collector, with
 * most sweeping carried out in the background on a parallel thread.
 *
 * Full vs. zone GC
 * ----------------
 *
 * The collector can collect all zones at once, or a subset. These types of
 * collection are referred to as a full GC and a zone GC respectively.
 *
 * The atoms zone is only collected in a full GC since objects in any zone may
 * have pointers to atoms, and these are not recorded in the cross compartment
 * pointer map. Also, the atoms zone is not collected if any thread has an
 * AutoKeepAtoms instance on the stack, or there are any exclusive threads using
 * the runtime.
 *
 * It is possible for an incremental collection that started out as a full GC to
 * become a zone GC if new zones are created during the course of the
 * collection.
 *
 * Incremental collection
 * ----------------------
 *
 * For a collection to be carried out incrementally the following conditions
 * must be met:
 *  - the collection must be run by calling js::GCSlice() rather than js::GC()
 *  - the GC mode must have been set to JSGC_MODE_INCREMENTAL with
 *    JS_SetGCParameter()
 *  - no thread may have an AutoKeepAtoms instance on the stack
 *  - all native objects that have their own trace hook must indicate that they
 *    implement read and write barriers with the JSCLASS_IMPLEMENTS_BARRIERS
 *    flag
 *
 * The last condition is an engine-internal mechanism to ensure that incremental
 * collection is not carried out without the correct barriers being implemented.
 * For more information see 'Incremental marking' below.
 *
 * If the collection is not incremental, all foreground activity happens inside
 * a single call to GC() or GCSlice(). However the collection is not complete
 * until the background sweeping activity has finished.
 *
 * An incremental collection proceeds as a series of slices, interleaved with
 * mutator activity, i.e. running JavaScript code. Slices are limited by a time
 * budget. The slice finishes as soon as possible after the requested time has
 * passed.
 *
 * Collector states
 * ----------------
 *
 * The collector proceeds through the following states, the current state being
 * held in JSRuntime::gcIncrementalState:
 *
 *  - MARK_ROOTS - marks the stack and other roots
 *  - MARK       - incrementally marks reachable things
 *  - SWEEP      - sweeps zones in groups and continues marking unswept zones
 *
 * The MARK_ROOTS activity always takes place in the first slice. The next two
 * states can take place over one or more slices.
 *
 * In other words an incremental collection proceeds like this:
 *
 * Slice 1:   MARK_ROOTS: Roots pushed onto the mark stack.
 *            MARK:       The mark stack is processed by popping an element,
 *                        marking it, and pushing its children.
 *
 *          ... JS code runs ...
 *
 * Slice 2:   MARK:       More mark stack processing.
 *
 *          ... JS code runs ...
 *
 * Slice n-1: MARK:       More mark stack processing.
 *
 *          ... JS code runs ...
 *
 * Slice n:   MARK:       Mark stack is completely drained.
 *            SWEEP:      Select first group of zones to sweep and sweep them.
 *
 *          ... JS code runs ...
 *
 * Slice n+1: SWEEP:      Mark objects in unswept zones that were newly
 *                        identified as alive (see below). Then sweep more zone
 *                        groups.
 *
 *          ... JS code runs ...
 *
 * Slice n+2: SWEEP:      Mark objects in unswept zones that were newly
 *                        identified as alive. Then sweep more zone groups.
 *
 *          ... JS code runs ...
 *
 * Slice m:   SWEEP:      Sweeping is finished, and background sweeping
 *                        started on the helper thread.
 *
 *          ... JS code runs, remaining sweeping done on background thread ...
 *
 * When background sweeping finishes the GC is complete.
 *
 * Incremental marking
 * -------------------
 *
 * Incremental collection requires close collaboration with the mutator (i.e.,
 * JS code) to guarantee correctness.
 *
 *  - During an incremental GC, if a memory location (except a root) is written
 *    to, then the value it previously held must be marked. Write barriers
 *    ensure this.
 *
 *  - Any object that is allocated during incremental GC must start out marked.
 *
 *  - Roots are marked in the first slice and hence don't need write barriers.
 *    Roots are things like the C stack and the VM stack.
 *
 * The problem that write barriers solve is that between slices the mutator can
 * change the object graph. We must ensure that it cannot do this in such a way
 * that makes us fail to mark a reachable object (marking an unreachable object
 * is tolerable).
 *
 * We use a snapshot-at-the-beginning algorithm to do this. This means that we
 * promise to mark at least everything that is reachable at the beginning of
 * collection. To implement it we mark the old contents of every non-root memory
 * location written to by the mutator while the collection is in progress, using
 * write barriers. This is described in gc/Barrier.h.
 *
 * Incremental sweeping
 * --------------------
 *
 * Sweeping is difficult to do incrementally because object finalizers must be
 * run at the start of sweeping, before any mutator code runs. The reason is
 * that some objects use their finalizers to remove themselves from caches. If
 * mutator code was allowed to run after the start of sweeping, it could observe
 * the state of the cache and create a new reference to an object that was just
 * about to be destroyed.
 *
 * Sweeping all finalizable objects in one go would introduce long pauses, so
 * instead sweeping broken up into groups of zones. Zones which are not yet
 * being swept are still marked, so the issue above does not apply.
 *
 * The order of sweeping is restricted by cross compartment pointers - for
 * example say that object |a| from zone A points to object |b| in zone B and
 * neither object was marked when we transitioned to the SWEEP phase. Imagine we
 * sweep B first and then return to the mutator. It's possible that the mutator
 * could cause |a| to become alive through a read barrier (perhaps it was a
 * shape that was accessed via a shape table). Then we would need to mark |b|,
 * which |a| points to, but |b| has already been swept.
 *
 * So if there is such a pointer then marking of zone B must not finish before
 * marking of zone A.  Pointers which form a cycle between zones therefore
 * restrict those zones to being swept at the same time, and these are found
 * using Tarjan's algorithm for finding the strongly connected components of a
 * graph.
 *
 * GC things without finalizers, and things with finalizers that are able to run
 * in the background, are swept on the background thread. This accounts for most
 * of the sweeping work.
 *
 * Reset
 * -----
 *
 * During incremental collection it is possible, although unlikely, for
 * conditions to change such that incremental collection is no longer safe. In
 * this case, the collection is 'reset' by ResetIncrementalGC(). If we are in
 * the mark state, this just stops marking, but if we have started sweeping
 * already, we continue until we have swept the current zone group. Following a
 * reset, a new non-incremental collection is started.
