The js/ref directory contains standalone ANSI-C source for the Netscape
JavaScript Reference implementation, JSRef, which is licensed to over 160
companies.

The js/src directory contains source files listed in the file "commfiles",
that are derived via prconv.sed from counterparts in the js/ref directory.
It also contains files such as jsjava.c that are not in js/ref yet.  The
Makefile in js/src has refconv and refdiff targets to help keep js/ref and
js/src in synch.

If you think you need to change a file listed in commfiles here, please let
us know by mailing jsengteam first.
