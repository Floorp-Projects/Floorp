# Because adding a configure file in the tree is going to conflict with

# because some automation jobs are still running autoconf and configure
# "manually", this file is actually an m4 file that is processed by
# autoconf, but doesn't call any autoconf macros. The `divert` line
# below ensures the script that follows is output by autoconf.
