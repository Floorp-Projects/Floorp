/* jband - 03/06/01 - Stuff to do soon */

- FIX these things:
    ! FIX resolve in setProperty brendan bug 72354
    - FIX nested enumerate with scriptable helper
    - FIX xpccomponets.cpp use of scriptable to deal better with prototype use

- FEATURES
    - followup with shaver on classinfo maps (shared with table driven QI?)
    - deal with shaver's string changes
    ? add HasInstance (or whatever) to nsIClassInfo

- VERIFY these things:
    - VERIFY that locking work is DONE.
    - VERIFY that scriptable flags are being honored
    - VERIFY that we honor nsIClassInfo flags
    - VERIFY cleanup of unused stuff
    - VERIFY only share protos if scriptable flag says so.

- FOORPRINT & PERFORMANCE
    ? look into optional hashtable in interface sets
        FWIW, I'm thinking this is likely to not be a real win (and will 
        certainly have a cost).
        The JS engine caches the bulk of such lookups for us anyway.

- CODE MAINTAINABILITY
    - more code comments

- CODE INSTRUMENTATION
    - improve DebugDump stuff
    - more stats gathering/reporting code
    ? debug code to point out *use* of potentially shadowed members
    - add code to discover QIable interfaces not mentioned in nsIClassInfo

- TESTS - we need tests for:
    - look into hooking up to JS test suite
    - use what can be used from cbegle's xpconnect tests
    - add multi-threaded tests

- DOCS
    - update typelib spec ([astring] and [function])
    - xpconnect api docs
    - discussion of flattening and implications
    - add to the faqs
