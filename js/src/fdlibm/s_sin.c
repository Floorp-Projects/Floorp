/* sin(x)
 * Return sine function of x.
 *
 * kernel function:
 *	__kernel_sin		... sine function on [-pi/4,pi/4]
 *	__kernel_cos		... cose function on [-pi/4,pi/4]
 *	__ieee754_rem_pio2	... argument reduction routine
 *
 * Method.
 *      Let S,C and T denote the sin, cos and tan respectively on 
 *	[-PI/4, +PI/4]. Reduce the argument x to y1+y2 = x-k*pi/2 
 *	in [-pi/4 , +pi/4], and let n = k mod 4.
 *	We have
 *
 *          n        sin(x)      cos(x)        tan(x)
 *     ----------------------------------------------------------
 *	    0	       S	   C		 T
 *	    1	       C	  -S		-1/T
 *	    2	      -S	  -C		 T
 *	    3	      -C	   S		-1/T
 *     ----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Special cases:
 *      Let trig be any of sin, cos, or tan.
 *      trig(+-INF)  is NaN, with signals;
 *      trig(NaN)    is that NaN;
 *
 * Accuracy:
 *	TRIG(x) returns trig(x) nearly rounded
