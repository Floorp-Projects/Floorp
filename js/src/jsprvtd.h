 * This header is included only in other .h files, for convenience and for
 * simplicity of type naming.  The alternative for structures is to use tags,
 * which are named the same as their typedef names (legal in C/C++, and less
 * noisy than suffixing the typedef name with "Struct" or "Str").  Instead,
 * all .h files that include this file may use the same typedef name, whether
 * declaring a pointer to struct type, or defining a member of struct type.
 *
 * A few fundamental scalar types are defined here too.  Neither the scalar
 * nor the struct typedefs should change much, therefore the nearly-global
 * make dependency induced by this file should not prove painful.

 * This hook captures high level script execution and function calls (JS or
 * native).  It is used by JS_SetExecuteHook to hook top level scripts and by
 * JS_SetCallHook to hook function calls.  It will get called twice per script
 * or function call: just before execution begins and just after it finishes.
 * In both cases the 'current' frame is that of the executing code.
 *
 * The 'before' param is JS_TRUE for the hook invocation before the execution
 * and JS_FALSE for the invocation after the code has run.
 *
 * The 'ok' param is significant only on the post execution invocation to
 * signify whether or not the code completed 'normally'.
 *
 * The 'closure' param is as passed to JS_SetExecuteHook or JS_SetCallHook
 * for the 'before'invocation, but is whatever value is returned from that
 * invocation for the 'after' invocation. Thus, the hook implementor *could*
 * allocate a stucture in the 'before' invocation and return a pointer to that
 * structure. The pointer would then be handed to the hook for the 'after'
 * invocation. Alternately, the 'before' could just return the same value as
 * in 'closure' to cause the 'after' invocation to be called with the same
 * 'closure' value as the 'before'.
 *
 * Returning NULL in the 'before' hook will cause the 'after' hook *not* to
 * be called.
