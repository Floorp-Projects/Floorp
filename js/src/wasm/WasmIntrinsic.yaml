# The file contains information need to define wasm intrinsic operations.

# i8vecmul(dest: i32, src1: i32, src2: i32, len: i32)
#  Performs pairwise multiplication of two i8 vectors of 'len' specified at
#  'src1' and 'src2'. Output is written to 'dest'. This is used as a
#  basic self-test for intrinsics.
