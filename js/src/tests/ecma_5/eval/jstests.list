#
# A dazzling variety of characteristics of an invocation of the eval function
# affect its semantics:
#
#  - Is it called from a function (one written by the user, or one provided by
#    ES5), from global code, or from nothing (e.g. setTimeout, setInterval, or
#    at the entry point to the JSAPI)?
#  - If it is called from script (whether global or function), is the caller
#    strict mode code?
#  - Is the call direct or indirect?  (ES5 15.1.2.1)
#  - Is the eval code itself strict mode?
#
# We test all of these in their basic configurations in an attempt to verify
# correct general behavior.  These tests won't help any special-case
# optimizations we might perform -- add new tests for such changes as needed.

# Not written yet!  These require a new shell primitive to work there, though
