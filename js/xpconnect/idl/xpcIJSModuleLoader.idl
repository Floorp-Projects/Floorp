   * properties on 'targetObj', or, if 'targetObj' is not specified,
   * on the caller's global object. If 'EXPORTED_SYMBOLS' is not
   * found, an error is thrown.
   *
   * @param resourceURI A resource:// URI string to load the module from.
   * @param targetObj  the object to install the exported properties on.
   *        If this parameter is a primitive value, this method throws
   *        an exception.
   * @returns the module code's global object.
   *
   * The implementation maintains a hash of registryLocation->global obj.
   * Subsequent invocations of importModule with 'registryLocation'
   * pointing to the same file will not cause the module to be re-evaluated,
   * but the symbols in EXPORTED_SYMBOLS will be exported into the
   * specified target object and the global object returned as above.
