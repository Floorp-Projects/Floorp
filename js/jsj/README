This directory contains the implementation of LiveConnect, which is
the marketing term for the glue between Java and JavaScript that
allows each language implementation to access the methods and fields
of the other one.

This code relies heavily on unpublished APIs to Netscape's Java VM and
hence will not work with any other VM.  A new version is currently
being crafted that does not use these hooks, but instead makes use of
the Java Native Interface (JNI), which is JavaSoft's defined way of
communicating with a Java VM.  (This code does not use JNI because it
predates the JNI and JNI's predecessor, JRI.)
