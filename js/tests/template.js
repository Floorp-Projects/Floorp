     * Calls to AddTestCase here. AddTestCase is a function that is defined

     * - a string representation of what is being tested
     * - the expected result
     * - the actual result
     *
     * For example, a test might look like this:
     *
     * var zip = /[\d]{5}$/;
     *
     * AddTestCase(
     * "zip = /[\d]{5}$/; \"PO Box 12345 Boston, MA 02134\".match(zip)",   // description of the test
     *  "02134",                                                           // expected result
     *  "PO Box 12345 Boston, MA 02134".match(zip) );                      // actual result
