# powermetrics

`powermetrics` is a Mac-only command-line utility that provides many
high-quality power-related measurements. It is most useful for getting
CPU, GPU and wakeup measurements in a precise and easily scriptable
fashion (unlike [Activity Monitor and
top](activity_monitor_and_top.md))
especially in combination with
[rapl](tools_power_rapl.md) via the
`mach power` command. This document describes the version of
`powermetrics` that comes with Mac OS 10.10. The one that comes with
10.9 is less powerful.

**Note**: The [power profiling
overview](power_profiling_overview.md) is
worth reading at this point if you haven\'t already. It may make parts
of this document easier to understand.

## Quick start

`powermetrics` provides a vast number of measurements. The following
command encompasses the most useful ones:

sudo powermetrics --samplers tasks --show-process-coalition --show-process-gpu -n 1 -i 5000

-   `--samplers tasks` tells it to just do per-process measurements.
-   `--show-process-coalition`` `tells it to group *coalitions* of
    related processes, e.g. the Firefox parent process and child
    processes.
-   `--show-process-gpu` tells it to show per-process GPU measurements.
-   `-n 1` tells it to take one sample and then stop.
-   `-i 5000` tells it to use a sample length of 5 seconds (5000 ms).
    Change this number to get shorter or longer samples.

The following is example output from such an invocation:

This sample was taken while the following programs were running:

-   Firefox Beta (single process, invoked from the Mac OS dock, shown in
    the `org.mozilla.firefox` coalition.)
-   Firefox Nightly (multi-process, invoked from the command line, shown
    in the `com.apple.Terminal` coalition.)
-   Google Chrome.
-   Safari.

The grouping of parent and child processes (in coalitions) is obvious.
The meaning of the columns is as follows.

-   **Name**: Coalition/process name. Process names within coalitions
    are indented.
-   **ID**: Coalition/process ID number.
-   **CPU ms/s**: CPU time used by the coalition/process, per second,
    during the sample period. The sum of the process values typically
    exceeds the coalition value slightly, for unknown reasons.
-   **User%**: Percentage of that CPU time spent in user space (as
    opposed to kernel mode.)
-   **Deadlines (\<2 ms, 2-5 ms)**: These two columns count how many
    \"short\" timers woke up threads in the process, per second, during
    the sample period. High frequency timers, which typically have short
    time-to-deadlines, can cause high power consumption and should be
    avoided if possible.
-   **Wakeups (Intr, Pkg idle)**: These two columns count how many
    wakeups occurred, per second, during the sample period. The first
    column counts interrupt-level wakeups that resulted in a thread
    being dispatched in the process. The second column counts \"package
    idle exit\" wakeups, which wake up the entire package as opposed to
    just a single core; such wakeups are particularly expensive, and
    this count is a subset of the first column\'s count.
-   **GPU ms/s**: GPU time used by the coalition/process, per second,
    during the sample period.

Other things to note.

-   Smaller is better --- i.e. results in lower power consumption ---
    for all of these measurements.
-   There is some overlap between the two \"Deadlines\" columns and the
    two \"Wakeups\" columns. For example, firing a single sub-2ms
    deadline can also cause a package idle exit wakeup.
-   Many of these measurements are also obtainable by passing the
    `TASK_POWER_INFO` flag and a `task_power_info` struct to the
    `task_info` function.
-   By default, the coalitions/processes are sorted by a composite value
    computed from several factors, though this can be changed via
    command-line options.

## Other measurements

`powermetrics` can also report measurements of backlight usage, network
activity, disk activity, interrupt distribution, device power states,
C-state residency, P-state residency, quality of service classes, and
thermal pressure. These are less likely to be useful for profiling
Firefox, however. Run with the `--show-all` to see all of these at once,
but note that you\'ll need a very wide window to see all the data.

Also note that `powermetrics -h` is a better guide to the the
command-line options than `man powermetrics`.

## mach power

You can use the `mach power` command to run `powermetrics` in
combination with `rapl` in a way that gives the most useful summary
measurements for each of Firefox, Chrome and Safari. The following is
sample output.

        total W = _pkg_ (cores + _gpu_ + other) + _ram_ W
    #01 17.14 W = 14.98 ( 5.50 +  1.19 +  8.29) +  2.16 W

The `rapl` output is first, then the `powermetrics` output. As well as
the browser processes, the `WindowServer` and kernel tasks are shown
because browsers often trigger significant load in them.

The default sample period is 30,000 milliseconds (30 seconds), but that
can be changed with the `-i` option.
