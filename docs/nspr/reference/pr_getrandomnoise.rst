PR_GetRandomNoise
=================

Produces a random value for use as a seed value for another random
number generator.


Syntax
------

.. code:: eval

   #include <prrng.h>

   NSPR_API(PRSize) PR_GetRandomNoise(
      void    *buf,
      PRSize  size
   );


Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

The function has these parameters:

``buf``
   A pointer to a caller-supplied buffer to contain the generated random
   number. ``buf`` must be at least as large as specified in ``size``.

``size``
   The size, in bytes, of the requested random number.


Returns
~~~~~~~

:ref:`PRSize` value equal to the size of the random number actually
generated, or zero. The generated size may be less than the size
requested. A return value of zero means that :ref:`PR_GetRandomNoise` is
not implemented on this platform, or there is no available noise to be
returned at the time of the call.


Description
-----------

:ref:`PR_GetRandomNoise` provides a random value, depending on platform.
The length of the random value is dependent on the platform and its
ability to provide a random value at that moment.

:ref:`PR_GetRandomNoise` is intended to provide a "seed" value for a
another random number generator that may be suitable for cryptographic
operations. This implies that the random value provided may not be, by
itself, cryptographically secure. The value generated by
:ref:`PR_GetRandomNoise` is at best, extremely difficult to predict and is
as nondeterministic as the underlying platform permits.
