PR_VersionCheck
===============

Compares the version of NSPR assumed by the caller (the imported
version) with the version being offered by the runtime (the exported
version).


Syntax
------

.. code:: eval

   #include <prinit.h>

   PRBool PR_VersionCheck(const char *importedVersion);


Parameter
~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`PR_VersionCheck` has one parameter:

``importedVersion``
   The version of the shared library being imported.


Returns
~~~~~~~

The function returns one of the following values:

-  If the version of the shared library is compatible with that expected
   by the caller, ``PR_TRUE``.
-  If the versions are not compatible, ``PR_FALSE``.


Description
-----------

:ref:`PR_VersionCheck` tests whether the version of the library being
imported (``importedVersion``) is compatible with the running version of
the shared library. This is a string comparison of sorts, though the
details of the comparison will vary over time.
