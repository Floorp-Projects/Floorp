PR_AcceptRead
=============

Accepts a new connection and receives a block of data.


Syntax
------

.. code:: eval

   #include <prio.h>

   PRInt32 PR_AcceptRead(
     PRFileDesc *listenSock,
     PRFileDesc **acceptedSock,
     PRNetAddr **peerAddr,
     void *buf,
     PRInt32 amount,
     PRIntervalTime timeout);


Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

The function has the following parameters:

``listenSock``
   A pointer to a :ref:`PRFileDesc` object representing a socket descriptor
   that has been called with the :ref:`PR_Listen` function, also known as
   the rendezvous socket.
``acceptedSock``
   A pointer to a pointer to a :ref:`PRFileDesc` object. On return,
   ``*acceptedSock`` points to the :ref:`PRFileDesc` object for the newly
   connected socket. This parameter is valid only if the function return
   does not indicate failure.
``peerAddr``
   A pointer a pointer to a :ref:`PRNetAddr` object. On return,
   ``peerAddr`` points to the address of the remote socket. The
   :ref:`PRNetAddr` object that ``peerAddr`` points to will be in the
   buffer pointed to by ``buf``. This parameter is valid only if the
   function return does not indicate failure.
``buf``
   A pointer to a buffer to hold data sent by the peer and the peer's
   address. This buffer must be large enough to receive ``amount`` bytes
   of data and two :ref:`PRNetAddr` structures (thus allowing the runtime
   to align the addresses as needed).
``amount``
   The number of bytes of data to receive. Does not include the size of
   the :ref:`PRNetAddr` structures. If 0, no data will be read from the
   peer.
``timeout``
   The timeout interval only applies to the read portion of the
   operation. :ref:`PR_AcceptRead` blocks indefinitely until the connection
   is accepted; the read will time out after the timeout interval
   elapses.


Returns
~~~~~~~

-  A positive number indicates the number of bytes read from the peer.
-  The value -1 indicates a failure. The reason for the failure can be
   obtained by calling :ref:`PR_GetError`.


Description
-----------

:ref:`PR_AcceptRead` accepts a new connection and retrieves the newly
created socket's descriptor and the connecting peer's address. Also, as
its name suggests, :ref:`PR_AcceptRead` receives the first block of data
sent by the peer.
