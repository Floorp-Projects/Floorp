PRIntn
======

This type is one of the most appropriate for automatic variables. It is
guaranteed to be at least 16 bits, though various architectures may
define it to be wider (for example, 32 or even 64 bits). This types is
never valid for fields of a structure.


Syntax

.. code:: eval

   #include <prtypes.h>
