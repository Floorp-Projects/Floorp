   source.
``sendto``
   Send bytes to specified network address.
``poll``
   Test the file descriptor to see if it is ready for I/O.
``acceptread``
   Accept and read from a new network file descriptor.
``transmitfile``
   Transmit an entire file to the specified socket.
``getsockname``
   Get network address associated with a file descriptor.

``setsockopt``
   Set value of specified socket option.


Description
-----------

You don't need to know the type declaration for each function listed in
the method table unless you are implementing a layer. For information
about each function, see the corresponding function description in this
document. For example, the ``write`` method in :ref:`PRIOMethods`
implements the :ref:`PR_Write` function. For type definition details, see
``prio.h``.

The I/O methods table provides procedural access to the functions of the
file descriptor. It is the responsibility of a layer implementor to
provide suitable functions at every entry point (that is, for every
function in the I/O methods table). If a layer provides no
functionality, it should call the next lower (higher) function of the
same name (for example, the "close" method would return
``fd->lower->method->close(fd->lower)``).

Not all functions in the methods table are implemented for all types of
files. For example, the seek method is implemented for normal files but
not for sockets. In cases where this partial implementation occurs, the
function returns an error indication with an error code of
``PR_INVALID_METHOD_ERROR``.
