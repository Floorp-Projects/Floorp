PR_Now
======

Returns the current time.


Syntax
------

.. code:: eval

   #include <prtime.h>

   PRTime PR_Now(void);


Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

None.


Returns
~~~~~~~

The current time as a :ref:`PRTime` value.


Description
-----------

``PR_Now()`` returns the current time as number of microseconds since
the NSPR epoch, which is midnight (00:00:00) 1 January 1970 UTC.

You cannot assume that the values returned by ``PR_Now()`` are
monotonically increasing because the system clock of the computer may be
reset. To obtain monotonically increasing time stamps suitable for
measuring elapsed time, use ``PR_IntervalNow()``.
