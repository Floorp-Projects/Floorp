PR_SendTo
=========

Sends bytes a socket to a specified destination.


Syntax
------

.. code:: eval

   #include <prio.h>

   PRInt32 PR_SendTo(
     PRFileDesc *fd,
     const void *buf,
     PRInt32 amount,
     PRIntn flags,
     const PRNetAddr *addr,
     PRIntervalTime timeout);


Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

The function has the following parameters:

``fd``
   A pointer to a :ref:`PRFileDesc` object representing a socket.
``buf``
   A pointer to a buffer containing the data to be sent.
``amount``
   The size of ``buf`` (in bytes).
``flags``
   This obsolete parameter must always be zero.
``addr``
   A pointer to the address of the destination.
``timeout``
   A value of type :ref:`PRIntervalTime` specifying the time limit for
   completion of the receive operation.


Returns
~~~~~~~

The function returns one of the following values:

-  A positive number indicates the number of bytes successfully sent.
-  The value -1 indicates a failure. The reason for the failure can be
   obtained by calling :ref:`PR_GetError`.


Description
-----------

:ref:`PR_SendTo` sends a specified number of bytes from a socket to the
specified destination address. The calling thread blocks until all bytes
are sent, a timeout has occurred, or there is an error.
