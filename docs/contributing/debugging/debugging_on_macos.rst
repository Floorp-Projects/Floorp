Debugging On macOS
==================

This document explains how to debug Gecko-based applications such as
Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey on macOS using Xcode. If you want to
debug from the terminal see :ref:`Debugging Mozilla with
lldb <Debugging Firefox with LLDB>`. For specific
information on a way to debug hangs, see :ref:`Debugging a hang on macOS <Debugging A Hang On macOS>`.

Creating a debuggable build
---------------------------

First, you need to build the application you're going to debug using
this in your .mozconfig

.. code::

   --disable-optimize
   --enable-debug-symbols

you can also add this flag if you want assertions etc. compiled in

.. code::

   --enable-debug

See :ref:`Building Firefox for macOS <Building Firefox On MacOS>`
if you need help creating your own build.

Debugging Firefox on macOS 10.14+
---------------------------------

macOS 10.14 introduced Notarization and Hardened Runtime features for
improved application security. macOS 10.15 went further, requiring
applications to be Notarized with Hardened Runtime enabled in order to
launch (ignoring workarounds). When run on earlier macOS versions,
Notarization and Hardened Runtime settings have no effect.

Official Builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this time, official builds of Firefox 69 and later are Notarized.
**As a result, it is not possible to attach a debugger to these official
Firefox releases on macOS 10.14+ without disabling System Integrity
Protection (SIP).** This is due to Notarization requiring Hardened
Runtime to be enabled with the ``com.apple.security.get-task-allow``
entitlement disallowed. **Rather than disabling SIP (which has security
implications), it is recommended to debug with try builds or local
builds. The differences are explained below.**

try Server Builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In most cases, developers needing to debug a build as close as possible
to the production environment should use a :ref:`try
build <Pushing to Try>`. These
builds enable Hardened Runtime and only differ from production builds in
that they are not Notarized which should not otherwise affect
functionality, (other than the ability to easily launch the browser on
macOS 10.15+ -- see quarantine note below). At this time, developers can
obtain a Hardened Runtime build with the
``com.apple.security.get-task-allow`` entitlement allowed by submitting
a try build and downloading the dmg generated by the "Rpk" shippable
build job. A debugger can be attached to Firefox processes of these
builds. try builds use the ``developer.entitlements.xml`` file from the
source tree while production builds use ``production.entitlements.xml``.
**On macOS 10.15+, downloaded try builds will not launch by default
because Notarization is required. To workaround this problem, remove the
quarantine extended attribute from the downloaded Nightly:**

  ``$ xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Path/to/Nightly.app``

Local Builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Local builds of mozilla-central do not enable Hardened Runtime and hence
do not have debugging restrictions. As a result, some functionality will
be permitted on local builds, but blocked on production builds which
have Hardened Runtime enabled. `Bug
1522409 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1522409>`__ was
filed to automate codesigning local builds to enable Hardened Runtime by
default and eliminate this discrepancy.

To obtain a Hardened Runtime build without using try infrastructure, a
developer can manually codesign builds using the macOS ``codesign(1)``
command with the ``developer.entitlements.xml`` file from the tree. This
requires creating a codesigning identity.

Disabling System Integrity Protection (SIP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If debugging a production build is required, follow Apple's documented
steps for disabling System Integrity Protection (SIP). Note that
disabling SIP bypasses Hardened Runtime restrictions which can mask some
bugs that only occur with Hardened Runtime so it is recommended to test
fixes with SIP enabled. **Disabling SIP has system security implications
that should be understood before taking this step.**

Creating an Xcode project
-------------------------

If you try to create a new Xcode project in an existing directory
then Xcode will delete its existing contents (Xcode will warn you
beforehand). To work around that, the steps below have you initialize
the project outside the Mozilla source tree, close the project, copy
the .xcodeproj project "file" into the source tree, and then reopen
the project to finish setting it up.

Note also that since Xcode 7.3.1 it doesn't seem to be possible to
have the Xcode project live outside the source tree. If you try to do
that then Xcode will simply **copy** the source files under the
project directory rather than link to them which breaks debugging and the
possibility to modify-rebuild-relaunch from inside Xcode.

These steps were last updated for Xcode 10.3:

#. Open Xcode, and create a new Project with File > New Project. Select
   the "Cross-platform" tab then under the "Other" template group select
   the "Empty" project type. the click Next. Name the project and click
   Next. Create/select a temporary directory to contain the project and
   then click Create.
#. Before going any further, close the project (File > Close Project)
   and open Finder. Find the \*.xcodejproj directory in the temporary
   directory, move it into your Mozilla source tree, and then
   double-click on it to reopen it.
#. In the left-hand pane in Xcode you should see a tree item where the
   root item has the project name. If the temporary directory that you
   originally created the Xcode project in is under that, right click it
   and delete it. Now, right click on the root item, select 'Add files
   to "<project-name>"', select all the files and directories in your
   source directory, untick "Copy items if needed", then click Add.
   (These will then be progressively added under the root item
   <project-name> in the left-hand pane. Note that subdirectories may
   initially appear to be empty, but they too will progressively be
   populated as Xcode processes the sourse files. Once done, you should
   be able to open any file quickly by hitting Cmd-Shift-O and typing in
   the name of a file.)
#. In the Product menu, select Scheme > New Scheme and name your scheme
   (for example, "Debug"). After you click OK, Xcode should open the
   settings window for the new scheme. (If not, then open its settings
   from the Product > Edit Scheme menu.)
#. Select "Run" on the left-hand side of the settings window, then
   select the "Info" tab. Set the Executable by clicking on "None" and
   selecting "Other...". A new dialog titled "Choose an executable to
   launch" will pop up. Browse to the ``.app`` file that you want to
   debug (``Firefox.app``, ``Nightly``\ ``Debug.app`` etc). The ``.app``
   file is typically found inside the ``dist`` folder in your build
   directory.
#. If you are debugging Firefox, Thunderbird, or some other application
   that supports multiple profiles, using a separate profile for
   debugging purposes is recommended. See "Having a profile for
   debugging purposes" below. Select the "Arguments" tab in the scheme
   editor, and click the '+' below the "Arguments passed on launch"
   field. Add "-P *profilename*", where *profilename* is the name of a
   profile you created previously. Repeat that to also add the argument
   "-no-remote".
#. Also in the "Arguments" panel, you may want to add an environment
   variable MOZ_DEBUG_CHILD_PROCESS set to the value 1 to help with
   debugging e10s.
#. Select "Build" from the left of the scheme editor window, and check
   that there is nothing listed under Targets (otherwise it may cause
   problems when you try to run the executable for debugging since you
   will get build errors).
#. Click "Close" to close the scheme editor.

At this point you can run the application from Xcode, and when you pause
or hit breakpoints it should show open the correct source file at the
correct line.

Setting up lldb
---------------

``lldb`` is the debugger Xcode provides/uses.

.. warning::

   One important issue that the Mozilla .lldbinit file fixes is that by
   default some breakpoints will be listed as "pending", and Xcode will
   not stop at them. If you don't include the Mozilla's .lldbinit, you
   must at least put
   ``settings set target.inline-breakpoint-strategy always`` in your
   ``$HOME/.lldbinit`` as recommended on :ref:`Debugging Firefox with
   lldb <Debugging Firefox with LLDB>`.

The
`.lldbinit <http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/.lldbinit>`__
file in the source tree imports many useful `Mozilla specific lldb
settings, commands and
formatters <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/python/lldbutils/README.txt>`__
into ``lldb``, but you may need to take one of the following steps to
make sure this file is used.

If you are using ``lldb`` on the command line (independently of Xcode)
and you will always run it from either the top source directory, the
object directory or else the dist/bin subdirectory of the object
directory, then adding the following setting to your ``$HOME/.lldbinit``
is sufficient:

::

   settings set target.load-cwd-lldbinit true

*However*, if you will run lldb from a different directory, or if you
will be running it indirectly by debugging in Xcode (Xcode always runs
lldb from "/"), then this setting will not help you. Instead, add the
following to your ``$HOME/.lldbinit``:

::

   # This automatically sources the Mozilla project's .lldbinit as soon as lldb
   # starts or attaches to a Mozilla app (that's in an object directory).
   #
   # This is mainly a workaround for Xcode not providing a way to specify that
   # lldb should be run from a given directory.  (Xcode always runs lldb from "/",
   # regardless of what directory Xcode was started from, and regardless of the
   # value of the "Custom working directory" field in the Scheme's Run options.
   # Therefore setting `settings set target.load-cwd-lldbinit true` can't help us
   # without Xcode providing that functionality.)
   #
   # The following works by setting a one-shot breakpoint to break on a function
   # that we know will both run early (which we want when we start first start the
   # app) and run frequently (which we want so that it will trigger ASAP if we
   # attach to an already running app).  The breakpoint runs some commands to
   # figure out the object directory path from the attached target and then
   # sources the .lldbinit from there.
   #
   # NOTE: This scripts actions take a few seconds to complete, so the custom
   # formatters, commands etc. that are added may not be immediately available.
   #
   breakpoint set --name nsThread::ProcessNextEvent --thread-index 1 --auto-continue true --one-shot true
   breakpoint command add -s python
       # This script that we run does not work if we try to use the global 'lldb'
       # object, since it is out of date at the time that the script runs (for
       # example, `lldb.target.executable.fullpath` is empty).  Therefore we must
       # get the following objects from the 'frame' object.
       target = frame.GetThread().GetProcess().GetTarget()
       debugger = target.GetDebugger()

       # Delete our breakpoint (not actually necessary with `--one-shot true`):
       target.BreakpointDelete(bp_loc.GetBreakpoint().GetID())

       # For completeness, find and delete the dummy breakpoint (the breakpoint
       # lldb creates when it can't initially find the method to set the
       # breakpoint on):
       # BUG WORKAROUND! GetID() on the *dummy* breakpoint appears to be returning
       # the breakpoint index instead of its ID.  We have to add 1 to correct for
       # that! :-(
       dummy_bp_list = lldb.SBBreakpointList(target)
       debugger.GetDummyTarget().FindBreakpointsByName("nsThread::ProcessNextEvent", dummy_bp_list)
       dummy_bp_id = dummy_bp_list.GetBreakpointAtIndex(0).GetID() + 1
       debugger.GetDummyTarget().BreakpointDelete(dummy_bp_id)

       # "source" the Mozilla project .lldbinit:
       os.chdir(target.executable.fullpath.split("/dist/")[0])
       debugger.HandleCommand("command source -s true " + os.path.join(os.getcwd(), ".lldbinit"))
   DONE

see :ref:`Debugging Mozilla with
lldb <Debugging Firefox with LLDB>`. for more information.

Having a profile for debugging purposes
---------------------------------------

It is recommended to create a separate profile to debug with, whatever
your task, so that you don't lose precious data like Bookmarks, saved
passwords, etc. So that you're not bothered with the profile manager
every time you start to debug, expand the "Executables" branch of the
"Groups & Files" list and double click on the Executable you added for
Mozilla. Click the plus icon under the "Arguments" list and type "-P
<profile name>" (e.g. "-P MozillaDebug"). Close the window when you're
done.

Running a debug session
-----------------------

Make sure breakpoints are active (which implies running under the
debugger) by opening the Product menu and selecting "Debug / Activate
Breakpoints" (also shown by the "Breakpoints" button in the top right
section of the main window). Then click the "Run" button or select "Run"
from the Product menu.

Setting breakpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting a breakpoint is easy. Just open the source file you want to
debug in Xcode, and click in the margin to the left of the line of code
where you want to break.

During the debugging session, each time that line is executed, the
debugger will break there, and you will be able to debug it.

.. warning::

   Note that with the default configuration, some breakpoints will be
   listed as "pending", and Xcode will not stop at them. If you don't
   include the Mozilla's .lldbinit, you must at least put
   ``settings set target.inline-breakpoint-strategy always`` in your
   ``$HOME/.lldbinit`` as recommended on :ref:`Debugging Mozilla with
   lldb <Debugging Firefox with LLDB>`.

Using Firefox-specific lldb commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you included the .lldbinit when `Setting up
lldb <#setting-up-lldb>`__, you can use Mozilla-specific lldb commands
in the console, located in the Debug area of Xcode. For example, type
``js`` to see the JavaScript stack. For more information, see :ref:`Debugging
Mozilla with lldb <Debugging Firefox with LLDB>`.

Debugging e10s child processes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using Xcode to debug child processes created by an e10s-enabled browser
is a little trickier than debugging a single-process browser, but it can
be done. These directions were written using Xcode 6.3.1

#. Complete all the steps above under "Creating the Project"
#. From the "Product" menu, ensure the scheme you created is selected
   under "Scheme", then choose "Scheme > Edit Scheme"
#. In the resulting popup, click "Duplicate Scheme"
#. Give the resulting scheme a more descriptive name than "Copy of
   Scheme"
#. Select "Run" on the left-hand side of the settings window, then
   select the "Info" tab. Set the Executable by clicking on the
   "Executable" drop-down, and selecting the ``plugin-container.app``
   that is inside the app bundle of the copy of Firefox you want to
   debug.
#. On the same tab, under "Launch" select "Wait for executable to be
   launched"
#. On the "Arguments" tab, remove all arguments passed on launch.

Now you're ready to start debugging:

#. From the "Product" menu, ensure the scheme you created above is
   selected under "Scheme"
#. Click the "Run" button. The information area at the top of the window
   will show "Waiting for plugin-container to launch"
#. From a command line, run your build of Firefox. When that launches a
   child process (for example, when you start to load a webpage), Xcode
   will notice and attach to that child process. You can then debug the
   child process like you would any other process.
#. When you are done debugging, click the "Stop" button and quit the
   instance of Firefox that you were debugging in the normal way.
