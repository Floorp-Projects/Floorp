Debugging On Windows
====================

+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

This document explains how to debug Gecko based applications such as
Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey on Windows using the Visual C++ IDE.

If VC++ and your Gecko application hang shortly after you launch the
application under the debugger, see `Problems Loading Debug
Symbols <#problems-loading-debug-symbols>`__.

Ways to start the debugger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First of all, it's necessary to install a Visual Studio extension to be
able to follow child processes as they are created. Firefox, in general,
and even in non-e10s mode, does not start the main process directly, it
starts it via a Launcher Process. This means that Visual Studio will
only attach to the first process it finds, and will not hit any
break-point (and even notifies you that it cannot find their location).
`Microsoft Child Process Debugging Power
Tool <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsdbgplat.MicrosoftChildProcessDebuggingPowerTool>`__
allows automatically attaching to child processes, such as Web Content
process, GPU process, etc. Enable it by going its configuration menu in
"Debug > Other debugging targets > Child process debugging settings",
and ticking the box.

If you have followed the steps in :ref:`Building Firefox for
Windows <Building Firefox On Windows>`
and have a local debug build, you can **execute this command from same command line.**

.. code::

   ./mach run --debug

It would open Visual Studio with Firefox's
run options configured. You can **click "Start" button** to run Firefox
then, already attached in the debugger.

Alternatively, if you have generated the Visual Studio solution, via
``./mach build-backend -b VisualStudio``, opening this solution allows
you to run ``firefox.exe`` directly in the debugger. Making it the
startup project, by right clicking on it (it appears bold when it's the
case) can be useful. Breakpoints are kept across runs, this can be a
good way to debug startup issues.

**Run the program until you hit an assertion.** You will get a dialog
box asking if you would like to debug. Hit "Cancel". The MSDEV IDE will
launch and load the file where the assertion happened. This will also
create a Visual C++ Mozilla project in the directory of the executable
by default.

**Attach the debugger to an existing Mozilla process**.  In the Visual
Studio, select Debug > Attach to Process. If you want to debug a content
process, you can **hover on the tab** of page you want to debug, which
would show the pid. You can then select the process from dialog opened
from "Attach to Process". For more information, see `Attach to Running
Processes with the Visual Studio
Debugger <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/3s68z0b3.aspx>`__.

**Starting an MSIX installed Firefox with the debugger**. In Visual
Studio, select Debug -> Other Debug Targets -> Debug Installed App Package.
In the dialog, select the installed Firefox package you wish to debug
and click "Start".

Debugging Release and Nightly Builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Refer to the steps to :ref:`use the Mozilla symbol
server <Using The Mozilla Symbol Server>` and :ref:`source
server <Using The Mozilla Source Server>`

Creating a Visual C++ project for Firefox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please refer to :ref:`this <Visual Studio Projects>`.

Changing/setting the executable to debug
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VC++ 6.0: To change or set the executable to debug, go to Project >
Settings..., Debug tab and select General from the drop down list.
"Executable for debug session:" should show the executable you are
debugging. If it is empty or incorrect, use the arrow button and select
Browse... to locate the executable.

Command line parameters and environment variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VC++ 6.0: To change or set the command line options, go to Project >
Settings..., Debug tab and select General from the drop down list.
"Program arguments:" should show the options.

Some common options would be the URL of the file you want the browser to
open as soon as it starts, starting the Profile Manager, or selecting a
profile. You can also redirect the console output to a file (by adding
"``> filename.txt``" for example, without the quotes).

In VC 7 and 8 this option is called Project > Properties > Debugging >
Command Arguments. VC 8 also allows you to set environment variables
there.

Setting breakpoints in DLLs which are not yet loaded in memory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VC++ 6.0: Go to Project > Settings..., Debug tab and select "Additional
DLLs" from the drop down list. Check "Locate Additional DLLs" option.
For each DLL, click the "New" button which creates a new entry and then
hit the "..." buttons which lets you browse to the DLL. You will only be
able to add one DLL at a time.

VC++ 7.0 automatically finds additional DLLs.

Customizing the debugger's variable value view
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can customize how Visual C++ displays classes in the variable view.
By default VC++ displays "{...}" and you need to click the small + icon
to expand the members. You can change this behaviour, and make Visual
C++ display whatever data member you want in whatever order, formatter
however you like instead of just "{...}".

You need to locate a file called "AUTOEXP.DAT" in your Visual C++
installation. By default it will be:

VC++ 6.0:

.. code::

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\MSDev98\Bin\AUTOEXP.DAT

VC++ 7.0:

.. code::

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Common7\Packages\Debugger\AUTOEXP.DAT

The file has information about the format in the beginning, and after a
little practice you should be well on your way. Here are some entries
that will make your life easier:

::

   ;; Mozilla (1.7beta and later)
   nsAutoString=<mData,su>
   nsString=<mData,su>
   nsCString=<mData,s>
   nsCAutoString=<mData,s>
   nsRect=x=<x,d> y=<y,d> width=<width,d>; height=<height,d>
   nsStaticAtomWrapper=<mStaticAtom->mString,s>
   nsIAtom=<mString,su>
   ; the following are not necessary in vc8
   nsCOMPtr<*>=<mRawPtr,x>
   nsRefPtr=<mRawPtr,x>
   nsAutoPtr=<mRawPtr,x>

After you have made the changes and saved the file, you will need to
restart Visual C++ for the changes to take effect.

For XPCOM Strings (the "external" string API) you can use the following
values:

::

   ;; Mozilla (1.9)
   ; Internal Strings
   nsAString_internal=<mData,su>, length=<mLength,u>
   nsACString_internal=<mData,s>, length=<mLength,u>
   ; XPCOM Strings
   nsAString=<nsStringContainer.v,su>, length=<nsStringContainer.d1,u>
   nsACString=<nsCStringContainer.v,s>, length=<nsCStringContainer.d1,u>
   nsStringContainer=<v,su>, length=<d1,u>
   nsCStringContainer=<v,s>, length=<d1,u>

There is a more extensive version of this file in progress in
`AutoExpForVC8. <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Debugging/AutoExpForVC8>`__

Avoiding stepping into certain functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can avoid stepping into certain functions, such as nsCOMPtr methods,
using an undocumented feature of VC. See the blog post `How to Not Step
Into Functions using the Visual C++
Debugger <http://blogs.msdn.com/andypennell/archive/2004/02/06/69004.aspx>`__
for details.

Here are some wildcards you can use (tested with VC 8):

.. code::

   nsCOMPtr.*\:\:.*=NoStepInto
   (nsG|g)etter_*AddRefs.*=NoStepInto
   NS_ConvertUTF.*
   ; Might be too broad:
   (ns|Promise)[^\:]*[sS]tring.*
   ...add common functions to this list

should probably make a .reg file for easy importing

Obtaining ``stdout`` and other ``FILE`` handles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running the following command in the Command Window in Visual Studio
returns the value of ``stdout``, which can be used with various
debugging methods (such as ``nsGenericElement::List``) that take a
``FILE*`` param:

.. code::

   Debug.EvaluateStatement {,,msvcr80d}(&__iob_func()[1])

(Alternatively you can evaluate ``{,,msvcr80d}(&__iob_func()[1])`` in
the QuickWatch window)

Similarly, you can open a file on the disk using ``fopen``:

.. code::

   >Debug.EvaluateStatement {,,msvcr80d}fopen("c:\\123", "w")
   0x10311dc0 { ..snip.. }
   >Debug.EvaluateStatement ((nsGenericElement*)0x03f0e710)->List((FILE*)0x10311dc0, 1)
   <void>
   >Debug.EvaluateStatement {,,msvcr80d}fclose((FILE*)0x10311dc0)
   0x00000000

Note that you may not see the debugging output until you flush or close
the file handle.

Disabling ASSERTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are basically two ways to disable assertions. One requires setting
an environment variable, while the other affects only the currently
running program instance in memory.

Environment variable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is an environment variable that can disable breaking for
assertions. This is how you would normally set it:

.. code::

   set XPCOM_DEBUG_BREAK=warn

The environment variable takes also other values besides ``warn``, see
``XPCOM_DEBUG_BREAK`` for more details.

Note that unlike Unix, the default for Windows is not warn, it's to pop
up a dialog. To set the environment variable for Visual Studio, use
Project > Properties > Debugging > Environment and click the little box.
Then use

.. code::

   XPCOM_DEBUG_BREAK=warn

Changing running code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You normally shouldn't need to do this (just quit the application, set
the environment variable described above, and run it again). And this
can be **dangerous** (like **trashing your hard disc and corrupting your
system**). So unless you feel comfortable with this, don't do it. **You
have been warned!**

It is possible to change the interrupt code in memory (which causes you
to break into debugger) to be a NOP (no operation).

You do this by running the program in the debugger until you hit an
assertion. You should see some assembly code. One assembly code
instruction reads "int 3". Check the memory address for that line. Now
open memory view. Type/copy/drag the memory address of "int 3" into the
memory view to get it to update on that part of the memory. Change the
value of the memory to "90", close the memory view and hit "F5" to
continue.

| Confused? See the screenshot below:
| |Screenshot of disabling assertions|

VC++ 7.0?

Automatically handling ASSERTIONS without a debugger attached
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When an assertion happens and there is not a debugger attached, a small
helper application
(```windbgdlg.exe`` </En/Automatically_Handle_Failed_Asserts_in_Debug_Builds>`__)
is run. That application can automatically select a response to the "Do
you want to debug" dialog instead of prompting if you configure it, for
more info, see
```windbgdlg.exe`` </En/Automatically_Handle_Failed_Asserts_in_Debug_Builds>`__.

Debugging optimized builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To effectively debug optimized builds, you should enable debugging
information which effectively leaves the debug symbols in optimized code
so you can still set breakpoints etc. Because the code is optimized,
stepping through the code may occasionally provide small surprises when
the debugger jumps over something.

You need to make sure this configure parameter is set:

.. code::

   --enable-debugger-info-modules=yes

You can also choose to include or exclude specific modules. This is
particularly useful to avoid linking layout with debugging information.

Console debugging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When printing to STDOUT from a content process, the console message will
not appear on Windows. One way to view it is simply to disable e10s
(``./mach run --disable-e10s``) but in order to debug with e10s enabled
one can run

::

   ./mach run ... 2>&1 | tee

It may also be necessary to disable the content sandbox
(``MOZ_DISABLE_CONTENT_SANDBOX=1 ./mach run ...``).

Running two instances of Mozilla simultaneously
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run two instances of Mozilla (e.g. debug and optimized)
simultaneously by setting the environment variable ``MOZ_NO_REMOTE``:

.. code::

   set MOZ_NO_REMOTE=1

Or, starting with Firefox 2 and other Gecko 1.8.1-based applications,
you can use the ``-no-remote`` command-line switch instead (implemented
in
`bug 325509 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=325509>`__).

You can also specify the profile to use with the ``-P profile_name``
command-line argument.

Debugging JavaScript
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use `Venkman <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/Mozilla/Venkman>`__, the JavaScript Debugger for Mozilla.

You can use helper functions from
`nsXPConnect.cpp <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/js/xpconnect/src/nsXPConnect.cpp>`__
to inspect and modify the state of JavaScript code from the MSVS
debugger.

For example, to print current JavaScript stack to stdout, evaluate this
in QuickWatch window:

.. code::

   {,,xul}DumpJSStack()

Visual C++ will show you something in the quick watch window, but
not the stack, you have to look in the OS console for the output.

Also this magical command only works when the VC++ stack is in certain
states. It works when you have js_Interpret() in the newest stackframe

Debugging minidumps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See :ref:`debugging a minidump <Debugging A Minidump>`.

Debugging treeherder builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See `Running Windows Debug Builds <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/Mozilla/Running_Windows_Debug_Builds>`__

Problems Loading Debug Symbols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If both your application and Visual C++ hang shortly after launching the
application under the debugger, you may be hitting a known deadlock in
the way Visual Studio downloads debug symbols for the system libraries;
see
https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/422970/hang-loading-rasapi32-pdb-when-using-symbol-server.

There are two ways to work around this problem:

#. Turn off automatic symbol downloading for system libraries: in Tools
   > Options > Debugging > Symbols, uncheck the Microsoft symbol server.
#. Pre-load all the Windows debug symbols. These instructions apply to
   Visual Studio 10 on Windows 7; other software versions likely need to
   have file paths adjusted.

   #. Locate the Microsoft utility "SymChk.exe" on your system (it will
      likely be in the installation directory of your Windows Debugging
      Tools).

   #. Find the directory where Visual Studio caches downloaded symbols;
      in VC++ 10 open the menu to Tools > Options > Debugging  > Symbols
      and copy the field "Cache symbols in this directory".

   #. In a command window, run

      ::

         symchk.exe /r C:\windows\SysWOW64\ /s "SRV*<your cache symbols directory>\MicrosoftPublicSymbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols"

      | 
      | Note the "``\MicrosoftPublicSymbols``" appended to the cache
        directory configured in Visual Studio.

Downloading all symbols can take a long time; you can replace
C:\windows\SysWOW64\\ with the name of a single .DLL to download symbols
only for the specific libraries you are trying to debug. Unfortunately,
it's hard to know which symbols to download without having VS hang and
seeing the "Downloading symbols for <library>" status at the bottom left
of the main window.

Problems post-mortem debugging on Windows 7 SP1 x64?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you attempt to use ``NS_DebugBreak`` etc to perform post-mortem
debugging on a 64bit Windows 7, but as soon as you try and continue
debugging the program crashes with an Access Violation, you may be
hitting a Windows bug relating to AVX support.  For more details,
including a work-around see `this blog
post <http://www.os2museum.com/wp/?p=960>`__ or `this social.msdn
thread <http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/392ca62c-e502-42d9-adbc-b4e22d5da0c3/jit-debugging-32bit-app-crashing-with-access-violation>`__. 
(And just in-case those links die, the work-around is to execute

::

   bcdedit /set xsavedisable 1

from an elevated command-prompt to disable AVX support.)
