Levelling up
============

Once you’ve fixed a few bugs, it’s quite likely that we’ll ask you to
complete one or more of the following steps. They will grant you access
to useful Mozilla infrastructure for testing or landing code
automatically, so you can be more autonomous and able to contribute with
less supervision.

If you’re curious, the `Mozilla Commit Access
Policy <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/commit/access-policy/>`__
page explains what does each level mean.

Request commit access level 1
-----------------------------

Once this is granted, you can use the
`Try server <https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/TryServer>`__ for
running automated tests of your code.

To request this, follow the instructions on the `Becoming A Mozilla Committer <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/commit/>`__ page
to file a bug with the title “Commit Access (Level 1) for ${your name}”,
and continue with steps such as adding the public SSH key, etc (it’s not
enough with just filing the bug!).

The person that asked you to request this can also vouch for you.

Request commit access level 3
-----------------------------

After you landed a few bugs, that are more advanced than the
``good-first-bugs`` and you feel confident about your contributions as
well as the process, you can request level 3 access. Once this is
granted, you will get access to Lando, the autoland feature.

To request this, follow the instructions on the `Becoming A Mozilla Committer <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/commit/>`__ page
to file a bug with the title “Commit Access (Level 3) for ${your name}”.

The person that asked you to request this can also vouch for you, and at
this point you might already know a few other people who will vouch for
you. You need two vouchers.

If you reach this level, well done! That’s amazing, and we’re glad to
have you on board 😄
