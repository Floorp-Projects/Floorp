Welcome to the Firefox codebase!
--------------------------------

This page is here to help you get from "I want to build Firefox"
to "I'm building my own Firefox" to "I can contribute to Firefox". 
So if you'd like to help Mozilla build the best web browser in the
world, you're in the right place.

The Mozilla community prides itself on being an open, accessible, and
friendly community for new participants. If you have any difficulties
getting involved or finding answers to your questions, please `come and
ask your questions in our
chatroom <https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#introduction:mozilla.org>`,
where we can help you get started.

We know even before you start contributing that getting set up to work
on Firefox and finding a bug that's a good fit for your skills can be a
challenge, and we're always looking for ways to improve this process: making
Mozilla more open, accessible, and easier to participate with. If you're
having any trouble following this documentation, or hit a barrier you
can't get around, please join us in the the Introduction room on Matrix
or contact Mike Hoye directly at mhoye@mozilla.com.

How To Get Started: Setting Up To Build Firefox
-----------------------------------------------

If you'd like to contribute to Firefox, your first step will be to get
set up for your platform. This will be straightforward, but may take some
time; there are some big downloads and long compiles involved, so you may want to move
on to the next steps while it builds. 

Firefox is big, and there are a lot of moving parts to it; if you're starting from
scratch, you're going to need about forty gigabytes of free disk space and reliable
internet connection to pull in everything you need. For more information, click Next!
