Firefox Source Code Directory Structure
=======================================

This article provides an overview of what the various directories contain.

To simply take a look at the Firefox source code, you do not need to
download it. You can look at the source directly with your web browser
using Searchfox (start at https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source for
the complete firefox source code of branch HEAD).

In order to modify the source, you have to acquire it either by
downloading a
`snapshot <https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Source_Code/Downloading_Source_Archives>`__
of the sources or by checking out the current sources from :ref:`Mercurial <Firefox Contributors' Quick Reference>`.

This document describes the directory structure -- i.e., directories that
are used by at least some of the
Mozilla project's client products. There are other directories in the
other Mozilla repository, such as those for Web tools and those for the
Classic codebase.

See `source code directories
overview <https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Archive/Misc_top_level/Source_code_directories_overview>`__ for a
somewhat different (older) version of the same information. Also see the
`more detailed overview of the pieces of
