Pocket Guide: Shipping Firefox
==============================

*Estimated read time:* 15min


Introduction
------------

The purpose of this document is to provide a high level understanding of
how Mozilla ships Firefox. With the intention of helping new Mozillians
(and those who would like a refresher) understand the basics of our
release process, tools, common terms, and mechanisms employed in
shipping Firefox to our users. Often this document will introduce a
concept, explain how it fits into the process, and then provide a link
to learn more if interested.

.. note::

  This does not contain an overview of how we
  ship :ref:`Fenix <fenix>` (Our next gen Android browser) as
  that product is largely uncoupled from how we ship to desktop and the
  process we've historically followed.

Repositories & Channels
-----------------------

Shipping Firefox follows a software release :ref:`train model <train model>` along 3 primary code
:ref:`repositories <repositories>`; mozilla-central (aka “m-c”),
mozilla-beta, and mozilla-release. Each of these repositories are
updated within a defined cadence and built into one of our Firefox
products which are released through what is commonly referred to as
:ref:`Channels <channels>`: Firefox Nightly, Firefox Beta, and Firefox
Release.

**Firefox Nightly** offers access to the latest cutting edge features
still under active development. Released every 12 hours with all the
changes that have :ref:`landed <landing>` on mozilla-central.

Every `4 weeks <https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar>`__, we
:ref:`merge <merge>` the code from mozilla-central to our
mozilla-beta branch. New code or Features can be added to mozilla-beta
outside of this 4 week cadence but will be required to land in
mozilla-central and then be :ref:`uplift <uplift>`\ed into
mozilla-beta.

**Firefox Beta** is for developers and early adopters who want to see
and test what’s coming next in Firefox. We release a new Beta version
three times a week.

.. note::

  The first and second beta builds of a new cycle are shipped to a
  subset of our Beta population. The full Beta population gets updated
  starting with Beta 3 only.*

Each Beta cycle lasts a total of 4 weeks where a final build is
validated by our QA and tagged for release into the mozilla-release
branch.

.. note::

  **Firefox Developer Edition** *is a separate product based on
  the mozilla-beta repo and is specifically tailored for Web Developers.*

**Firefox Release** is released every 4 weeks and is the final product
of our Beta cycle. As our primary product shipping to hundreds of
millions of users, interim updates and
:ref:`ride-alongs <ride alongs>` are only shipped to Release if
they contain :ref:`dot release drivers <dot release drivers>`.

.. note::
  **Firefox ESR (Extended Support Release)** *is a separate
  product intended for Enterprise use. Major updates are rolled out 1-2
  times per year to maintain stability and predictability. ESR also
  contains a number of policy options not available in the standard
  Firefox Release. Minor updates are shipped in sync with the Firefox
  Release schedule for security and stability fixes only.*

Landing Code and Shipping Features
----------------------------------

Mozillians (those employed by MoCo and the broader community) land lots
of code in the Mozilla repositories: fixes, enhancements, compatibility,
new features, etc. and is managed by :ref:`Mercurial <Mercurial Overview>` (aka
hg). All new code is tracked in :ref:`Bugzilla <bugzilla>`, reviewed
in :ref:`Phabricator <Phabricator>`, and then checked into the
mozilla-central repository using :ref:`Lando <Lando>`.

.. note::

  Some teams use `GitHub <github>` during development
  but will still be required to use Phabricator (tracked in Bugzilla) to
  check their code into the mozilla-central hg repository.

The standard process for code to be delivered to our users is by ‘riding
the trains’, meaning that it’s landed in mozilla-central where it waits
for the next Beta cycle to begin. After merging to Beta the code will
stabilize over a 4 week period (along with everything else that merged
from mozilla-central). At the end of the beta cycle a release candidate
(:ref:`RC <rc>`) build will be generated, tested thoroughly, and
eventually become the next version of Firefox.

-  `Firefox Trello <https://trello.com/b/8k1hT2vh/firefox>`__ (Distilled
   list of critical features riding the trains)

An exception to this process...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not all code can simply wait for the normal train model to be included
in a Firefox build. There are a variety of reasons for this; critical
fixes, security concerns, stabilizing a feature that’s already in Beta,
shipping high priority features faster, and so on.

In these situations an uplift can be requested to take a recent landing
in mozilla-central and merge specific bits to another repository outside
the standard train model. After the request is made within Bugzilla,
`Release Management <release management>` will assess the potential risk
and will make a decision on whether it’s accepted.

   rules <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Uplift_rules>`__

Ensuring build stability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Throughout the process of landing code in mozilla-central to riding the
trains to Firefox Release, there are many milestones and quality
checkpoints from a variety of teams. This process is designed to ensure
a quality and compelling product will be consistently delivered to our
users with each new version. See below for a distilled list of those
milestones.

========================================= ========== =============== ===============================================================================


The Release Management team (aka “Relman”) monitors and enforces this
process to protect the stability of Firefox. Each member of Relman
rotates through end-to-end ownership of a given :ref:`release
cycle <release cycle>`. The Relman owner of a cycle will focus on the
overall release, blocker bugs, risks, backout rates, stability/crash
reports, etc. Go here for a complete overview of the `Relman Release
Process
Checklist <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Release_Process_Checklist_Documentation>`__.

.. note::

  While Relman will continually monitor the overall health of each
  Release it is the responsibility of the engineering organization to
  ensure the code they are landing is of high quality and the potential
  risks are understood. Every Release has an assigned :ref:`Regression
  Engineering Owner <reo>` (REO) to ensure a decision is made
  about each regression reported in the release.*

   Channels <https://pascalc.net/rm_queries/>`__

Enabling/Disabling code (Prefs)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Within Firefox we allow the ability to Enable/Disable bits of code or
entire features using `Preferences <preferences>`. There are many
reasons why this is useful. Here are some examples:

-  Continual development over multiple release cycles without exposing
   partially completed features to our users
-  Provide the ability to quickly disable a feature if there is a
   problem found during the release process
-  Control features which are experimental or not ready to be shown to a
   specific channel population (e.g. enabled for Beta but disabled for
   Release)
-  A/B testing via :ref:`telemetry <telemetry>` experiments

.. note::

  :ref:`Normandy <normandy>` Pref Rollout is a feature that
  allows Mozilla to change the state of a preference for a targeted set of
  users, without deploying an update to Firefox. This is especially useful
  when conducting experiments or a gradual rollout of high risk features
  to our Release population.

Release & Feature QA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Release QA is performed regularly and throughout the Release Cycle.
Organized in two-week sprints its primary goals are:

-  Qualifying builds for release
-  Feature testing
-  Product Integrity requests
-  Bug work
-  Community engagement

Features that can have significant impact and/or pose risk to the code
base should be nominated for QA support by the :ref:`feature
owner <feature owner>` in its intended release. This process is kicked
off by filing a :ref:`Product Integrity <product integrity>` team request
:ref:`PI request <pi request>`. These are due by the end of week 2
of the Nightly cycle.

.. note::

  Manual QA testing is only required for features as they go
  through the Beta cycle. Nightly Feature testing is always optional.

Experiments
~~~~~~~~~~~

As we deliver new features to our users we continually ask ourselves
about the potential impacts, both positive and negative. In many new
features we will run an experiment to gather data around these impacts.
A simple definition of an experiment is a way to measure how a change to
our product affects how people use it.

An experiment has three parts:

1. A new feature that can be selectively enabled
2. A group of users to test the new feature
3. Telemetry to measure how people interact with the new feature

Experiments are managed by an in-house tool called
`Experimenter <https://experimenter.services.mozilla.com/>`__.
