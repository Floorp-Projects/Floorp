# Rust Update Policy

We document here the decision making and planning around when we update the
Rust toolchains used and required to build Firefox.

This allows contributors to know when new features will be usable, and
downstream packagers to know what toolchain will be required for each Firefox
release. Both benefit from the predictability of a schedule.

## Policy

### Official builds

_We ship official stable Firefox with a stable Rust._

As a general rule, we update the Rust version used to build Firefox Nightly
soon after its release, unless it's less than 7 days away from a soft-freeze,
in which case we wait for the next Nightly train.

We don't upgrade the Rust version in the beta or release branches of Firefox.

The following exceptions apply:

- We may use a Rust version from the Rust beta or nightly channels for new
  platforms (e.g. we did so for Android, arm64 Windows and arm64 macOS), and
  later upgrade when that Rust version becomes stable (we may even do so on the
  Firefox beta branch).

- We may skip the update (or backout the update) if major problems are
  encountered (typically, we've had to do so because of build problems, crash
  reporting bustage, or performance issues).

### Developer builds

_Local developer builds use whatever Rust toolchain is available on the
system._

Someone building Firefox can maintain the latest stable Rust with the `rustup`
or `mach bootstrap` tools, or try other variations.

### Minimum Supported Rust Version

_We will update the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) when required._

The MSRV will generally remain unchanged, until a newer version is required
by some code.

When that happens, we'll prefer to update the MSRV to the strict minimum
required at that moment (e.g. if we require version 1.47.0, the currently used
Rust version is 1.51.0, and a crate needs 1.50.0, we'll prefer to update the
MSRV to 1.50.0 rather than 1.51.0).

The MSRV won't be updated to a version of Rust that hasn't been used for
Firefox Nightly for at least 14 days.

We expect ESR releases will keep their MSRV, so backporting security fixes may
require Rust compatibility work.

### Rationale

Historically, the Rust ecosystem quickly required new features provided by new
Rust compilers, which made it necessary to update the minimum supported version
quite often, and as such, a scheduled update was deemed a better trade-off.

Fast-forward several years, and new Rust compiler releases more rarely sport
ground-breaking new features, which has reduced the necessity to update quite
significantly.

On the flip side, in some instances, we have had to stick to specific versions
of the Rust compiler for extended periods of time because of e.g. regressions,
going against the schedule.

## Schedule

Here are the Rust versions for each Firefox version.

- The "Uses" column indicates the version of Rust used to build
  releases shipped to users.

- The "MSRV" column indicates the minimum supported Rust version to build
  the sources.
