# Rust Update Policy

We document here the decision making and planning around when we update the
Rust toolchains used and required to build Firefox.

This allows contributors to know when new features will be usable, and
downstream packagers to know what toolchain will be required for each Firefox
release. Both benefit from the predictability of a schedule.

## Policy

### Official builds

_We ship official stable Firefox with stable Rust._

Typically we build Firefox Nightly with the current stable Rust and let that
configuration ride through beta to release. There have been frequent exceptions
where we've adopted a beta Rust during the Nightly phase to address some
platform support issue, and later updated when that Rust version became stable.
For example, we needed to use beta Rust for our own builds when we first added
Rust support to Firefox for Android.

The policy provides good stability guarantees once Firefox is in release, while
giving us the freedom to respond to the issues experience shows we'll need to
address during development.

###  Developer builds

_Local developer builds use whatever Rust toolchain is available on the
system._

Someone building Firefox can maintain the latest stable Rust with the `rustup`
for `mach bootstrap` tools, or try other variations.

### Required versions

_We require a new stable Rust starting 2 weeks after it is released._

This policy effectively removes the difference between the required Rust
version and the default target for official builds, while still giving tier-3
developers some time to process toolchain updates.

Downstream packagers still have 2-3 months to package each stable Rust release
before it’s required by a new Firefox release.

The stable+two weeks requirement is a rough target. We expect to hit it within
a few days for most Rust releases. But, for example, when the target date falls
within a mozilla-central soft freeze (before branching for a beta release) we
may update a week later.

We expect esr releases will stay on the same minimum Rust version, so
backporting security fixes may require Rust compatibility work too.

### Rationale

We need to be fast and efficient across the whole system which includes the
Rust, Servo, and Firefox development teams. We realise that the decisions we
make have an impact downstream, and we want to minimise the negative aspects of
that impact. However, we cannot do so at the expense of our own productivity.

There are many other stakeholders, of course, but our work in Gecko and Servo
are major drivers for Rust language, compiler, and library development. That
influence is more effective if we can iterate quickly. Servo itself often uses
experimental language features to give the necessary early feedback on features
as they evolve.

Rust updates every six weeks, just like Firefox. This is more like web
languages than native languages, but it's been great for building community. We
(as Gecko developers) should embrace it.

Many of us think of the toolchain and source code as being conceptually
different. At this point in time, Rust is evolving much more quickly than
Python or C++. For now it is easier to think of Rust as being part of Firefox,
rather than thinking of it like a C++ toolchain with decades of history which
we we have little influence on.

Official build configurations are generally part of the Firefox code itself,
subject to normal review, and don't affect anyone else. Therefore it's
straightforward to manage the Rust toolchain we use directly like any other
change.

For contributors, we maintain a minimum supported Rust toolchain This helps
those working on tier-3 platforms, where updating Rust can be more difficult
than just running `rustup update`, by giving them time to adapt. However, it
means other contributors must backport newer work to maintain compatibility. As
more Rust code was merged into Firefox this became expensive.

Historically we bumped this minimum every 3-4 Rust releases, which also helped
contributors on slow network connections since they didn't have to download
toolchains as often. Deciding to bump this way involved negotiating each
change, which by late 2017 many contributors felt was a more significant
burden. Delaying to give tier-3 platforms months instead of weeks to update
their Rust packages is also not considered a good trade-off.

My experience is that it takes about a week for version bumps to start pulling
in dependent crates using new language features, so updating after a couple of
weeks acts as only a moderate restraint on Servo developers working on Gecko
modules. I think this is the correct trade-off between those two groups.

### Alternate Proposals

_We require nightly Rust_

This would certainly speed up the feedback with language design. However, we
would frequently encounter build breakage when unstable language features
change. Even Servo pins to a specific nightly to avoid this problem. That’s
appropriate for a smaller research project, but not something the size of
Firefox.

We should and do test building Firefox with nightly Rust to catch compiler
issues, but that’s different from requiring everyone to use unstable Rust.

_We require beta Rust_

I don’t think anyone has suggested this, but I thought I’d include it for
completeness. This shortens the feedback cycle for new features at the expense
of more churn for contributors. It’s not a good trade-off because by the time a
new feature is stabilized in beta Rust, it’s too late to change it much. This
is better served by particular developers working with upstream directly. I
believe beta is also something of an “excluded middle” in the Rust ecosystem,
with most contributors working with either stable or unstable nightly Rust.

_We require the previous stable Rust once a new stable Rust is released._

That is, we bump the Firefox minimum to Rust 1.n.m when rust 1.(n+1).0 stable
is released. This is roughly every 6 weeks, with six weeks to update before
bumping into the new requirement. This policy might be simpler for contributors
to remember. There's not much difference in the amount of time downstream
packager receive for a particular Firefox release. This is a trade-off of more
time for tier-3 developers against people working on Gecko/Servo components
doing extra work to maintain compatibility. As I say above, I think this is the
wrong choice.

_We bump the minimum Rust version only when new features are compelling._

This reduces churn for developers, but the need to negotiate each bump takes
time better spent on development. See the motivation section above.
