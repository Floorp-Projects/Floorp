L10n
====

The l10n linter checks for mistakes and problems in the localizable files.
Most of the code lives inside the
`compare-locales <https://pypi.org/project/compare-locales/>`_
package, and is shipping as the ``moz-l10n-lint`` command.

The linter checks for fundamental issues like parsing errors, but it also
finds more subtle mistakes like duplicated messages. It also warns if you're
trying to change a string without changing the ID, or to add a string that's
still in use in a stable channel with a different value.

The warnings on string ID changes get reported on phabricator, but they're
not making the build fail. To find out when to change IDs and when not to,
read the :ref:`Lifecycle & Workflow <Localization>` section in the
localization documentation.

Run Locally
-----------

The can be run using mach:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ mach lint --linter l10n <file paths>

Alternatively, omit the ``--linter l10n`` and run all configured linters, which
will include the l10n linter.


Updating the Reference
----------------------

The linter checks out the cross-channel localization files into your
``.mozbuild`` state directory. By default this is updated automatically after
48 hours. There might be new strings anyway, if you want to ensure an
updated clone, remove the marker file in
``~/.mozbuild/gecko-strings/.hg/l10n_pull_marker``.
