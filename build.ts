üèóÔ∏è  Noraneko Build System

Usage:
  deno run -A build.ts [option]

Development (recommended):
  --dev                       Full development build with browser launch
  (no args)                   Same as --dev

Production CI/CD Phases:
  --production-before         Production build - before phase (noraneko„Çπ„ÇØ„É™„Éó„ÉàÂÆüË°å)
  --production-after          Production build - after phase (InjectÂá¶ÁêÜ)
  --release-build-before      CI/CD production build - before phase
  --release-build-after       CI/CD production build - after phase

Development Split Phases (if needed):
  --dev-before                Development build - before phase
  --dev-after                 Development build - after phase with browser launch

Utilities:
  --write-version             Write version info only

Typical Workflows:

Development:
  deno task dev               # Full build + launch browser

Production (CI/CD):
  1. deno task prod-before    # Run noraneko scripts  
  2. ./mach build             # External Mozilla build
  3. deno task prod-after     # Run inject processes

Examples:
  deno run -A build.ts
  deno run -A build.ts --dev
  deno task dev
      `);
      break;
    }
  }
} else {
  // Default to development build with browser launch
  await buildAndLaunch({ mode: "dev", launchBrowser: true });
}
