/**
 * Helper interface for allowing scripts to treat nsIArray instances as if
 * they were nsISupportsArray instances while iterating.
 *
 * nsISupportsArray is convenient to iterate over in JavaScript:
 *
 * for (let i = 0; i < array.Count(); ++i) {
 *   let elem = array.GetElementAt(i);
 *   ...
 * }
 *
 * but doing the same with nsIArray is somewhat less convenient, since
 * queryElementAt is not nearly so nice to use from JavaScript.  So we provide
 * this extension interface so interfaces that currently return
 * nsISupportsArray can start returning nsIArrayExtensions and all JavaScript
 * should Just Work. Eventually we'll roll this interface into nsIArray
 * itself, possibly getting rid of the Count() method, as it duplicates
 * nsIArray functionality.
