  // Inter-process memory reporting proceeds as follows.
  //
  // - GetReports() (declared within NS_DECL_NSIMEMORYREPORTERMANAGER)
  //   synchronously gets memory reports for the current process, sets up some
  //   state (mPendingProcessesState) for when child processes report back --
  //   including a timer -- and starts telling child processes to get memory
  //   reports.  Control then returns to the main event loop.
  //
  //   The number of concurrent child process reports is limited by the pref
  //   "memory.report_concurrency" in order to prevent the memory overhead of
  //   memory reporting from causing problems, especially on B2G when swapping
  //   to compressed RAM; see bug 1154053.
  //
  // - HandleChildReport() is called (asynchronously) once per child process
  //   reporter callback.
  //
  // - EndProcessReport() is called (asynchronously) once per process that
  //   finishes reporting back, including the parent.  If all processes do so
  //   before time-out, the timer is cancelled.  If there are child processes
  //   whose requests have not yet been sent, they will be started until the
  //   concurrency limit is (again) reached.
  //
  // - TimeoutCallback() is called (asynchronously) if all the child processes
  //   don't respond within the time threshold.
  //
  // - FinishReporting() finishes things off.  It is *always* called -- either
  //   from EndChildReport() (if all child processes have reported back) or
  //   from TimeoutCallback() (if time-out occurs).
  //
  // All operations occur on the main thread.
  //
  // The above sequence of steps is a "request".  A partially-completed request
  // is described as "in flight".
  //
  // Each request has a "generation", a unique number that identifies it.  This
  // is used to ensure that each reports from a child process corresponds to
  // the appropriate request from the parent process.  (It's easier to
  // implement a generation system than to implement a child report request
  // cancellation mechanism.)
  //
  // Failures are mostly ignored, because it's (a) typically the most sensible
  // thing to do, and (b) often hard to do anything else.  The following are
  // the failure cases of note.
  //
  // - If a request is made while the previous request is in flight, the new
  //   request is ignored, as per getReports()'s specification.  No error is
  //   reported, because the previous request will complete soon enough.
  //
  // - If one or more child processes fail to respond within the time limit,
  //   things will proceed as if they don't exist.  No error is reported,
  //   because partial information is better than nothing.
  //
  // - If a child process reports after the time-out occurs, it is ignored.
  //   (Generation checking will ensure it is ignored even if a subsequent
  //   request is in flight;  this is the main use of generations.)  No error
  //   is reported, because there's nothing sensible to be done about it at
  //   this late stage.
  //
  // - If the time-out occurs after a child process has sent some reports but
  //   before it has signaled completion (see bug 1151597), then what it
  //   successfully sent will be included, with no explicit indication that it
  //   is incomplete.
  //
  // Now, what what happens if a child process is created/destroyed in the
  // middle of a request?  Well, PendingProcessesState is initialized with an
  // array of child process actors as of when the report started.  So...
  //
  // - If a process is created after reporting starts, it won't be sent a
  //   request for reports.  So the reported data will reflect how things were
  //   when the request began.
  //
  // - If a process is destroyed before it starts reporting back, the reported
  //   data will reflect how things are when the request ends.
  //
  // - If a process is destroyed after it starts reporting back but before it
  //   finishes, the reported data will contain a partial report for it.
  //
  // - If a process is destroyed after reporting back, but before all other
  //   child processes have reported back, it will be included in the reported
  //   data.  So the reported data will reflect how things were when the
  //   request began.
  //
  // The inconsistencies between these cases are unfortunate but difficult to
  // avoid.  It's enough of an edge case to not be worth doing more.
