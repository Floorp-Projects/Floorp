/**
 * The nsIInterfaceRequestor interface defines a generic interface for
 * requesting interfaces that a given object might provide access to.
 * This is very similar to QueryInterface found in nsISupports.
 * The main difference is that interfaces returned from GetInterface()
 * are not required to provide a way back to the object implementing this
 * interface.  The semantics of QI() dictate that given an interface A that
 * you QI() on to get to interface B, you must be able to QI on B to get back
 * to A.  This interface however allows you to obtain an interface C from A
 * that may or most likely will not have the ability to get back to A.
