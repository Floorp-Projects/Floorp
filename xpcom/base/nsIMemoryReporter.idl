interface nsIMemoryReporterCallback : nsISupports
{
  /*
   * The arguments to the callback are as follows.
   *
   *
   * |process|  The name of the process containing this reporter.  Each
   * reporter initially has "" in this field, indicating that it applies to the
   * current process.  (This is true even for reporters in a child process.)
   * When a reporter from a child process is copied into the main process, the
   * copy has its 'process' field set appropriately.
   *
   *
   * |path|  The path that this memory usage should be reported under.  Paths
   * are '/'-delimited, eg. "a/b/c".
   *
   * Each reporter can be viewed as representing a leaf node in a tree.
   * Internal nodes of the tree don't have reporters.  So, for example, the
   * reporters "explicit/a/b", "explicit/a/c", "explicit/d/e", and
   * "explicit/d/f" define this tree:
   *
   *   explicit
   *   |--a
   *   |  |--b [*]
   *   |  \--c [*]
   *   \--d
   *      |--e [*]
   *      \--f [*]
   *
   * Nodes marked with a [*] have a reporter.  Notice that the internal
   * nodes are implicitly defined by the paths.
   *
   * Nodes within a tree should not overlap measurements, otherwise the
   * parent node measurements will be double-counted.  So in the example
   * above, |b| should not count any allocations counted by |c|, and vice
   * versa.
   *
   * All nodes within each tree must have the same units.
   *
   * If you want to include a '/' not as a path separator, e.g. because the
   * path contains a URL, you need to convert each '/' in the URL to a '\'.
   * Consumers of the path will undo this change.  Any other '\' character
   * in a path will also be changed.  This is clumsy but hasn't caused any
   * problems so far.
   *
   * The paths of all reporters form a set of trees.  Trees can be
   * "degenerate", i.e. contain a single entry with no '/'.
   *
   *
   * |kind|  There are three kinds of memory reporters.
   *
   *  - HEAP: reporters measuring memory allocated by the heap allocator,
   *    e.g. by calling malloc, calloc, realloc, memalign, operator new, or
   *    operator new[].  Reporters in this category must have units
   *    UNITS_BYTES.
   *
   *  - NONHEAP: reporters measuring memory which the program explicitly
   *    allocated, but does not live on the heap.  Such memory is commonly
   *    allocated by calling one of the OS's memory-mapping functions (e.g.
   *    mmap, VirtualAlloc, or vm_allocate).  Reporters in this category
   *    must have units UNITS_BYTES.
   *
   *  - OTHER: reporters which don't fit into either of these categories.
   *    They can have any units.
   *
   * The kind only matters for reporters in the "explicit" tree;
   * aboutMemory.js uses it to calculate "heap-unclassified".
   *
   *
   * |units|  The units on the reporter's amount.  One of the following.
   *
   *  - BYTES: The amount contains a number of bytes.
   *
   *  - COUNT: The amount is an instantaneous count of things currently in
   *    existence.  For instance, the number of tabs currently open would have
   *    units COUNT.
   *
   *  - COUNT_CUMULATIVE: The amount contains the number of times some event
   *    has occurred since the application started up.  For instance, the
   *    number of times the user has opened a new tab would have units
   *    COUNT_CUMULATIVE.
   *
   *    The amount returned by a reporter with units COUNT_CUMULATIVE must
   *    never decrease over the lifetime of the application.
   *
   *  - PERCENTAGE: The amount contains a fraction that should be expressed as
   *    a percentage.  NOTE!  The |amount| field should be given a value 100x
   *    the actual percentage;  this number will be divided by 100 when shown.
   *    This allows a fractional percentage to be shown even though |amount| is
   *    an integer.  E.g. if the actual percentage is 12.34%, |amount| should
   *    be 1234.
   *
   *    Values greater than 100% are allowed.
   *
   *
   * |amount|  The numeric value reported by this memory reporter.  Accesses
   * can fail if something goes wrong when getting the amount.
   *
   *
   * |description|  A human-readable description of this memory usage report.

/*
 * An nsIMemoryReporter reports one or more memory measurements via a

 *
 * An nsIMemoryReporter that reports a single measurement is sometimes called a
 * "uni-reporter".  One that reports multiple measurements is sometimes called
 * a "multi-reporter".
 *
 * aboutMemory.js is the most important consumer of memory reports.  It
 * places the following constraints on reports.
 *
 * - All reports within a single sub-tree must have the same units.
 *
 * - There may be an "explicit" tree.  If present, it represents
 *   non-overlapping regions of memory that have been explicitly allocated with
 *   an OS-level allocation (e.g. mmap/VirtualAlloc/vm_allocate) or a
 *   heap-level allocation (e.g. malloc/calloc/operator new).  Reporters in
 *   this tree must have kind HEAP or NONHEAP, units BYTES.
 *
 * It is preferred, but not required, that report descriptions use complete
 * sentences (i.e. start with a capital letter and end with a period, or
 * similar).
