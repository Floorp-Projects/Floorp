   *   memory that have been explicitly allocated with an OS-level allocation
   *   (eg. mmap/VirtualAlloc/vm_allocate) or a heap-level allocation (eg.
   *   malloc/calloc/operator new).  Each one can be viewed as representing a
   *   path in a tree from the root node ("explicit") to a node lower in the
   *   tree; this lower node does not have to be a leaf node.
   *
   *   So, for example, "explicit/a/b", "explicit/a/c", "explicit/d",
   *   "explicit/d/e", and "explicit/d/f" define this tree:
   *
   *     explicit

   *     |  |--b [*]
   *     |  \--c [*]
   *     \--d [*]
   *        |--e [*]
   *        \--f [*]
   *
   *   Nodes marked with a [*] have a reporter.
   *
   * - All other paths represent cross-cuttings memory regions, ie. ones that
   *   may overlap arbitrarily with regions in the "explicit" tree.

   * memalign, operator new, operator new[], etc.  "OTHER" means it doesn't fit
