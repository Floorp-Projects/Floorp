 * An nsIMemoryReporter reports a single memory measurement as an object.
 * Use this when it makes sense to gather this measurement without gathering

 *
 * Note that the |amount| field may be implemented as a function, and so
 * accessing it can trigger significant computation;  the other fields can
 * be accessed without triggering this computation.  (Compare and contrast
 * this with nsIMemoryMultiReporter.)  
 *
 * aboutMemory.js is the most important consumer of memory reports.  It
 * places the following constraints on reports.
 *
 * - There must be an "explicit" tree.  It represents non-overlapping
 *   regions of memory that have been explicitly allocated with an
 *   OS-level allocation (e.g. mmap/VirtualAlloc/vm_allocate) or a
 *   heap-level allocation (e.g. malloc/calloc/operator new).  Reporters
 *   in this tree must have kind HEAP or NONHEAP, units BYTES, and a
 *   description that is a sentence (i.e. starts with a capital letter and
 *   ends with a period, or similar).
 *
 * - The "size", "rss", "pss" and "swap" trees are optional.  They
 *   represent regions of virtual memory that the process has mapped.
 *   Reporters in this category must have kind NONHEAP, units BYTES, and a
 *   non-empty description.
 *
 * - The "compartments" and "ghost-windows" trees are optional.  They are
 *   used by about:compartments.  Reporters in these trees must have kind
 *   OTHER, units COUNT, an amount of 1, and a description that's an empty
 *   string.
 *
 * - All other reports are unconstrained except that they must have a
 *   description that is a sentence.
