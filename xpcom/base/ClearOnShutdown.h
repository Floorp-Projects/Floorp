/*
 * This header exports two public methods in the mozilla namespace:
 *
 *   template<class SmartPtr>
 *   void ClearOnShutdown(SmartPtr *aPtr,
 * aPhase=ShutdownPhase::XPCOMShutdownFinal)
 *
 * This function takes a pointer to a smart pointer and nulls the smart pointer
 * on shutdown (and a particular phase of shutdown as needed).  If a phase
 * is specified, the ptr will be cleared at the start of that phase.  Also,
 * if a phase has already occurred when ClearOnShutdown() is called it will
 * cause a MOZ_ASSERT.  In case a phase is not explicitly cleared we will
 * clear it on the next phase that occurs.
 *
 * This is useful if you have a global smart pointer object which you don't
 * want to "leak" on shutdown.
 *
 * Although ClearOnShutdown will work with any smart pointer (i.e., nsCOMPtr,
 * RefPtr, StaticRefPtr, and StaticAutoPtr), you probably want to
 * use it only with StaticRefPtr and StaticAutoPtr.  There is no way to undo a
 * call to ClearOnShutdown, so you can call it only on smart pointers which you
 * know will live until the program shuts down.  In practice, these are likely
 * global variables, which should be Static{Ref,Auto}Ptr.
 *
 *   template <typename CallableT>
 *   void RunOnShutdown(CallableT&& aCallable,
 *                      aPhase = ShutdownPhase::XPCOMShutdownFinal)
 *
 * This function takes a callable and executes it upon shutdown at the start of
 * the specified phase. If the phase has already occurred when RunOnShutdown()
 * is called, it will cause a MOZ_ASSERT. In case a phase is not explicitly
 * cleared, we will clear it on the next phase that occurs.
 *
 * ClearOnShutdown and RunOnShutdown are both currently main-thread only because
 * we don't want to accidentally free an object from a different thread than the
 * one it was created on.
