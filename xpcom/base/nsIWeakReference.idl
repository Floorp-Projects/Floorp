 * own the proxy, and should generally manage it with an |nsCOMPtr| (see the
 * type |nsWeakPtr| for a |typedef| name that stands out) as they would any
 * other XPCOM object.  The |QueryReferent| member function provides a
 * (hopefully short-lived) owning reference on demand, through which clients
 * can get useful access to the referent, while it still exists.
