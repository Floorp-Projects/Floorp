// Abstracts executing runnables in order on an arbitrary event target. The
// runnables dispatched to the TaskQueue will be executed in the order in which
// they're received, and are guaranteed to not be executed concurrently.
// They may be executed on different threads, and a memory barrier is used
// to make this threadsafe for objects that aren't already threadsafe.
//
// Note, since a TaskQueue can also be converted to an nsIEventTarget using
// WrapAsEventTarget() its possible to construct a hierarchy of TaskQueues.
// Consider these three TaskQueues:
//
//  TQ1 dispatches to the main thread
//  TQ2 dispatches to TQ1
//  TQ3 dispatches to TQ1
//
// This ensures there is only ever a single runnable from the entire chain on
// the main thread.  It also ensures that TQ2 and TQ3 only have a single
// runnable in TQ1 at any time.
//
// This arrangement lets you prioritize work by dispatching runnables directly
// to TQ1.  You can issue many runnables for important work.  Meanwhile the TQ2
// and TQ3 work will always execute at most one runnable and then yield.
//
// A TaskQueue does not require explicit shutdown, however it provides a
// BeginShutdown() method that places TaskQueue in a shut down state and returns
// a promise that gets resolved once all pending tasks have completed
