How to report bugs
==================

To report a bug, send mail either to gtk-list, as mentioned
above, or to gtk-bugs@gtk.org. If you send mail to gtk-list, you
must be subscribed yourself.

In the mail include:

* The version of GLib

* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What operating system and version
   - What version of X
   - For Linux, what version of the C library

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug. 

  If you can reproduce it with the testglib program that is built 
  in the glib/ directory, that will be most convenient.  Otherwise, 
  please include a short test program that exhibits the behavior. 
  As a last resort, you can also provide a pointer to a larger piece 
  of software that can be downloaded.

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out
  when the crash occured.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but
  is not necessary.

Patches
=======

Patches can be uploaded to the incoming/ directory on
ftp.gtk.org.  Please follow the instructions there, and include
your name and email address in the README file.

If the patch fixes a bug, it is usually a good idea to include
all the information described in "How to Report Bugs".
