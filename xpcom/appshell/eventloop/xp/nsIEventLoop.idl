/*
	There are three basic types of Event Loops that can exist in a system.
	1.)  There is the Main Event loop that services the application.  This 
	is typically what would be found at the bottom of a main().  Event loops
	of this type are specified with the 'MainAppLoop' type.  There can only
	be one of these per Application.  It is also important to note that
	Run() called on a Loop of this type blocks until the loop exits.
	2.)  User-interface threads are distinct from worker threads in that they
	provide an event loop that services native system events.  This is the loop
	that that is found at the bottom of the ThreadMain often looking very
	similar to the one found in main().  Event loops of this type are specified
	with the 'ThreadLoop' type.  There can only be one of these per thread.It is
	also important to note that Run() called on a Loop of this type blocks
	until the loop exits.
	3.)  The third type of loop that exists is one that is done to allow the 
	application and sytem to "breathe".  This loop is often invoked from various
	places on the stack virtually always with the main thread loop living down 
	the stack in some fashion.  Great care should be taken in using loops of
	this kind.  Event loops of this type are specified with the 'AppBreathLoop'
	type.  There can be as many of these per application as the application
	wishes to create.  This loop is different than others with respect to the
	way Run() works on events of this type.  Run() will return once the app
	has had suffiecient breathe time.  This may be once the event queue is
	empty or may be after a specified yield time.  As loops of this type aren't
	tied to the life of a thread or app, the return from Run() does not
	indicate the desire to end a thread or app either.
