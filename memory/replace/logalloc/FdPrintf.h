/* We can't use libc's (f)printf because it would reenter in replace_malloc,
 * So use a custom and simplified version.  Only %p, %zu, %s and %% are
 * supported, %zu, %s, support width specifiers.
 *
 * /!\ This function used a fixed-size internal buffer. The caller is
 * expected to not use a format string that may overflow.
 * The aFd argument is a file descriptor on UNIX and a native win32 file
 * handle on Windows (from CreateFile). We can't use the windows POSIX
 * APIs is that they don't support O_APPEND in a multi-process-safe way,
 * while CreateFile does.
