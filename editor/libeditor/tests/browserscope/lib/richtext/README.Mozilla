The BrowserScope project provides a set of cross-browser HTML editor tests,
which we import in our test suite in order to run them as part of our
continuous integration system.

We pull tests occasionally from their Subversion repository using the pull
script which can be found in this directory.  We also record the revision ID
which we've used in the current_revision file inside this directory.

Using the pull script is quite easy, just switch to this directory, and say:

sh update_from_upstream

There are tests which we're currently failing on, and there will probably be
more of those in the future.  We should maintain a list of the failing tests
manually in currentStatus.js (which can also be found in this directory), to
make sure that the suite passes entirely, with failing tests marked as todo
items.
