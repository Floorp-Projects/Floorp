README FOR BROWSERSCOPE
-----------------------

Hey there - thanks for downloading the code. This file has instructions
for getting setup so that you can run the codebase locally.

This project is built on Google App Engine using the
Django web application framework and written in Python.

To get started, you'll need to first download the App Engine SDK at:
http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html

For local development, just startup the server:
./pathto/google_appengine/dev_appserver.py --port=8080 browserscope

You should then be able to access the local application at:
http://localhost:8080/

Note: the first time you hit the homepage it may take a little
while - that's because it's trying to read out median times for all
of the tests from a nonexistent datastore and write to memcache.
Just be a lil patient.

You can run the unit tests at:
  http://localhost:8080/test


CONTRIBUTING
------------------

Most likely you are interested in adding new tests or creating
a new test category. If you are interested in adding tests to an existing
"category" you may want to get in touch with the maintainer for that
branch of the tree. We are really looking forward to receiving your
code in patch format. Currently the category maintainers are:
Network: Steve Souders <souders@gmail.com>
Reflow: Lindsey Simon <elsigh@gmail.com>
Security: Adam Barth <adam@adambarth.com> and Collin Jackson <collin@collinjackson.com>


To create a completely new test category:
  * Copy one of the existing directories in categories/
  * Edit your test_set.py, handlers.py
  * Add your files in templates/ and static/
  * Update urls.py and settings.CATEGORIES
  * Follow the examples of other tests re:
      * beaconing using/testdriver_base
      * your GetScoreAndDisplayValue method
      * your GetRowScoreAndDisplayValue method
