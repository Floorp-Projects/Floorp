# This script can be used to build the mozldap rpms and srpm.  It assumes
# you begin with nothing but this script.  You must have nspr, nspr-devel,
# nss, and nss-devel, and svrcore-devel installed on your system in order to run this script.  Not
# only will the script check, but the rpmbuild will also check and bomb out if
# those dependencies are not present.  The script allows you to build the rpm
# as a non root user and puts the build files under the current directory.  This
# script does not install the rpm.
#
# You may need to edit this script to change:
# the versions of nspr and nss and svrcore used
# the CVS tag for pulling mozldap
# the mozldap version and release - these should match the spec file

# Always switch into the base directory of this
# shell script prior to executing it so that all
# of its output is written to this directory
