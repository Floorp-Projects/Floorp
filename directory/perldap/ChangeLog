1999-03-21  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* Checked in v1.2.1(beta).

1999-03-19  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	<stephen@networks.com>.
	(addValue): Bug fix, when calling delete, and then
	addValue(). From Stephen P. Schaefer as well.

	would print multiple values.

1999-03-12  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* Conn.pm: Changed docs for modifyRDN(), it was wrong...

1999-03-11  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* Entry.pm (new): Added this method, so that "new ...::Entry" will
	work as expected.

1999-03-09  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* Entry.pm: Tons of changes to handling the save/modified/deleted
	attribute values.

	let's try it to make sure it works...

	* Conn.pm (nextEntry): Fixed (tried to fix...) the bug with
	missing attributes. I hope this will work, at a minimum I'm sure

	normalization.

	avoide calling the TIEHASH methods.

	(ALL): Clean out some "my" definitions.

	* Entry.pm (unRemove): New function, to undo remove opertaions on
	an attribute.

	it's zero if we don't find anything.

	* Entry.pm (FIRSTKEY): Modified to honor the oc_order.
	(NEXTKEY): Dito.
	(markModified): Made as an alias for attrModified().

	* Conn.pm (nextEntry): Added code to handle internal counters for
	number of attributes in oc_order. This is used/needed for the
	FIRSTKEY and NEXTKEY methods in the Entry/Tie::Hash object.

	* Entry.pm (isAttr): New method, to make sure an attribute name
	really is a valid LDAP attribute.
	(FIRSTKEY): Now we'll handle each() and keys() properly, whooohoo!

1998-12-04  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* Makefile.PL: Modified so that "silent" install will actually
	echo what options it's setting.
	It will now croak() if the SDK dir specified doesn't exist.

	* INSTALL: Updated to reflect new v1.1 stuff. Added links to the
	FAQ.

	* README: Dito. Also changed some of the binary install
	information, which might not be useful anyways...

1998-09-18  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* LDIF.pm (readEntries): Changed tests for empty arguments, to use
	defined().

	* Utils.pm (ldapArgs): Bug fix, we used the wrong option for the

	"external" DN as an argument, if supplied.

1998-08-02  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* Conn.pm (getErrorCode): Now takes two optional arguments, to
	return the match string, and extra error string. Note that these
	two arguments are pointers to strings!

	to work now...
