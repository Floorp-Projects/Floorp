	* Makefile.PL: Fixed so that automated installs works.

	* Conn.pm (update): Fixed narly bug with ldap_modify()...

	* All: Cleaned up some hash indexes, to make sure they are
	properly quoted, and there are no conflicts to resolve.
	
	* Entry.pm (STORE): Fixed a bug with attribute names not being
	properly added to _oc_order_.
	(addValue): Dito, added the same code as for STORE.

1998-08-06  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* Entry.pm (printLDIF): Copied/modified from the Utils.pm library.
	(isModified): Added this function, thought it might be useful.

1998-08-03  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* Conn.pm (modifyRDN): Fixed! It also has an option to take an
	"external" DN as an argument, if supplied.

1998-08-02  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* Conn.pm (getErrorCode): Now takes two optional arguments, to
	return the match string, and extra error string. Note that these
	two arguments are pointers to strings!

	* API.xs(ldap_get_lderrno): Fixed this function, at least it seems
	to work now...

	* Conn.pm (getLD): Added this function, convenient way to get the
	LD from the OO layer.

1998-07-30  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* Conn.pm (modifyRDN): New method, to rename the RDN of the entry.

	* Utils.pm (answer): New function, from LdapUtils.pm.

	* Conn.pm (delete): Fixed references to normalizeDN.

	* Utils.pm (userCredentials): Added this function, to make it easy
	to get credentials when binding as a user.
	(normalizeDN): Fixed bugs, because of calling convention...

	* Conn.pm (getError): Fixed bug with passing read-only argument.

1998-07-29  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* Utils.pm (unixCrypt): Moved from my LdapUtils.pm module.
	Added askPassword to the export tag.

	* Conn.pm (new): Added support for passing a hash array of all the
	parameters, as returned by the ldapArgs() function.

	* Utils.pm (str2Scope): New function, for converting strings
	(subtree) to a numerical scope value (2).
	(askPassword): Dito, ask for a password, interactively.
	(ldapArgs): Dito, handle common LDAP command line arguments.

	* Makefile.PL: Minor change, to do regex match on OS version for
	MSWin.

	* Entry.pm: Changed all _XXX hash values to also end with a _,
	hence making it easier to isolate them (/^_.*_$/).

	* Conn.pm (nextEntry): Changed to accept that the attributes are
	now arrays, not pointers to arrays. We still consider them as
	pointers internally though, it's cleaner API.

	* API.pm: Changed to use the native Exporter function to export
	tags into EXPORT_OK.

1998-07-22  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* LDIF.pm (readEntry): Moved from my LdapUtils.pm package.

	* Utils.pm (printEntry): Moved from the ::Connection class, and
	marked it as "obsolete".
	(encodeBase64): Moved from my LdapUtils.pm package.
	(decodeBase64): Dito.
