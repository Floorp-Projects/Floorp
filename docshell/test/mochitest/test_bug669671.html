/**
 * Test for Bug 669671.
 *
 * This is a bit complicated.  We have a script, file_bug669671.sjs, which counts
 * how many times it's loaded and returns that count in the body of an HTML
 * document.  For brevity, call this page X.
 *
 * X is sent with Cache-Control: max-age=0 and can't be bfcached (it has an
 * onunload handler).  Our test does the following in a popup:
 *
 * 1) Load X?pushed, to prime the cache.
 * 2) Navigate to X.
 * 3) Call pushState and navigate from X to X?pushed.
 * 4) Navigate to X?navigated.
 * 5) Go back (to X?pushed).
 *
 * We do all this work so we can check that in step 5, we fetch X?pushed from
 * the network -- we shouldn't use our cached copy, because of the
 * cache-control header X sends.
 *
 * Then we go back and repeat the whole process but call history.replaceState
 * instead of pushState.  And for good measure, we test once more, this time
 * modifying only the hash of the URI using replaceState.  In this case, we
 * *should* load from the cache.
 *
