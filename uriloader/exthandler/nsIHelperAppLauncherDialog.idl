/**
 * nsIHelperAppLauncherDialog
 * ==========================
 * This interface is used to display a confirmatino dialog before
 * launching a "helper app" to handle content not handled by
 * Mozilla.
 *
 * Usage:  Clients (of which there is one: the nsIExternalHelperAppService
 * implementation in mozilla/uriloader/exthandler) create an instance of
 * this interface (using the contract ID) and then call the show() method.
 *
 * The dialog is shown non-modally.  The implementation of the dialog
 * will access methods of the nsIHelperAppLauncher passed in to show()
 * in order to cause a "save to disk" or "open using" action.
 *
 * Note: The promptForSaveToFile and showProgressDialog methods are
 *       obsolescent.  Caller(s) will be converted to use specific
 *       file-picker and progress-dialog interfaces.
