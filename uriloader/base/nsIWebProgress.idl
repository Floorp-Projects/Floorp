/**
 * The nsIWebProgress interface is used to add or remove nsIWebProgressListener
 * instances to observe the loading of asynchronous requests (usually in the
 * context of a DOM window).
 *
 * nsIWebProgress instances may be arranged in a parent-child configuration,
 * corresponding to the parent-child configuration of their respective DOM
 * windows.  However, in some cases a nsIWebProgress instance may not have an
 * associated DOM window.  The parent-child relationship of nsIWebProgress
 * instances is not made explicit by this interface, but the relationship may
 * exist in some implementations.
 *
 * A nsIWebProgressListener instance receives notifications for the
 * nsIWebProgress instance to which it added itself, and it may also receive
 * notifications from any nsIWebProgress instances that are children of that
 * nsIWebProgress instance.
