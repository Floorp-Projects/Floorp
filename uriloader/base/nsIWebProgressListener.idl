  /**
   * State Transition Flags
   *
   * These flags indicate the various states that requests may transition
   * through as they are being loaded.  These flags are mutually exclusive.
   *
   * For any given request, onStateChange is called once with the STATE_START
   * flag, zero or more times with the STATE_TRANSFERRING flag or once with the
   * STATE_REDIRECTING flag, and then finally once with the STATE_STOP flag.
   * NOTE: For document requests, a second STATE_STOP is generated (see the
   * description of STATE_IS_WINDOW for more details).
   *
   * STATE_START
   *   This flag indicates the start of a request.  This flag is set when a
   *   request is initiated.  The request is complete when onStateChange is
   *   called for the same request with the STATE_STOP flag set.
   *
   * STATE_REDIRECTING
   *   This flag indicates that a request is being redirected.  The request
   *   passed to onStateChange is the request that is being redirected.  When a
   *   redirect occurs, a new request is generated automatically to process the
   *   new request.  Expect a corresponding STATE_START event for the new
   *   request, and a STATE_STOP for the redirected request.
   *
   * STATE_TRANSFERRING
   *   This flag indicates that data for a request is being transferred to an
   *   end consumer.  This flag indicates that the request has been targeted,
   *   and that the user may start seeing content corresponding to the request.
   *
   * STATE_NEGOTIATING
   *   This flag is not used.
   *
   * STATE_STOP
   *   This flag indicates the completion of a request.  The aStatus parameter
   *   to onStateChange indicates the final status of the request.

  /**
   * State Type Flags
   *
   * These flags further describe the entity for which the state transition is
   * occuring.  These flags are NOT mutually exclusive (i.e., an onStateChange
   * event may indicate some combination of these flags).
   *
   * STATE_IS_REQUEST
   *   This flag indicates that the state transition is for a request, which
   *   includes but is not limited to document requests.  (See below for a
   *   description of document requests.)  Other types of requests, such as
   *   requests for inline content (e.g., images and stylesheets) are
   *   considered normal requests.
   *
   * STATE_IS_DOCUMENT
   *   This flag indicates that the state transition is for a document request.
   *   This flag is set in addition to STATE_IS_REQUEST.  A document request
   *   supports the nsIChannel interface and its loadFlags attribute includes
   *   the nsIChannel::LOAD_DOCUMENT_URI flag.
   *
   *   A document request does not complete until all requests associated with
   *   the loading of its corresponding document have completed.  This includes
   *   other document requests (e.g., corresponding to HTML <iframe> elements).
   *   The document corresponding to a document request is available via the
   *   DOMWindow attribute of onStateChange's aWebProgress parameter.
   *
   * STATE_IS_NETWORK
   *   This flag indicates that the state transition corresponds to the start
   *   or stop of activity in the indicated nsIWebProgress instance.  This flag
   *   is accompanied by either STATE_START or STATE_STOP, and it may be
   *   combined with other State Type Flags.
   *
   *   Unlike STATE_IS_WINDOW, this flag is only set when activity within the
   *   nsIWebProgress instance being observed starts or stops.  If activity
   *   only occurs in a child nsIWebProgress instance, then this flag will be
   *   set to indicate the start and stop of that activity.
   *
   *   For example, in the case of navigation within a single frame of a HTML
   *   frameset, a nsIWebProgressListener instance attached to the
   *   nsIWebProgress of the frameset window will receive onStateChange calls
   *   with the STATE_IS_NETWORK flag set to indicate the start and stop of
   *   said navigation.  In other words, an observer of an outer window can
   *   determine when activity, that may be constrained to a child window or
   *   set of child windows, starts and stops.
   *
   * STATE_IS_WINDOW
   *   This flag indicates that the state transition corresponds to the start
   *   or stop of activity in the indicated nsIWebProgress instance.  This flag
   *   is accompanied by either STATE_START or STATE_STOP, and it may be
   *   combined with other State Type Flags.
   *
   *   This flag is similar to STATE_IS_DOCUMENT.  However, when a document
   *   request completes, two onStateChange calls with STATE_STOP are
   *   generated.  The document request is passed as aRequest to both calls.
   *   The first has STATE_IS_REQUEST and STATE_IS_DOCUMENT set, and the second
   *   has the STATE_IS_WINDOW flag set (and possibly the STATE_IS_NETWORK flag
   *   set as well -- see above for a description of when the STATE_IS_NETWORK
   *   flag may be set).  This second STATE_STOP event may be useful as a way
   *   to partition the work that occurs when a document request completes.
   *
   * STATE_IS_REDIRECTED_DOCUMENT
   *  Same as STATE_IS_DOCUMENT, but sent only after a redirect has occured.
   *  Introduced in order not to confuse existing code with extra state change
   *  events. See |nsDocLoader::OnStartRequest| for more info.
