/**
 * The uri dispatcher is responsible for taking uri's, determining
 * the content and routing the opened url to the correct content 
 * handler. 
 *
 * When you encounter a url you want to open, you typically call 
 * openURI, passing it the content listener for the window the uri is 
 * originating from. The uri dispatcher opens the url to discover the 
 * content type. It then gives the content listener first crack at 
 * handling the content. If it doesn't want it, the dispatcher tries
 * to hand it off one of the registered content listeners. This allows
 * running applications the chance to jump in and handle the content.
 *
 * If that also fails, then the uri dispatcher goes to the registry
 * looking for the preferred content handler for the content type
 * of the uri. The content handler may create an app instance
 * or it may hand the contents off to a platform specific plugin
 * or helper app. Or it may hand the url off to an OS registered 
 * application.
