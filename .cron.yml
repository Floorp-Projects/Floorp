      # nightly which is designed to align with searchfox's AWS cron
      # jobs (for legacy reasons) rather than trying to align with
      # specific builds.  (Ex: mozilla-beta has a "daily-releases" job
      # that currently runs 3 times a week.)
      #
      # Note that for branches that don't change a lot this will result
      # in a redundant job being scheduled each day rather than reusing
      # the previous day's job.  This is only beneficial in the sense
      # that there's no risk of expiration for artifacts and is a
      # trade-off to avoid stale indices.  Bug 1686981 tracks fixing
      # this.
