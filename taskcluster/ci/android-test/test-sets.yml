# Each key in this file specifies a set of tests to run.  Different test sets
# may, for example, be bound to different test platforms.
#
# Note that set does not depend on the tree; tree-dependent job selection
# should be performed in the target task selection phase of task-graph
# generation.
#
# A test set has a name, and a list of tests that it contains.
#
# Test names given here reference tests.yml.
