# Note: --exclude-command .--line-numbers is because of
# https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=879003
# That skips `objdump --disassemble --line-numbers` and falls back to
# `objdump --disassemble`
# Note: the .chk excludes are for files that are known to differ between
# builds because they are signed with an ephemeral private key that is
# generated for each build.
