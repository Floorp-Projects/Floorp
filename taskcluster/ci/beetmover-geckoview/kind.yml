            # As of December 2019, we have automated betas shipped without being
            # blocked on QA, hence we can upload geckoview as part of the
            # `push` phase of the release graphs.
            # So we want beetmover to act only when the release is greenlit. That
            # is to say:
            # 1. (to be changed soon to be as part of the nightly graph) right after nightly builds on mozilla-central
            # 2. as part of Firefox push graphs on both mozilla-beta and mozilla-release
            # 3. as part of ship-rc graphs on Firefox RC
            # 4. at every patch uplifted on the GECKOVIEW_XX_RELBRANCH on mozilla-release
            # Reminder: There is no Android/geckoview build on ESR.
            #
            # The logic of point 2 and 3 is handled in target_tasks directly because it's mixing and
            # matching 2 different shipping-products
