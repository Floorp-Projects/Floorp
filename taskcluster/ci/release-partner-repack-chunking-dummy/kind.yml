loader: taskgraph.loader.single_dep:loader

transforms:
    - taskgraph.transforms.chunk_partners:transforms
    - taskgraph.transforms.name_sanity:transforms
    # This transform sets build_platform to the same thing as the upstream task.
    # We'd do it here, except single_dep doesn't pay attention to any
    # per platform things that we set.
    - taskgraph.transforms.copy_attributes_from_dependent_task:transforms
    # This transform is needed because task.py doesn't allow "primary-dependency" to be
    # set, but the single_dep loader sets it (and we need it for chunk_partners,
    # name_sanity, and copy_build_platform_from_dependent_task to work).
