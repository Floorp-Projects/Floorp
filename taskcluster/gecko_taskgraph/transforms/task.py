These transformations take a task description and turn it into a TaskCluster
task definition (along with attributes, label, etc.).  The input to these
transformations is generic to any kind of task, but abstracts away some of the
complexities of worker implementations, scopes, and treeherder annotations.

        # with the current run-task! For out-of-tree Docker images, we have no
        # way of knowing their content of run-task. So, in addition to varying

        # the run-task content into the cache name. However, doing so preserves
        # the mechanism whereby changing run-task results in new caches
        # everywhere.
