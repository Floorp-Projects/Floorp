# Security Concerns
#
# An "interactive task" is, quite literally, shell access to a worker. That
# is limited by being in a Docker container, but we assume that Docker has
# bugs so we do not want to rely on container isolation exclusively.
#
# Interactive tasks should never be allowed on hosts that build binaries
# leading to a release -- level 3 builders.
#
# Users must not be allowed to create interactive tasks for tasks above
# their own level.
#
# Interactive tasks must not have any routes that might make them appear
# in the index to be used by other production tasks.
#
# Interactive tasks should not be able to write to any docker-worker caches.
