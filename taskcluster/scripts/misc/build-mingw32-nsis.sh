# --exclude-libs is not supported by lld, but is not required anyways.
# /fixed is passed by the build system when building with MSVC but not
# when building with GCC/binutils. The build system doesn't really support
# clang/lld, but apparently binutils and lld don't have the same defaults
# related to this. Unfortunately, /fixed is necessary for the stubs to be
# handled properly by the resource editor in NSIS, which doesn't handle
# relocations, so we pass the equivalent flag to lld-link through lld through
# clang.
