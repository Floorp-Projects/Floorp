Artifact upload has been disabled for this build due to infrequent usage of the
generated artifacts.  If you find yourself in a position where you need the
shell or similar artifacts from this build, please redo your push with the
environment variable MOZ_JS_UPLOAD_BINARIES set to 1.  You can provide this as
the option `--env MOZ_JS_UPLOAD_BINARIES=1` to `mach try fuzzy` or `mach try auto`.
