<!--
     Entitlements to apply to the .app bundle and all executable files
     contained within it during codesigning of production channel builds that
     will be notarized. These entitlements enable hardened runtime protections
     to the extent possible for Firefox. Some supporting binaries within the
     bundle could use more restrictive entitlements, but they are launched by
     the main Firefox process and therefore inherit the parent process
     entitlements.
