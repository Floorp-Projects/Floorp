GTest-based Unit Tests

This directory contains GTest-based unit tests for NSS libssl.

If your environment doesn't have C++ compiler suitable to build these tests,
you may disable them using ``NSS_DISABLE_GTESTS=1''

Once built, they are run as part of running ``test/all.sh''
You can run just the GTests by running ``tests/ssl_gtests/ssl_gtests.sh''

They can be run standalone or under a debugger by invoking the ssl_gtest
executable with a ``-d'' option pointing to the directory created by either
of the above options.  You can find that in

  tests_results/security/${hostname}.${NUMBER}/ssl_gtests
