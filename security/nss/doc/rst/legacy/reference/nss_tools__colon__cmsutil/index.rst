   Synopsis

   cmsutil [options] `arguments <arguments>`__

   Description

   | The cmsutil command-line uses the S/MIME Toolkit to perform basic
   | operations, such as encryption and decryption, on Cryptographic Message
   | Syntax (CMS) messages.

   | To run cmsutil, type the command cmsutil option [arguments] where option
   | and arguments are combinations of the options and arguments listed in the
   | following section. Each command takes one option. Each option may take
   | zero or more arguments. To see a usage string, issue the command without
   | options.

   Options and Arguments

   Options

   | Options specify an action. Option arguments modify an action. The options
   | and arguments for the cmsutil command are defined as follows:

   -D

   Decode a message.

   -C

   Encrypt a message.

   -E

   Envelope a message.

   -O

   Create a certificates-only message.

   -S

   Sign a message.

   Arguments

   Option arguments modify an action and are lowercase.

   -c content

   Use this detached content (decode only).

   -d dbdir

   Specify the key/certificate database directory (default is ".")

   -e envfile

   | Specify a file containing an enveloped message for a set of
   | recipients to which you would like to send an encrypted message.
   | If this is the first encrypted message for that set of recipients,
   | a new enveloped message will be created that you can then use for
   | future messages (encrypt only).

   -G

   Include a signing time attribute (sign only).

   -h num

   Generate email headers with info about CMS message (decode only).

   -i infile

   Use infile as a source of data (default is stdin).

   -N nickname

   Specify nickname of certificate to sign with (sign only).

   -n

   Suppress output of contents (decode only).

   -o outfile

   Use outfile as a destination of data (default is stdout).

   -P

   -p password

   Use password as key database password.

   -r recipient1,recipient2, ...

   | Specify list of recipients (email addresses) for an encrypted or
   | enveloped message. For certificates-only message, list of
   | certificates to send.

   -T

   Suppress content in CMS message (sign only).

   -u certusage

   Set type of cert usage (default is certUsageEmailSigner).

   -Y ekprefnick

   Specify an encryption key preference by nickname.
