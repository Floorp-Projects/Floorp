   .. rubric:: Files
      :name: files

   -  Results from every C file are on new line.
   -  If file was tested, link points to annotated source file (in TCOV directory), otherwise to
      original source file (CVS directory).

   .. rubric:: Colors
      :name: colors

   -  Green: 70-100% of blocks tested.
   -  Yellow: 40-70% of blocks tested.
   -  Orange: 0-40% of blocks tested.
   -  Red: file not tested. File is not part of any binary or library used by test suite.

   .. rubric:: Numbers in tested files
      :name: numbers_in_tested_files

   -  Example: 72.69% (165/227/731)

      -  72.69% - ratio of tested blocks and total blocks in file (generated by TCOV).
      -  165 - tested blocks in file (generated by TCOV).
      -  227 - total blocks in file (generated by TCOV).
      -  31 - total lines in file (by wc -l command).

   .. rubric:: Numbers in not tested files
      :name: numbers_in_not_tested_files

   -  Example: Not tested (0/?/878).

      -  0 - tested blocks in file (always 0).
      -   ? - total blocks in file (there is no trivial method to get this number without TCOV).
      -  878 - total lines in file (by wc -l command).

   .. rubric:: Numbers in total count
      :name: numbers_in_total_count

   -  Example: Total: 42% (574/1351).

      -  42% - ratio of tested blocks and total blocks in file.
      -  165 - tested blocks in all files in directory (sum of numbers generated by TCOV).
      -  227 - total blocks in all files in directory (sum of numbers generated by TCOV).

   -  These numbers doesn't count blocks in files which are not tested (marked with red color),
      because we don't know number of blocks there.
   -  Total count at the end of report counts blocks in all tested files in all directories.
