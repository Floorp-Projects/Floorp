--------------------------------------------------------

.. container::

   NSS version 3.28, 3.28.1 and 3.28.2 contained changes that were in violation with the NSS
   compatibility promise.

   ECParams, which is part of the public API of the freebl/softokn parts of NSS, had been changed to
   include an additional attribute. That size increase caused crashes or malfunctioning with
   applications that use that data structure directly, or indirectly through ECPublicKey,
   ECPrivateKey, NSSLOWKEYPublicKey, NSSLOWKEYPrivateKey, or potentially other data structures that
   reference ECParams. The change has been reverted to the original state in `bug
   1334108 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1334108>`__.

   SECKEYECPublicKey had been extended with a new attribute, named "encoding". If an application
   passed type SECKEYECPublicKey to NSS (as part of SECKEYPublicKey), the NSS library read the
   uninitialized attribute. With this NSS release SECKEYECPublicKey.encoding is deprecated. NSS no
   longer reads the attribute, and will always set it to ECPoint_Undefined. See `bug
   1340103 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1340103>`__.

`Compatibility <#compatibility>`__
----------------------------------

.. container::

   NSS 3.28.3 shared libraries are backward compatible with most older NSS 3.x shared libraries, but
   depending on your application, may be incompatible, if you application has been compiled against
   header files of versions 3.28, 3.28.1, or 3.28.2.

   A program linked with most older NSS 3.x shared libraries (excluding the exceptions mentioned
   above), will work with NSS 3.28.3 shared libraries without recompiling or relinking. Furthermore,
   applications that restrict their use of NSS APIs to the functions listed in NSS Public Functions
   will remain compatible with future versions of the NSS shared libraries.

   If you had compiled your application against header files of NSS 3.28, NSS 3.28.1 or NSS 3.28.2,
   it is recommended that you recompile your application against NSS 3.28.3, at the time you upgrade
   to NSS 3.28.3.

   Please note that NSS 3.29 also contained the incorrect change. You should avoid using NSS 3.29,
   and rather use NSS 3.29.1 or a newer version. See also the
   :ref:`mozilla_projects_nss_nss_3_29_1_release_notes`
