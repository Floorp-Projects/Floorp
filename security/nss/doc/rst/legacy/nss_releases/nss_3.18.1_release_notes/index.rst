   -  The following CA certificate had the Websites and Code Signing trust **bits restored to their
      original state** to allow more time to develop a better transition strategy for affected
      sites. The Websites and Code Signing trust bits were turned off in
      :ref:`mozilla_projects_nss_nss_3_18_release_notes`. But when Firefox 38 went into Beta, there
      was a huge spike in the number of certificate verification errors attributed to this change.
      So, to give website administrators more time to update their web servers, we reverted the
      trust bits back to being enabled.

----------------------------------

.. container::

   NSS 3.18.1 shared libraries are backward compatible with all older NSS 3.18 shared libraries. A
   program linked with older NSS 3.18 shared libraries will work with NSS 3.18.1 shared libraries
   without recompiling or relinking. Furthermore, applications that restrict their use of NSS APIs
   to the functions listed in NSS Public Functions will remain compatible with future versions of
   the NSS shared libraries.
