----------------------------------------------------

.. container::

   - Bug 1756271 - Remove token member from NSSSlot struct.


`Compatibility <#compatibility>`__
----------------------------------

.. container::

   NSS 3.76.1 shared libraries are backwards-compatible with all older NSS 3.x shared
   libraries. A program linked with older NSS 3.x shared libraries will work with
   this new version of the shared libraries without recompiling or
   relinking. Furthermore, applications that restrict their use of NSS APIs to the
   functions listed in NSS Public Functions will remain compatible with future
   versions of the NSS shared libraries.

`Feedback <#feedback>`__
------------------------

.. container::

   Bugs discovered should be reported by filing a bug report on
   `bugzilla.mozilla.org <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=NSS>`__ (product NSS).

`Notes <#notes>`__
------------------

.. container::

   This release improves the stability of NSS when used in a multi-threaded
   environment. In particular, it fixes memory safety violations that can occur
   when PKCS#11 tokens are removed while in use (CVE-2022-1097). We presume
   that with enough effort these memory safety violations are exploitable.
