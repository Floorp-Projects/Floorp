`Compatibility <#compatibility>`__
----------------------------------

.. container::

   NSS 3.69.1 shared libraries are backwards-compatible with all older NSS 3.x shared libraries. A
   program linked with older NSS 3.x shared libraries will work with NSS 3.69.1 shared libraries
   without recompiling or relinking. Furthermore, applications that restrict their use of NSS APIs
   to the functions listed in NSS Public Functions will remain compatible with future versions of
   the NSS shared libraries.

   Bugs discovered should be reported by filing a bug report on

`Notes <#notes>`__
------------------

.. container::

   NSS 3.69.1 is a dot release based on the content of Firefox 92. Due to some issues with
   the process for bringing NSS releases to Firefox, commits for 1722613 and 1720226 were absent
   from the Firefox 92 branch which was associated to NSS 3.69. Due to time constraints a decision
   was made to align the content of 3.69.1 with the Fx92 branch by backing out these changes instead
   of restoring these commits.

   Note that Bug 1720226 was also known to introduce a performance regression that has been fixed
   in the main/default branch of NSS (Bug 1726022). Since the change has been backed out in this
   release, 3.69.1 does not suffer from that performance regression.

   This fix is not in 3.69 (which is affected) but will be in the 3.70 branch, which benefits from
   both the change and the fix for the regression.

   The NSS 3.70 release is on schedule and will happen on September 2nd.
