This README file explains how to add a builtin root CA certificate to NSS.
The builtin root CA certificates in NSS are stored in the nssckbi PKCS #11
module. The sources to the nssckbi module are in this directory. You need
to use the addbuiltin command-line tool to add a root CA certificate to
the nssckbi module. In the procedure described below, we assume that the
new root CA certificate is distributed in DER format in the file newroot.der.

1. Build addbuiltin by doing gmake in mozilla/security/nss/cmd/addbuiltin.
(addbuiltin is not built by default.)

2. Add the directory where the addbuiltin executable resides to your PATH
environment variable. Then, add the directory where the NSPR and NSS shared
libraries (DLLs) reside to the platform-specific environment variable that
specifies your shared library search path: LD_LIBRARY_PATH (most Unix
variants), SHLIB_PATH (32-bit HP-UX), LIBPATH (AIX), or PATH (Windows).

3. Copy newroot.der to this directory.

4. In this directory, run addbuiltin to add the new root certificate. The
argument to the -n option should be replaced by the name of the root
certificate. Then run "gmake generate".

    % addbuiltin -n "Name of the Root Certificate" -t C,C,C < newroot.der >> certdata.txt
    % gmake generate

5. Edit nssckbi.h to bump the version of the module.

6. Run gmake in this directory to build the nssckbi module.

7. After you verify that the new nssckbi module is correct, check in
certdata.txt, certdata.c, and nssckbi.h.
