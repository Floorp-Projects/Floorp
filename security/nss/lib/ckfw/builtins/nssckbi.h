 * NSS BUILTINS Version numbers.

 * this release on NSS. To determine the version numbers of the builtin
 * module you are using, use the appropriate PKCS #11 calls.
 *
 * These version numbers detail changes to the PKCS #11 interface. They map
 * to the PKCS #11 spec versions.

/* These version numbers detail the changes
 * to the list of trusted certificates.
 *
 * The NSS_BUILTINS_LIBRARY_VERSION_MINOR macro needs to be bumped
 * whenever we change the list of trusted certificates.
 *
 * Please use the following rules when increasing the version number:
 *
 * - starting with version 2.14, NSS_BUILTINS_LIBRARY_VERSION_MINOR
 *   must always be an EVEN number (e.g. 16, 18, 20 etc.)
 *
 * - whenever possible, if older branches require a modification to the
 *   list, these changes should be made on the main line of development (trunk),
 *   and the older branches should update to the most recent list.
 *
 * - ODD minor version numbers are reserved to indicate a snapshot that has
 *   deviated from the main line of development, e.g. if it was necessary
 *   to modify the list on a stable branch.
 *   Once the version has been changed to an odd number (e.g. 2.13) on a branch,
 *   it should remain unchanged on that branch, even if further changes are
 *   made on that branch.
 *
 * NSS_BUILTINS_LIBRARY_VERSION_MINOR is a CK_BYTE.  It's not clear
 * whether we may use its full range (0-255) or only 0-99 because
 * of the comment in the CK_VERSION type definition.
 * It's recommend to switch back to 0 after having reached version 98/99.
