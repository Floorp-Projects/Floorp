=head1 NAME

 lap - compute least annihilating power of a number

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 lap <a> <m>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<lap> program computes the order of I<a> modulo I<m>, for
arbitrary precision integers I<a> and I<m>.  The B<order> of I<a>
modulo I<m> is defined as the smallest positive value I<n> for which
I<a> raised to the I<n>th power, modulo I<m>, is equal to 1.  The
order may not exist, if I<m> is composite.

=head1 RESTRICTIONS

This program is very slow, especially for large moduli.  It is
intended as a way to help find primitive elements in a modular field,
but it does not do so in a particularly inefficient manner.  It was
written simply to help verify that a particular candidate does not
have an obviously short cycle mod I<m>.
