These sample programs can be built in either of two ways:
1) is the NSS source tree, using the coreconf build system, and 
2) stand alone (as part of the NSS distribution).

The following makefiles are used only when building in the NSS source tree
using coreconf.  These are NOT part of the distribution.

Makefile
client.mn
server.mn
config.mk
make.client
make.server

The following makefiles are used only when building in the NSS distribution.
These files are part of the distribution.

Makefile.NSS
nmakefile95.nss
nmakefilent.nss


The following source files are common to both build environments and are
part of the distribution.

NSPRerrs.h
SECerrs.h
SSLerrs.h
client.c
getopt.c
server.c
sslerror.h

In the NSS 2.0 distribution, the sample code and makefiles are in a 
directory named "samples".  The directories relevant to building 
in the distributed tree are:

./samples
./include/dbm
./include/nspr
./include/security
./lib
