This is a static library supposed to be mainly used by NSS internally. We use
it for testing, fuzzing, and a few new tools written in C++ that we're
experimenting with.

You might find it handy to use for your own projects but please be aware that
we will make no promises your application won't break in the future. We will
provide no support if you decide to link against it.
