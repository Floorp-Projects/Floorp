This directory contains patches that were added locally
on top of the NSS release.

bug-542832-ssl-restart-4.patch and bug-542832-ssl-restart-tstclnt-4.patch were
added so that we could test the new PSM SSL threading code (bug 674147) and
SPDY (bug 528288). These patches will be removed when the NSS 3.13.2 release
that includes them is imported into mozilla-central.
