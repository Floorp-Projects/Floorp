on top of the NSS release.

bug-834091.patch: Add SEC_PKCS7VerifyDetachedSignatureAtTime, which is needed
                  for B2G 1.0. This patch is probably going to be modified
                  before it can land in upstream NSS.
bug-832942.patch: work around an ARMv6 code generation bug in gcc 4.6.
