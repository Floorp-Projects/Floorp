/**
 * md4sum - computes the MD4 sum over the input buffer per RFC 1320
 *
 * @param input
 *        buffer containing input data
 * @param inputLen
 *        length of input buffer (number of bytes)
 * @param result
 *        16-byte buffer that will contain the MD4 sum upon return
 *
 * NOTE: MD4 is superceded by MD5.  do not use MD4 unless required by the
 * protocol you are implementing (e.g., NTLM requires MD4).
 *
 * NOTE: this interface is designed for relatively small buffers.  A streaming
 * interface would make more sense if that were a requirement.  Currently, this
 * is good enough for the applications we care about.
