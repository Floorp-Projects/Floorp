// Attempts to verify a certificate for a time a few weeks into the future in
// the hopes of avoiding mass test failures when the certificates all expire.
// If this test fails, the certificates probably need to be regenerated.
// See bug 1525191.

// If this test and only this test fails, do the following:
// 1. Create a bug for the issue in "Core :: Security: PSM".
// 2. Write a patch to temporarily disable the test.
// 3. Land the patch.
// 4. Write a patch to reenable the test but don't land it.
// 5. Needinfo the triage owner of Bugzilla's "Core :: Security: PSM" component
//    in the bug.
// 6. Patches to update certificates get created.
// 7. Test the patches with a Try push.
// 8. Land the patches on all trees whose code will still be used when the
//    certificates expire in 3 weeks.
