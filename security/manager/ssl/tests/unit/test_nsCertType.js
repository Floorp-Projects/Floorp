// While the Netscape certificate type extension is not a standard and has been
// discouraged from use for quite some time, it is still encountered. Thus, we
// handle it slightly differently from other unknown extensions.
// If it is not marked critical, we ignore it.
// If it is marked critical:
//   If the basic constraints and extended key usage extensions are also
//   present, we ignore it, because they are standardized and should convey the
//   same information.
//   Otherwise, we reject it with an error indicating an unknown critical
//   extension.
