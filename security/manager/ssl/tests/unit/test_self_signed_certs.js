// This test uses a specially-crafted NSS cert DB containing 12 self-signed certificates that all
// have the same subject and issuer distinguished name. Since they all have different keys and none
// of them are trust anchors, there are a large number of potential trust paths that could be
// explored. If our trust domain were naive enough to allow mozilla::pkix to explore them all, it
// would take a long time to perform (mozilla::pkix does have the concept of a path-building budget,
// but even on a fast computer, it takes an unacceptable amount of time to exhaust). To prevent the
// full exploration of this space, NSSCertDBTrustDomain skips searching through self-signed
// certificates that aren't trust anchors, since those would never otherwise be essential to
// complete a path (note that this is only true as long as the extensions we support are restrictive
// rather than additive).
// When we try to verify one of these certificates in this test, we should finish relatively
// quickly, even on slow hardware.
// Should these certificates ever need regenerating, they were produced with the following commands:
// certutil -N -d . --empty-password
// for num in 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11; do
//   echo -ne "5\n6\n9\ny\ny\n\ny\n" | certutil -d . -S -s "CN=self-signed cert" -t ,, \
//   -q secp256r1 -x -k ec -z <(date +%s) -1 -2 -n cert$num; sleep 2;
// done
