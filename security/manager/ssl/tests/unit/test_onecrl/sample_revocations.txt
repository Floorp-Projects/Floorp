# a sample revocations.txt for tests
# Lines starting with '#' are ignored - as are empty lines like this:

# otherwise:
# non-empty lines are treated as base-64 encoded DER DN data (e.g. issuer or
# subject)
# ...unless the line starts with a ' ' (space) character, in which case it's
# assumed to be base-64 encoded DER serial data, or
# the line starts with a '\t' (tab) character, in which case it's assumed to
# be a base-64 encoded SHA256 hash of a public key

# First a serial with no issuer to ensure this doesn't cause parsing to fail
# (there should be an issuer first, but we need to test this won't fail)
 dGVzdA==
# next, let's ensure data that isn't valid base64 doesn't cause breakage.
 this serial isn't valid base64 (but then there's no issuer anyway)
Neither is this issuer, though the serial is fine

 in this case, issuer is fine but not the serial
# Next two entries; we can add valid base-64 encoded data for some basic tests:
# issuer is the base-64 encoded subject DN for the shared Test CA
# serial is the base-64 encoded integer 42
