/**
 * DataStorage is a threadsafe, generic, narrow string-based hash map that
 * persists data on disk and additionally handles temporary and private data.
 * However, if used in a context where there is no profile directory, data
 * will not be persisted.
 *
 * Its lifecycle is as follows:
 * - Allocate with a filename (this is or will eventually be a file in the
 *   profile directory, if the profile exists).
 * - Call Init() from the main thread. This spins off an asynchronous read
 *   of the backing file.
 * - Eventually observers of the topic "data-storage-ready" will be notified
 *   with the backing filename as the data in the notification when this
 *   has completed.
 * - Should the profile directory not be available, (e.g. in xpcshell),
 *   DataStorage will not initially read any persistent data. The
 *   "data-storage-ready" event will still be emitted. This follows semantics
 *   similar to the permission manager and allows tests that test unrelated
 *   components to proceed without a profile.
 * - A timer periodically fires on a background thread that checks if any
 *   persistent data has changed, and if so writes all persistent data to the
 *   backing file. When this happens, observers will be notified with the
 *   topic "data-storage-written" and the backing filename as the data.
 *   It is possible to receive a "data-storage-written" event while there exist
 *   pending persistent data changes. However, those changes will eventually be
 *   written when the timer fires again, and eventually another
 *   "data-storage-written" event will be sent.
 * - When a DataStorage instance observes the topic "profile-before-change" in
 *   anticipation of shutdown, all persistent data for that DataStorage is
 *   written to the backing file (this blocks the main thread). In the process
 *   of doing this, the background serial event target responsible for these
 *   writes is then shut down to prevent further writes to that file (the
 *   background timer is also cancelled when this happens).
 *   If "profile-before-change" is not observed, this happens upon observing
 *   "xpcom-shutdown-threads".
 * - For testing purposes, the preference "test.datastorage.write_timer_ms" can
 *   be set to cause the asynchronous writing of data to happen more quickly.
 * - To prevent unbounded memory and disk use, the number of entries in each
 *   table is limited to 1024. Evictions are handled in by a modified LRU scheme
 *   (see implementation comments).
 * - NB: Instances of DataStorage have long lifetimes because they are strong
 *   observers of events and won't go away until the observer service does.
 *
 * For each key/value:
 * - The key must be a non-empty string containing no instances of '\t' or '\n'
 *   (this is a limitation of how the data is stored and will be addressed in
 *   the future).
 * - The key must have a length no more than 256.
 * - The value must not contain '\n' and must have a length no more than 1024.
 *   (the length limits are to prevent unbounded disk and memory usage)
