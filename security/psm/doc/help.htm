Internet Security Issues</FONT></b></p><A NAME="1025374">
Communication over the Internet uses the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). TCP/IP allows information to be sent from one computer to another through a variety of intermediate computers and separate networks before it reaches its destination. </P></A>
<A NAME="1025375">
The great flexibility of TCP/IP has led to its worldwide acceptance as the basic Internet communications protocol. At the same time, the fact that TCP/IP allows information to pass through intermediate computers makes it possible for people to interfere with your communications in the following ways:</P></A>
<ul><P><A NAME="1025376"><LI><B>Eavesdropping.</B> Information remains intact, but its privacy is compromised. For example, someone could learn your credit card number, record a sensitive conversation, or intercept classified information.   </LI></A><P><A NAME="1045160"><LI><B>Tampering.</B> Information in transit is changed or replaced and then sent on to the recipient. For example, someone could alter an order for goods or change a person's resume.</LI></A><P><A NAME="1045185"><LI><B>Misrepresentation.</B> Information passes to someone who poses as the intended recipient. For example, a person can pretend to have the email address <FONT FACE="courier, courier new, monospace">jdoe@mozilla.com</FONT>; a computer can identify itself as a site called <FONT FACE="courier, courier new, monospace">www.mozilla.com</FONT> when it is not; or the web site <FONT FACE="courier, courier new, monospace">www.mozilla.com</FONT> can represent itself as a furniture store when it is really just a site that collects credit card payments and never ships anything.</LI></A></ul><A NAME="1045186">
Normally, users of the many cooperating computers that make up the Internet and other networks don't monitor or interfere with the network traffic that continuously passes through their machines. However, many sensitive personal and business communications over the Internet require precautions that address the threats listed above. Fortunately, a set of well-established techniques and standards known as <a href="glossary.htm#1019178">public-key cryptography</a> makes it relatively easy to take such precautions. </P></A>
<A NAME="1025382">
Public-key cryptography and related techniques make the following precautionary measures possible:</P></A>
<ul><P><A NAME="1025383"><LI><B>Encryption and decryption</B> allow two communicating parties to disguise information they send to each other. The sender encrypts, or scrambles, information before sending it. The receiver decrypts, or unscrambles, the information after receiving it. While in transit, the encrypted information is unintelligible to an intruder.</LI></A><P><A NAME="1025384"><LI><B>Tamper detection</B> allows the recipient of information to detect whether it has been modified in transit.</LI></A><P><A NAME="1025385"><LI><B>Authentication</B> allows the recipient of information to determine the sender's identity.</LI></A><P><A NAME="1025386"><LI><B>Nonrepudiation</B> makes it very difficult for a sender of information to deny at a later date that he or she sent it.</LI></A></ul><A NAME="1044834">
The sections that follow introduce the concepts of public-key cryptography that underlie these capabilities.</P></A>
<A NAME="Encryption and Decryption"></A><A NAME="1044836">&nbsp</A>
<p><b><FONT Face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">
 
Encryption and Decryption</FONT></b></p><A NAME="1025390">
Encryption is the process of scrambling information so it is unintelligible to anyone but the intended recipient. Decryption is the process of unscrambling encrypted information so that it is intelligible again. A cryptographic algorithm, also called a cipher, is a set of rules or directions used to encrypt or decrypt data. In most cases, two related algorithms are employed, one for encryption and the other for decryption.</P></A>
<A NAME="1025391">
With most modern cryptography, the ability to keep encrypted information secret is based not on the cryptographic algorithm, which is widely known, but on a number called a key that must be used with the algorithm to produce an encrypted result or to decrypt previously encrypted information. Decryption with the correct key is simple. Decryption without the correct key is very difficult, and in some cases impossible for all practical purposes. </P></A>
<A NAME="1032495">
In general, the strength of encryption is related to the difficulty of discovering the key, which in turn depends on both the cipher used and the length of the key. For example, the difficulty of discovering the private key for the RSA cipher typically used for public-key encryption (described in the next section) depends on the difficulty of factoring large numbers, a well-known mathematical problem.</P></A>

<p><b><FONT Face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">
 
Public-Key Cryptography</FONT></b></p><A NAME="1025394">
Public-key cryptography is a set of well-established techniques and standards that allow a person or other entity to verify its identity electronically and to encrypt and decrypt electronic data. It involves a pair of keys&#151;a public key and a private key&#151;associated with that identity. The most commonly used implementations of public-key cryptography are based on algorithms patented by <a href="http://www.rsa.com/" TARGET="_blank">RSA Data Security</a>. The examples used here describe the RSA approach. </P></A>
<A NAME="1025397">
Each public key is published, and the corresponding private key is kept secret. Data encrypted with your public key can be decrypted only with your private key. <a href="help.htm#1025405">Figure 1</a> shows a simplified view of the way public-key encryption works. </P></A>
<A NAME="1025405">
<P><B>Figure 1&nbsp&nbsp Public-key encryption <p><img src="06pcrypt.gif">
</B></P>
</A><A NAME="1025409">
For example, you can freely distribute your public key, but only your private key can decrypt data encrypted using your public key. To send encrypted data, you encrypt the data with that person's public key, and the person receiving the encrypted data decrypts it with the corresponding private key. </P></A>
<A NAME="1025413">
As it happens, the reverse of the scheme shown in <a href="help.htm#1025405">Figure 1</a> also works: data encrypted with your private key can be decrypted only with your public key. This would not be a desirable way to encrypt sensitive data, however, because it means that anyone with your public key, which is by definition published, could decrypt the data. Nevertheless, private-key encryption is useful, because it means you can use your private key to sign data with your digital signature&#151;an important requirement for electronic commerce and other commercial applications of cryptography. Browser or email software can then use your public key to confirm that the data was signed with your private key and that it hasn't been tampered with since being signed. </P></A>
<A NAME="Digital Signatures"></A><A NAME="1025415">&nbsp</A>
<p><b><FONT Face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">
 
Digital Signatures</FONT></b></p><A NAME="1025416">
Encryption and decryption address the problem of eavesdropping, one of the three Internet security issues mentioned at the beginning of this section. But encryption and decryption, by themselves, do not address the other two problems mentioned in <a href="help.htm#1025373">Internet Security Issues</a>: tampering and misrepresentation. </P></A>
<A NAME="1032581">
This section describes how public-key cryptography addresses the problem of tampering. The section that follows describes how public-key cryptography addresses the problem of misrepresentation. </P></A>
<A NAME="1032582">
Tamper detection and related authentication techniques involve a special code called a <I>digital signature.</I> A digital signature is derived from both the data to be signed and the private key of the signer, and is unique (for all practical purposes) for each new piece of data that is signed. A digital signature has nothing to do with a handwritten signature, although it can sometimes be used for similar legal purposes.</P></A>
<A NAME="1025421">
Digital signatures make use of a mathematical function called a one-way hash (also called a message digest). A <I>one-way hash function</I> produces a number called a <I>one-way hash</I> that has the following characteristics:</P></A>
<ul><P><A NAME="1025422"><LI>The one-way hash is unique to the hashed data. Any change in the data, even deleting or altering a single character, results in a different value.</LI></A><P><A NAME="1025423"><LI>The content of the hashed data cannot, for all practical purposes, be deduced from the hash value&#151;which is why it is called "one-way."</LI></A></ul><A NAME="1025427">
As mentioned in <a href="help.htm#1025393">Public-Key Cryptography</a>, it's possible to use your private key for encryption and your public key for decryption. Although this is not desirable when you are encrypting sensitive information, it is a crucial part of digitally signing any data. Instead of encrypting the data itself, the signing software (such as Personal Security Manager) creates a one-way hash of the data, then uses your private key to encrypt the hash. The encrypted hash, along with other information, such as the name of the hashing algorithm, is known as a digital signature. </P></A>
<A NAME="1025431">
<a href="help.htm#1025436">Figure 2</a> shows a simplified view of the way a digital signature can be used to validate the integrity of signed data.</P></A>
<A NAME="1025436">
<P><B>Figure 2&nbsp&nbsp Using a digital signature to validate data integrity<p><img src="04digsgn.gif">
</B></P>
</A><A NAME="1025440">
<a href="help.htm#1025436">Figure 2</a> shows two items that are transferred to the recipient of some signed data: the original data and the digital signature. To create the digital signature, the sending software first creates a one-way hash of the original data, then encrypts the hash with the signer's private key.</P></A>
<A NAME="1032547">
To validate the integrity of the data, the receiving software first uses the signer's public key to decrypt the original one-way hash. The receiving software then uses the same hashing algorithm that generated the original hash to generate a new hash of the data that it has received. (Information about the hashing algorithm used is sent with the digital signature, although this isn't shown in the figure.) Finally, the receiving software compares the new hash against the original hash. If the two hashes match, the data has not changed since it was signed. If they don't match, the data may have been tampered with since it was signed, or the signature may have been created with a private key that doesn't correspond to the public key presented by the signer.</P></A>
<A NAME="1025441">
If the two hashes match, the recipient can be certain that the public key used to decrypt the digital signature corresponds to the private key used to create the digital signature. Confirming the identity of the signer, however, also requires some way of confirming that the public key really belongs to a particular person or other entity. Digital IDs called certificates, which are described in the next section, address this issue.</P></A>
<A NAME="1025442">
The significance of a digital signature is comparable to the significance of a handwritten signature. Once you have digitally signed some data, it is difficult to deny doing so later&#151;assuming that the private key has not been compromised or out of the owner's control. This quality of digital signatures provides a high degree of nonrepudiation&#151;that is, digital signatures make it difficult for the signer to deny having signed the data. In some situations, a digital signature may be as legally binding as a handwritten signature.</P></A>
<A NAME="Certificates"></A><A NAME="1025444">&nbsp</A>
<p><b><FONT Face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">
 
Certificates</FONT></b></p><A NAME="1025445">
A certificate is an electronic document used to identify an individual, a server, a company, or some other entity and to associate that identity with a public key. Like a driver's license, a credit card, a passport, or other commonly used personal IDs, a certificate provides generally recognized proof of a person's identity. Public-key cryptography uses certificates to address the problem of misrepresentation (see <a href="help.htm#1025373">Internet Security Issues</a>).</P></A>
<A NAME="1025449">
To get a driver's license, you typically apply to a government agency, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles, which verifies your identity, your ability to drive, your address, and other information before issuing the license. To get a credit card, you apply to a company that performs a credit check before issuing the ID. To get a library card, you may need to provide only your name and a utility bill with your address on it.</P></A>
<A NAME="1025450">
Certificates work much the same way as any of these familiar forms of identification. Certificate authorities (CAs) validate identities and issue certificates. They can be either independent third parties or organizations running their own certificate-issuing server software (such as Personal Security Manager). The methods used to validate an identity vary depending on the policies of a given CA&#151;just as the methods to validate other forms of identification vary depending on who is issuing the ID and the purpose for which it will be used. In general, before issuing a certificate, the CA must use published verification procedures to ensure that people or other entities requesting certificates are in fact who they claim to be. </P></A>
<A NAME="1025454">
The certificate issued by a CA binds a particular public key to the name of the person or other entity the certificate identifies (such as the name of an employee). Certificates help prevent the use of fake public keys for impersonation. Only the public key certified by the certificate will work with the corresponding private key possessed by the person or other entity identified by the certificate. </P></A>
<A NAME="1025455">
In addition to a public key, a certificate always includes the name of the person or other entity it identifies, an expiration date, the name of the CA that issued the certificate, a serial number, and other information. Most importantly, a certificate always includes the digital signature of the issuing CA. The CA's digital signature allows the certificate to function as a "letter of introduction" for users who know and trust the CA but don't know the person or other entity identified by the certificate.</P></A>

Choose a Personal Security Password</FONT></b></p><A NAME="1055635">
Your Personal Security Password protects keys associated with your identity, such as the key that protects your stored passwords or a private key associated with a certificate. These keys are stored on a <a href="glossary.htm#1028962">security device</a>, such as the default device maintained internally by Personal Security Manager (called PSM Private Keys security device) or an external <a href="glossary.htm#1027625">smart card</a>. </P></A>
<A NAME="1055831">
The Personal Security Password for the default PSM Private Keys security device also protects your master key, which is a special key used by Personal Security Manager to encrypt information on behalf of other applications. For example, Netscape 6 uses Personal Security Manager and your master key to encrypt email passwords, web site passwords, and other stored sensitive information.</P></A>
<A NAME="1055833">
If someone uses your computer who knows or can guess the Personal Security Password for any security device available to Personal Security Manager, that person may be able to email or access web sites while pretending to be you. This can be dangerous&#151;for example, if you digitally sign important email messages or manage your financial accounts over the Internet. Therefore, it's important to select a Personal Security Password that is difficult to guess. For help creating a password that's hard to guess, see <a href="help.htm#1035146">Choose a Good Password</a>.</P></A>
<A NAME="1056050">
It's also important to record your Personal Security Password in a safe place&#151;and<I> not </I>anywhere that's easily accessible to someone else. If you forget this password, you may not be able to access important information, such as web sites that require passwords or certificates or encrypted mail stored on your computer.

Modules</FONT></h2>
<A NAME="1048962">
A Public Key Cryptography Standard (PKCS) #11 module (sometimes called a <I>security module</I>) is a program that works with Personal Security Manager to manage cryptographic services such as encryption and decryption. PKCS #11 modules control security devices that can be implemented in either hardware or software.</P></A>
<A NAME="1048967">
A PKCS #11 module controls one or more security devices (sometimes called <I>tokens</I>) in much the same way that a software driver controls an external device such as a printer or modem. A security device, which can be implemented in software or hardware, provides cryptographic services such as encryption and decryption and optionally stores certificates and keys. Personal Security Manager contains its own internal software security devices. A smart card is one example of an external hardware security device. Each security device is protected by its own <a href="glossary.htm#1032744">Personal Security Password</a>. </P></A>
<A NAME="1040800">
Personal Security Manager provides a built-in PKCS #11 module that controls the internal Personal Security Manager security devices. You may install additional modules on your computer to control smart cards or other external security devices. </P></A>
<A NAME="1052615">
The Modules panel allows you to add to or delete modules from the list of PKCS #11 modules recognized by Personal Security Manager and to manage the security devices controlled by each module. </P></A>
<A NAME="1040804">
Before you can add a PKCS #11 module to the list shown in the Modules panel, you must first install the module on your computer and if necessary connect any associated hardware (such as a smart card reader). Follow the instructions that come with the hardware.</P></A>

When a module is selected in the list of modules, its available security devices (including, for example, a smart card inserted in a smart card reader) appear in the list of devices. Information about the selected module appears below the module list. Information about the selected security device appears below the security device list. Personal Security Manager must be logged into a security device before using it to provide cryptographic services.</P></A>
<A NAME="1040899">
The buttons under the list of security devices allow you to perform the following actions:</P></A>
<ul><P><A NAME="1040833"><LI>To log into a security device, select the device's module from the list of modules, then select the device name from the list of security devices and click Login. </LI></A><P><A NAME="1040907"><LI>To log out of an active security device, select the device name and click Logout. </LI></A><P><A NAME="1040912"><LI>To log out of all security devices at once, click Logout All. </LI></A></ul><A NAME="1040935">

In this case, you must choose the name of the smart card from the menu to be able to use it with Personal Security Manager.</P></A>
<A NAME="1039188">
Personal Security Manager also supplies its own default, built-in security device, which can always be used no matter what additional devices are or aren't available.</P></A>

Enrollment Information</FONT></h2>
<A NAME="1041177">
The following windows may appear while you are attempting to obtain a certificate from a certificate authority (a process sometimes called <I>certificate</I> <I>enrollment</I>): </P></A>
<ul><A NAME="1041180"><LI><a href="help.htm#1036310">Encryption Key Copy</a></LI></A><BR><A NAME="1041191"><LI><a href="help.htm#1036319">Security Certificate Backup</a></LI></A><BR></ul><A NAME="Encryption Key Copy"></A><A NAME="1036310">&nbsp</A>
<p><b><FONT Face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">
 
Encryption Key Copy</FONT></b></p><A NAME="1036317">
Certificate authorities (CAs) that issue separate signing and encryption email certificates typically make backup copies of your private encryption key during the certificate enrollment process. Separate signing and encryption certificates require client software that supports <a href="glossary.htm#1020489">dual key pairs</a> for use in signing and encrypting email.</P></A>
<A NAME="1039231">
It's important to understand that a CA that has archived a backup copy of your encryption key has the potential capability of decrypting any messages encrypted with your public key. If you trust your CA with this capability, click OK. After your CA makes a backup copy of the encryption key, you will be able to use that key to access your encrypted mail even if you lose your password or lose your own copy of the key. If no backup copy of your encryption key exists and you lose your password or the key, you will have no way of reading any of your encrypted email messages.</P></A>
<A NAME="1036318">
If you don't trust the CA that is requesting the backup copy, don't request a certificate from it. Click Cancel to stop both the backup procedure and the request for a certificate.</P></A>
<A NAME="1039243">
If you are not sure whether to trust the CA that is requesting the backup copy, talk to your system administrator.</P></A>
<A NAME="Security Certificate Backup"></A><A NAME="1036319">&nbsp</A>
<p><b><FONT Face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">
 
Security Certificate Backup</FONT></b></p><A NAME="1036327">
When you receive a certificate, make a backup copy of the certificate and its private key, then store the copy in a safe place. For example, you can put the copy on a floppy disk and store it with other valuable items under lock and key. That way, even if you have hard disk or file corruption problems, you can easily restore the certificate.</P></A>
<A NAME="1039285">
It can be inconvenient, at best, and in some situations catastrophic to lose your certificate and its associated private key, depending on what you use it for. For example:</P></A>
<ul><P><A NAME="1039517"><LI>If you lose a certificate that identifies you to important web sites, you will not be able to access those web sites until you obtain a new certificate. </LI></A><P><A NAME="1052738"><LI>If you lose a certificate used to encrypt email messages, you will not be able to read any of your encrypted email&#151;including both encrypted messages that you have sent and encrypted messages that you have received. In this case, if you cannot obtain a backup of the private encryption key associated with the certificate, you will never be able to read any of the messages encrypted with that key.</LI></A></ul><A NAME="1039286">
Like any other valuable data, certificates should be backed up to avoid future trouble and expense. Do it now so you don't forget.</P></A>

User Identification Request</FONT></b></p><A NAME="1039320">
Some web sites require that you identify yourself with a certificate rather than a name and password, because certificates provide a more reliable form of identification. However, Personal Security Manager may have more than one certificate that can be used for the purposes of identifying yourself to a web site. In this case, Personal Security Manager presents the User Identification Request window, which allows you to select the appropriate certificate for the web site you want to visit.</P></A>

<A NAME="1052794">
Your certificate store includes certificates that identify a <a href="glossary.htm#1020903">certificate authority (CA)</a>. To recognize other people's certificates, your <a href="glossary.htm#1023462">certificate store</a> must include certificates for the CAs that issued or authorized issuance of those certificates. When you decide to trust a CA, Personal Security Manager adds its certificate to your certificate store and recognizes the kinds of certificates you trust it to issue.</P></A>

Personal Security Manager displays two windows that allow you to specify that you trust a new CA:</P></A>
<ul><P><A NAME="1039980"><LI><B>New Certificate Authority: Step 1.</B> Before you decide to trust a new CA, make sure that you know who is operating it. Make sure the CA's policies and procedures and are appropriate for the kinds of certificates it issues. For example, if the CA issues certificates identifying web sites you use for financial transactions, make sure you are comfortable with the level of assurance the CA provides.</LI></A><P><A NAME="1039965"><LI><B>New Certificate Authority: Step 2.</B> At this stage, you need to decide what kinds of certificates issued by this CA you want to trust. You can select any of the following options:</LI></A><ul>
<P><A NAME="1040097"><LI><B>Trust this CA to identify web sites. </B>As noted above, web site certificates for some sites, such as those that handle financial transactions, can be extremely important, and inappropriate or false identification can have negative consequences.</LI></A><P><A NAME="1040098"><LI><B>Trust this CA to identify email users. </B>If you intend to send email users confidential information in encrypted form, or if accurate identification of email users is important to you for any other reason, you should consider carefully the CA's procedures for identifying prospective certificate owners and whether they are appropriate for your purposes before selecting this option.</LI></A><P><A NAME="1052784"><LI><B>Trust this CA to identify software developers.</B> Selecting this option means that you trust the CA to issue certificates that identify the origin of Java applets and JavaScript scripts requesting special access to your computer, such as the ability to change files. Since such access privileges can be misused, for example to destroy data stored on your hard disk, be very careful about selecting this option unless you are certain that you trust the CA for this purpose.</LI></A></ul>
