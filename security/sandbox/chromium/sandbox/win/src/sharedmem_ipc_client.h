// IPC transport implementation that uses shared memory.
// This is the client side
//
// The shared memory is divided on blocks called channels, and potentially
// it can perform as many concurrent IPC calls as channels. The IPC over
// each channel is strictly synchronous for the client.
//
// Each channel as a channel control section associated with. Each control
// section has two kernel events (known as ping and pong) and a integer
// variable that maintains a state
//
// this is the state diagram of a channel:
//
//                   locked                in service
//     kFreeChannel---------->BusyChannel-------------->kAckChannel
//          ^                                                 |
//          |_________________________________________________|
//                             answer ready
//
// The protocol is as follows:
//   1) client finds a free channel: state = kFreeChannel
//   2) does an atomic compare-and-swap, now state = BusyChannel
//   3) client writes the data into the channel buffer
//   4) client signals the ping event and waits (blocks) on the pong event
//   5) eventually the server signals the pong event
//   6) the client awakes and reads the answer from the same channel
//   7) the client updates its InOut parameters with the new data from the
//      shared memory section.
//   8) the client atomically sets the state = kFreeChannel
//
//  In the shared memory the layout is as follows:
//
//    [ channel count    ]
//    [ channel control 0]
//    [ channel control 1]
//    [ channel control N]
//    [ channel buffer 0 ] 1024 bytes
//    [ channel buffer 1 ] 1024 bytes
//    [ channel buffer N ] 1024 bytes
//
// By default each channel buffer is 1024 bytes
