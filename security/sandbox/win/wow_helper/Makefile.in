# We need to build a 64-bits binary during a 32-bits build. This requires

# which returns a msys path, while we need a windows path. So force msys
# to do the conversion for us by calling python with an environment variable
# with the result of the call to `which`. Then munge that path to add the
# x64 cross-compiler path.
