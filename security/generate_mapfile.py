# This script processes NSS .def files according to the rules defined in
# a comment at the top of each one. The files are used to define the
# exports from NSS shared libraries, with -DEFFILE on Windows, a linker
# script on Linux, or with -exported_symbols_list on OS X.
#
# The NSS build system processes them using a series of sed replacements,
# but the Mozilla build system is already running a Python script to generate
# the file so it's simpler to just do the replacement in Python.
#
# One difference between the NSS build system and Mozilla's is that
# Mozilla's supports building on Linux for Windows using MinGW. MinGW
# expects all lines containing ;+ removed and all ;- tokens removed.
