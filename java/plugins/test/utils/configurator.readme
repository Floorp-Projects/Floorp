	suite must be used.

		and inserts Key values into the key names fields
		as it describes in the template section.

		signs as following to insert the key values 
		into the text. Here comes the example.

		- Example 1

		See some text is goes and Oo-<here>-oO we will insert
		the "here" key value, that goes from the input file

		file like this :
