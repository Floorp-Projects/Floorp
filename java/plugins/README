How To Build:

*  make sure the environment var JDKHOME is set to your jdk installation
   directory, ie SET JDKHOME=C:\jdk1.2

* if you do not have working OJI set OJI_DISABLE to 1
  (You can do it in your command prompt, or you can set it in 
   mozilla/java/plugins/src/makefile.win).

* type "nmake /f makefile.win"

How to Run:

* Add following directories to to your path:
  %MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME%
  In case OJI_DISABLE add %JDKHOME%\jre\bin\classic to your path

* Copy class files from mozilla/dist/classes to your JRE/lib/ext directory and
add JRE/lib/ext to your classpath
 
How to build and run test
* go to the test directory and type "nmake /f makefile.win"
