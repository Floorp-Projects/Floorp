<p>The Webclient public API.</p>

<p>The first Webclient public API call in the application must be {@link
org.mozilla.webclient.BrowserControlFactory#setAppData}.  If embedding a
native browser, the argument must be the fully qualified path name of
the binary directory for the browser.  If embedding a non-native
browser, <code>null</code> must be passed to this method.  This method
must be called once and only once.</p>

<p>For browsers that support the concept of "profiles" it must be
possible to set the current profile used for this browsing session by
calling {@link org.mozilla.webclient.BrowserControlFactory#setProfile}.
This call must be made before the first <code>BrowserControl</code>
instance is created.  If not specified, the "<code>webclient</code>"
profile is used to avoid overwriting any settings in the user's
profile.</p>

<p>Upon from return from
<code>BrowserControlFactory.setAppData()</code>, {@link
org.mozilla.webclient.BrowserControlFactory#newBrowserControl} may be
used to create one or more web browser instances.  The returned {@link
org.mozilla.webclient.BrowserControl} may then be queried, via {@link
org.mozilla.webclient.BrowserControl#queryInterface} for additional
features.</p>

<p>When the application is done with a <code>BrowserControl</code>
instance, it must pass the instance to {@link
org.mozilla.webclient.BrowserControlFactory#deleteBrowserControl}.</p>

<p>When the application no longer needs the Webclient API, it must call
{@link
org.mozilla.webclient.BrowserControlFactory#appTerminate}.</p>
