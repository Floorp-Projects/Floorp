/*
nsIWindowWatcher is the keeper of Gecko/DOM Windows. It maintains
maintains a traversable list of open top-level windows, and allows
some operations on them.

Usage notes:

  This component has an |activeWindow| property. Clients may expect
this property to be always current, so to properly integrate this component
the application will need to keep it current by setting the property
as the active window changes.
  This component does automatically keep an accurate list of extant
windows; windows need not be added or removed by hand (and there's no
interface for doing so).
  Windows referenced will not be refcounted; the implementation will
claim no ownership. Since it's the nature of this service to always
hold a ("weak") reference to an open window, this requirement removes
a potential reference loop.  It should be safe because it's a
design requirement that clients explicitly maintain |activeWindow|,
and that windows remove themselves from the service when they are closed.
