/* nsIProgressDialog
 *
 * These objects are used to display progress notifications to the user.
 * They are displayed while files are being saved to disk, for example.
 * 
 * Typical usage is to:
 *   1. Create an instance, via the component manager CreateInstance()
 *      method.
 *   2. Set appropriate attributes that control the display and behavior
 *      of the dialog.
 *   3. Open the dialog.
 *   4. Send progress notifications to the dialog, via it's 
 *      nsIWebProgressListener methods.
 *   5. Close the dialog when the operation completes, or when the user
 *      closes it manually.
 *   6. Release the instance.  The instance will be referenced by
 *      the dialog itself, so it won't get freed until the dialog closes.
 *      The dialog will keep the instance alive, so typically one does
 *      not need to hold a reference to it.
