This is the SQLite amalgamation.
Check sqlite3.h for the version number and source id.

See http://www.sqlite.org/ for more info.

We have a mozilla-specific moz.build in src/ (normally no
moz.build there) that we use to build.

To move to a new version:

Copy the sqlite3.h and sqlite3.c files from the amalgamation of sqlite.

Be sure to update SQLITE_VERSION accordingly in $(topsrcdir)/configure.in.
