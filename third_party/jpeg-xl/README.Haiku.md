## Disclaimer

Haiku builds are not officially supported, i.e. the build might not work at all,
some tests may fail and some sub-projects are excluded from build.

This manual outlines Haiku-specific setup. For general building and testing
instructions see "[README](README.md)" and
"[Building and Testing changes](doc/building_and_testing.md)".
