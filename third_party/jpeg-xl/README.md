This repository contains a reference implementation of JPEG XL (encoder and
decoder), called `libjxl`. This software library is
[used by many applications that support JPEG XL](doc/software_support.md).

JPEG XL is in the final stages of standardization and its codestream and file format
are frozen.

The library API, command line options, and tools in this repository are subject
to change, however files encoded with `cjxl` conform to the JPEG XL format
specification and can be decoded with current and future `djxl` decoders or
`libjxl` decoding library.

## Quick start guide

For more details and other workflows see the "Advanced guide" below.

### Checking out the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl.git --recursive
```

This repository uses git submodules to handle some third party dependencies
under `third_party`, that's why is important to pass `--recursive`. If you
didn't check out with `--recursive`, or any submodule has changed, run:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Important: If you downloaded a zip file or tarball from the web interface you
won't get the needed submodules and the code will not compile. You can download
these external dependencies from source running `./deps.sh`. The git workflow
described above is recommended instead.

### Installing dependencies

Required dependencies for compiling the code, in a Debian/Ubuntu based
distribution run:

```bash
sudo apt install cmake pkg-config libbrotli-dev
```

Optional dependencies for supporting other formats in the `cjxl`/`djxl` tools,
in a Debian/Ubuntu based distribution run:

```bash
sudo apt install libgif-dev libjpeg-dev libopenexr-dev libpng-dev libwebp-dev
```

We recommend using a recent Clang compiler (version 7 or newer), for that
install clang and set `CC` and `CXX` variables.

```bash
sudo apt install clang
export CC=clang CXX=clang++
```

### Building

```bash
cd libjxl
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF ..
cmake --build . -- -j$(nproc)
```

The encoder/decoder tools will be available in the `build/tools` directory.

### <a name="installing"></a> Installing

```bash
sudo cmake --install .
```

### Basic encoder/decoder

To encode a source image to JPEG XL with default settings:

```bash
build/tools/cjxl input.png output.jxl
```

For more settings run `build/tools/cjxl --help` or for a full list of options
run `build/tools/cjxl -v -v --help`.

To decode a JPEG XL file run:

```bash
build/tools/djxl input.jxl output.png
```

When possible `cjxl`/`djxl` are able to read/write the following
image formats: .exr, .gif, .jpeg/.jpg, .pfm, .pgm/.ppm, .pgx, .png.

### Benchmarking

For speed benchmarks on single images in single or multi-threaded decoding
`djxl` can print decoding speed information. See `djxl --help` for details
on the decoding options and note that the output image is optional for
benchmarking purposes.

For more comprehensive benchmarking options, see the
[benchmarking guide](doc/benchmarking.md).

## Advanced guide

### Building with Docker

We build a common environment based on Debian/Ubuntu using Docker. Other
systems may have different combinations of versions and dependencies that
have not been tested and may not work. For those cases we recommend using the
Docker container as explained in the
[step by step guide](doc/developing_in_docker.md).

### Building JPEG XL for developers

For experienced developers, we provide build instructions for several other environments:

*   [Building on Debian](doc/developing_in_debian.md)
*   Building on Windows with [vcpkg](doc/developing_in_windows_vcpkg.md) (Visual Studio 2019)
*   Building on Windows with [MSYS2](doc/developing_in_windows_msys.md)
*   [Cross Compiling for Windows with Crossroad](doc/developing_with_crossroad.md)

If you encounter any difficulties, please use Docker instead.
