// C++ implementation using std::thread of a ::JxlParallelRunner.

// The main class in this module, ThreadParallelRunner, implements a static
// method ThreadParallelRunner::Runner than can be passed as a
// JxlParallelRunner when using the JPEG XL library. This uses std::thread
// internally and related synchronization functions. The number of threads
// created is fixed at construction time and the threads are re-used for every
// ThreadParallelRunner::Runner call. Only one concurrent Runner() call per
// instance is allowed at a time.
//
// This is a scalable, lower-overhead thread pool runner, especially suitable
// for data-parallel computations in the fork-join model, where clients need to
// know when all tasks have completed.
//
// This thread pool can efficiently load-balance millions of tasks using an
// atomic counter, thus avoiding per-task virtual or system calls. With 48
// hyperthreads and 1M tasks that add to an atomic counter, overall runtime is
// 10-20x higher when using std::async, and ~200x for a queue-based thread
// pool.
//
// Usage:
//   ThreadParallelRunner runner;
//   JxlDecode(
//       ... , &ThreadParallelRunner::Runner, static_cast<void*>(&runner));
