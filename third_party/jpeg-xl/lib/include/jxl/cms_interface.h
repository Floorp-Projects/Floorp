 * (CMSes, also called color management modules, or CMMs) in JPEG XL.
 *
 * A CMS is needed by the JPEG XL encoder and decoder to perform colorspace
 * conversions. This defines an interface that can be implemented for different
 * CMSes and then passed to the library.

 * if access to it is desired in @c run. Likewise for JxlCmsInterface::destroy.
 *
 * The ICC data in @p input and @p output is guaranteed to outlive the @c init /
 * @c run / @c destroy cycle.
 *
 * @param init_data JxlCmsInterface::init_data passed as-is.
 * @param num_threads the maximum number of threads from which
 *        JxlCmsInterface::run will be called.
 * @param pixels_per_thread the maximum number of pixels that each call to
 *        JxlCmsInterface::run will have to transform.
 * @param input_profile the input colorspace for the transform.
 * @param output_profile the colorspace to which JxlCmsInterface::run should
 *        convert the input data.
 * @param intensity_target for colorspaces where luminance is relative
 *        (essentially: not PQ), indicates the luminance at which (1, 1, 1) will
 *        be displayed. This is useful for conversions between PQ and a relative
 *        luminance colorspace, in either direction: @p intensity_target cd/m²
 *        in PQ should map to and from (1, 1, 1) in the relative one.\n
 *        It is also used for conversions to and from HLG, as it is
 *        scene-referred while other colorspaces are assumed to be
 *        display-referred. That is, conversions from HLG should apply the OOTF
 *        for a peak display luminance of @p intensity_target, and conversions
 *        to HLG should undo it. The OOTF is a gamma function applied to the
 *        luminance channel (https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BT.2100-2-201807-I
 *        page 7), with the gamma value computed as
 *        <tt>1.2 * 1.111^log2(intensity_target / 1000)</tt> (footnote 2 page 8
 *        of the same document).
 * @return The data needed for the transform, or @c NULL in case of failure.
 *         This will be passed to the other functions as @c user_data.
