    """
    Representation of a task in a TaskGraph.  Each Task has, at creation:

    - kind: the name of the task kind
    - label; the label for this task
    - attributes: a dictionary of attributes for this task (used for filtering)
    - task: the task definition (JSON-able dictionary)
    - optimization: optimization to apply to the task (see taskgraph.optimize)
    - dependencies: tasks this one depends on, in the form {name: label}, for example
      {'build': 'build-linux64/opt', 'docker-image': 'build-docker-image-desktop-test'}
    - soft_dependencies: tasks this one may depend on if they are available post
      optimisation. They are set as a list of tasks label.

    And later, as the task-graph processing proceeds:

    - task_id -- TaskCluster taskId under which this task will be created

    This class is just a convenience wrapper for the data type and managing
    display, comparison, serialization, etc. It has no functionality of its own.
