Use this rule to control the position and formatting of comments.

.. rubric:: Options

* Use ``require-starting-space`` to require a space character right after the
  ``#``. Set to ``true`` to enable, ``false`` to disable.
* Use ``ignore-shebangs`` to ignore a
  `shebang <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)>`_ at the beginning of
  the file when ``require-starting-space`` is set.
* ``min-spaces-from-content`` is used to visually separate inline comments from
  content. It defines the minimal required number of spaces between a comment
  and its preceding content.

.. rubric:: Examples

#. With ``comments: {require-starting-space: true}``

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    # This sentence
    # is a block comment

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    ##############################
    ## This is some documentation

   the following code snippet would **FAIL**:
   ::

    #This sentence
    #is a block comment

#. With ``comments: {min-spaces-from-content: 2}``

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    x = 2 ^ 127 - 1  # Mersenne prime number

   the following code snippet would **FAIL**:
   ::

    x = 2 ^ 127 - 1 # Mersenne prime number
