Use this rule to set a maximal number of allowed consecutive blank lines.

.. rubric:: Options

* ``max`` defines the maximal number of empty lines allowed in the document.
* ``max-start`` defines the maximal number of empty lines allowed at the
  beginning of the file. This option takes precedence over ``max``.
* ``max-end`` defines the maximal number of empty lines allowed at the end of
  the file.  This option takes precedence over ``max``.

#. With ``empty-lines: {max: 1}``

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    - foo:

        - 2

    - bar: [3, 4]

   the following code snippet would **FAIL**:
