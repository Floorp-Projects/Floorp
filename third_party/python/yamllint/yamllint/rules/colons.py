Use this rule to control the number of spaces before and after colons (``:``).

.. rubric:: Options

* ``max-spaces-before`` defines the maximal number of spaces allowed before
  colons (use ``-1`` to disable).
* ``max-spaces-after`` defines the maximal number of spaces allowed after
  colons (use ``-1`` to disable).

.. rubric:: Examples

#. With ``colons: {max-spaces-before: 0, max-spaces-after: 1}``

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    object:
      - a
      - b
    key: value

#. With ``colons: {max-spaces-before: 1}``

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    object :
      - a
      - b

   the following code snippet would **FAIL**:
   ::

    object  :
      - a
      - b

#. With ``colons: {max-spaces-after: 2}``

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    first:  1
    second: 2
    third:  3

   the following code snippet would **FAIL**:
   ::

    first: 1
    2nd:   2
    third: 3
