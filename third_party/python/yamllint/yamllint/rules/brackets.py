Use this rule to control the number of spaces inside brackets (``[`` and
``]``).

.. rubric:: Options

* ``min-spaces-inside`` defines the minimal number of spaces required inside
  brackets.
* ``max-spaces-inside`` defines the maximal number of spaces allowed inside
  brackets.
* ``min-spaces-inside-empty`` defines the minimal number of spaces required
  inside empty brackets.
* ``max-spaces-inside-empty`` defines the maximal number of spaces allowed
  inside empty brackets.

.. rubric:: Examples

#. With ``brackets: {min-spaces-inside: 0, max-spaces-inside: 0}``

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    object: [1, 2, abc]

   the following code snippet would **FAIL**:
   ::

    object: [ 1, 2, abc ]

#. With ``brackets: {min-spaces-inside: 1, max-spaces-inside: 3}``

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    object: [ 1, 2, abc ]

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    object: [ 1, 2, abc   ]

   the following code snippet would **FAIL**:
   ::

    object: [    1, 2, abc   ]

   the following code snippet would **FAIL**:
   ::

    object: [1, 2, abc ]

#. With ``brackets: {min-spaces-inside-empty: 0, max-spaces-inside-empty: 0}``

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    object: []

   ::

    object: [ ]

#. With ``brackets: {min-spaces-inside-empty: 1, max-spaces-inside-empty: -1}``

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
