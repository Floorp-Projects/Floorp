Use this rule to require a new line character (``\\n``) at the end of files.

The POSIX standard `requires the last line to end with a new line character
<http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_206>`_.
All UNIX tools expect a new line at the end of files. Most text editors use
