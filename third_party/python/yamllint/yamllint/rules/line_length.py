"""
Use this rule to set a limit to lines length.

Note: with Python 2, the ``line-length`` rule may not work properly with
unicode characters because of the way strings are represented in bytes. We
recommend running yamllint with Python 3.

.. rubric:: Options

* ``max`` defines the maximal (inclusive) length of lines.
* ``allow-non-breakable-words`` is used to allow non breakable words (without
  spaces inside) to overflow the limit. This is useful for long URLs, for
  instance. Use ``true`` to allow, ``false`` to forbid.
* ``allow-non-breakable-inline-mappings`` implies ``allow-non-breakable-words``
  and extends it to also allow non-breakable words in inline mappings.

.. rubric:: Examples

#. With ``line-length: {max: 70}``

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    long sentence:
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do
      eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

   the following code snippet would **FAIL**:
   ::

    long sentence:
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
      tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

#. With ``line-length: {max: 60, allow-non-breakable-words: true}``

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    this:
      is:
        - a:
            http://localhost/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/long/url

    # this comment is too long,
    # but hard to split:
    # http://localhost/another/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/long/url

   the following code snippet would **FAIL**:
   ::

    - this line is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long but could be easily split...

   and the following code snippet would also **FAIL**:
   ::

    - foobar: http://localhost/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/long/url

#. With ``line-length: {max: 60, allow-non-breakable-words: true,
   allow-non-breakable-inline-mappings: true}``

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    - foobar: http://localhost/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/long/url

#. With ``line-length: {max: 60, allow-non-breakable-words: false}``

   the following code snippet would **FAIL**:
   ::

    this:
      is:
        - a:
            http://localhost/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/long/url
