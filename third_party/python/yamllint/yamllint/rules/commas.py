Use this rule to control the number of spaces before and after commas (``,``).

.. rubric:: Options

* ``max-spaces-before`` defines the maximal number of spaces allowed before
  commas (use ``-1`` to disable).
* ``min-spaces-after`` defines the minimal number of spaces required after
  commas.
* ``max-spaces-after`` defines the maximal number of spaces allowed after
  commas (use ``-1`` to disable).

.. rubric:: Examples

#. With ``commas: {max-spaces-before: 0}``

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    strange var:
      [10, 20, 30, {x: 1, y: 2}]

   the following code snippet would **FAIL**:
   ::

    strange var:
      [10, 20 , 30, {x: 1, y: 2}]

#. With ``commas: {max-spaces-before: 2}``

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    strange var:
      [10  , 20 , 30,  {x: 1  , y: 2}]

#. With ``commas: {max-spaces-before: -1}``

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    strange var:
      [10,
       20   , 30
       ,   {x: 1, y: 2}]

#. With ``commas: {min-spaces-after: 1, max-spaces-after: 1}``
