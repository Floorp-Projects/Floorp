Description: =====
        jsmin
        =====
        
        JavaScript minifier.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        .. code:: python
        
         from jsmin import jsmin
         with open('myfile.js') as js_file:
             minified = jsmin(js_file.read())
        
        You can run it as a commandline tool also::
        
          python -m jsmin myfile.js
        
        NB: ``jsmin`` makes no attempt to be compatible with
        `ECMAScript 6 / ES.next / Harmony <http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:specification_drafts>`_.
        The current maintainer does not intend to add ES6-compatibility. If you would
        like to take over maintenance and update ``jsmin`` for ES6, please contact
        `Tikitu de Jager <mailto:tikitu+jsmin@logophile.org>`_. Pull requests are also
        welcome, of course, but my time to review them is somewhat limited these days.
        
        If you're using ``jsmin`` on ES6 code, though, you might find the ``quote_chars``
        parameter useful:
        
        .. code:: python
        
         from jsmin import jsmin
         with open('myfile.js') as js_file:
             minified = jsmin(js_file.read(), quote_chars="'\"`")
        
        
        Where to get it
        ===============
        
        * install the package `from pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jsmin/>`_
        * get the latest release `from latest-release on github <https://github.com/tikitu/jsmin/tree/latest-release/jsmin>`_
        * get the development version `from master on github <https://github.com/tikitu/jsmin/>`_
        
        
        Python 2 support removed
        ========================
        
        Python 2 support was removed in version 3.0.0. If you need to support Python 2, please use version 2.2.2 with setuptools<58.
        
        Contributing
        ============
        
        `Issues <https://github.com/tikitu/jsmin/issues>`_ and `Pull requests <https://github.com/tikitu/jsmin/pulls>`_
        will be gratefully received on Github. The project used to be hosted
        `on bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/dcs/jsmin/>`_ and old issues can still be
        found there.
        
        If possible, please make separate pull requests for tests and for code: tests will be added to the `latest-release` branch while code will go to `master`.
        
        Unless you request otherwise, your Github identity will be added to the contributor's list below; if you prefer a
        different name feel free to add it in your pull request instead. (If you prefer not to be mentioned you'll have to let
        the maintainer know somehow.)
        
        Build/test status
        =================
        
        Both branches are tested with Travis: https://travis-ci.org/tikitu/jsmin
        
        The `latest-release` branch (the version on PyPI plus any new tests) is tested against CPython 3.
        Currently:
        
        .. image:: https://travis-ci.org/tikitu/jsmin.png?branch=latest-release
        
        If that branch is failing that means there's a new test that fails on *the latest released version on pypi*, with no fix yet
        released.
        
        The `master` branch (development version, might be ahead of latest released version) is tested against CPython 3.
        Currently:
        
        .. image:: https://travis-ci.org/tikitu/jsmin.png?branch=master
        
        If `master` is failing don't use it, but as long as `latest-release` is passing the pypi release should be ok.
