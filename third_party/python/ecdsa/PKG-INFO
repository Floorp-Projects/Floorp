        This is an easy-to-use implementation of ECDSA cryptography (Elliptic Curve
        Digital Signature Algorithm), implemented purely in Python, released under
        the MIT license. With this library, you can quickly create keypairs (signing
        key and verifying key), sign messages, and verify the signatures. The keys
        and signatures are very short, making them easy to handle and incorporate
        into other protocols.
        
        ## Features
        
        This library provides key generation, signing, and verifying, for five
        popular NIST "Suite B" GF(p) (_prime field_) curves, with key lengths of 192,
        224, 256, 384, and 521 bits. The "short names" for these curves, as known by
        the OpenSSL tool (`openssl ecparam -list_curves`), are: `prime192v1`,
        `secp224r1`, `prime256v1`, `secp384r1`, and `secp521r1`. It includes the
        256-bit curve `secp256k1` used by Bitcoin. There is also support for the
        regular (non-twisted) variants of Brainpool curves from 160 to 512 bits. The
        "short names" of those curves are: `brainpoolP160r1`, `brainpoolP192r1`,
        `brainpoolP224r1`, `brainpoolP256r1`, `brainpoolP320r1`, `brainpoolP384r1`,
        `brainpoolP512r1`.
        No other curves are included, but it is not too hard to add support for more
        curves over prime fields.
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        This library uses only Python and the 'six' package. It is compatible with
        Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3+. It also supports execution on the alternative
        implementations like pypy and pypy3.
        
        If `gmpy2` or `gmpy` is installed, they will be used for faster arithmetic.
        Either of them can be installed after this library is installed,
        `python-ecdsa` will detect their presence on start-up and use them
        automatically.
        
        To run the OpenSSL compatibility tests, the 'openssl' tool must be in your
        `PATH`. This release has been tested successfully against OpenSSL 0.9.8o,
        1.0.0a, 1.0.2f and 1.1.1d (among others).
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        This library is available on PyPI, it's recommended to install it using `pip`:
        
        ```
        pip install ecdsa
        ```
        
        In case higher performance is wanted and using native code is not a problem,
        it's possible to specify installation together with `gmpy2`:
        
        ```
        pip install ecdsa[gmpy2]
        ```
        
        or (slower, legacy option):
        ```
        pip install ecdsa[gmpy]
        ```
        
        ## Speed
        
        The following table shows how long this library takes to generate keypairs
        (`keygen`), to sign data (`sign`), and to verify those signatures (`verify`).
        All those values are in seconds.
        For convenience, the inverses of those values are also provided:
        how many keys per second can be generated (`keygen/s`), how many signatures
        can be made per second (`sign/s`) and how many signatures can be verified
        per second (`verify/s`). The size of raw signature (generally the smallest
        way a signature can be encoded) is also provided in the `siglen` column.
        Use `tox -e speed` to generate this table on your own computer.
        On an Intel Core i7 4790K @ 4.0GHz I'm getting the following performance:

        For comparison, a highly optimised implementation (including curve-specific

        Run `openssl speed ecdsa` and `openssl speed ecdh` to reproduce it:

        Keys and signature can be serialized in different ways (see Usage, below).
        For a NIST192p key, the three basic representations require strings of the
        following lengths (in bytes):
        
            to_string:  signkey= 24, verifykey= 48, signature=48
            compressed: signkey=n/a, verifykey= 25, signature=n/a
            DER:        signkey=106, verifykey= 80, signature=55
            PEM:        signkey=278, verifykey=162, (no support for PEM signatures)
        
        ## History
        
        In 2006, Peter Pearson announced his pure-python implementation of ECDSA in a
        [message to sci.crypt][1], available from his [download site][2]. In 2010,
        Brian Warner wrote a wrapper around this code, to make it a bit easier and
        safer to use. Hubert Kario then included an implementation of elliptic curve
        cryptography that uses Jacobian coordinates internally, improving performance
        about 20-fold. You are looking at the README for this wrapper.
        
        [1]: http://www.derkeiler.com/Newsgroups/sci.crypt/2006-01/msg00651.html
        [2]: http://webpages.charter.net/curryfans/peter/downloads.html
        
        ## Testing
        
        To run the full test suite, do this:
        
            tox -e coverage
        
        On an Intel Core i7 4790K @ 4.0GHz, the tests take about 16 seconds to execute.
        The test suite uses
        [`hypothesis`](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis) so there is some
        inherent variability in the test suite execution time.
        
        One part of `test_pyecdsa.py` checks compatibility with OpenSSL, by
        running the "openssl" CLI tool, make sure it's in your `PATH` if you want
        to test compatibility with it.
        
        ## Security
        
        This library was not designed with security in mind. If you are processing
        data that needs to be protected we suggest you use a quality wrapper around
        OpenSSL. [pyca/cryptography](https://cryptography.io) is one example of such
        a wrapper. The primary use-case of this library is as a portable library for
        interoperability testing and as a teaching tool.
        
        **This library does not protect against side channel attacks.**
        
        Do not allow attackers to measure how long it takes you to generate a keypair
        or sign a message. Do not allow attackers to run code on the same physical
        machine when keypair generation or signing is taking place (this includes
        virtual machines). Do not allow attackers to measure how much power your
        computer uses while generating the keypair or signing a message. Do not allow
        attackers to measure RF interference coming from your computer while generating
        a keypair or signing a message. Note: just loading the private key will cause
        keypair generation. Other operations or attack vectors may also be
        vulnerable to attacks. **For a sophisticated attacker observing just one
        operation with a private key will be sufficient to completely
        reconstruct the private key**.
        
        Please also note that any Pure-python cryptographic library will be vulnerable
        to the same side channel attacks. This is because Python does not provide
        side-channel secure primitives (with the exception of
        [`hmac.compare_digest()`][3]), making side-channel secure programming
        impossible.
        
        This library depends upon a strong source of random numbers. Do not use it on
        a system where `os.urandom()` does not provide cryptographically secure
        random numbers.
        
        [3]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/hmac.html#hmac.compare_digest
        
        ## Usage
        
        You start by creating a `SigningKey`. You can use this to sign data, by passing
        in data as a byte string and getting back the signature (also a byte string).
        You can also ask a `SigningKey` to give you the corresponding `VerifyingKey`.
        The `VerifyingKey` can be used to verify a signature, by passing it both the
        data string and the signature byte string: it either returns True or raises
        `BadSignatureError`.
        
        ```python
        from ecdsa import SigningKey
        sk = SigningKey.generate() # uses NIST192p
        vk = sk.verifying_key
        signature = sk.sign(b"message")
        assert vk.verify(signature, b"message")
        ```
        
        Each `SigningKey`/`VerifyingKey` is associated with a specific curve, like
        NIST192p (the default one). Longer curves are more secure, but take longer to
        use, and result in longer keys and signatures.
        
        ```python
        from ecdsa import SigningKey, NIST384p
        sk = SigningKey.generate(curve=NIST384p)
        vk = sk.verifying_key
        signature = sk.sign(b"message")
        assert vk.verify(signature, b"message")
        ```
        
        The `SigningKey` can be serialized into several different formats: the shortest
        is to call `s=sk.to_string()`, and then re-create it with
        `SigningKey.from_string(s, curve)` . This short form does not record the
        curve, so you must be sure to pass to `from_string()` the same curve you used
        for the original key. The short form of a NIST192p-based signing key is just 24
        bytes long. If a point encoding is invalid or it does not lie on the specified
        curve, `from_string()` will raise `MalformedPointError`.
        
        ```python
        from ecdsa import SigningKey, NIST384p
        sk = SigningKey.generate(curve=NIST384p)
        sk_string = sk.to_string()
        sk2 = SigningKey.from_string(sk_string, curve=NIST384p)
        print(sk_string.hex())
        print(sk2.to_string().hex())
        ```
        
        Note: while the methods are called `to_string()` the type they return is
        actually `bytes`, the "string" part is leftover from Python 2.
        
        `sk.to_pem()` and `sk.to_der()` will serialize the signing key into the same
        formats that OpenSSL uses. The PEM file looks like the familiar ASCII-armored
        `"-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----"` base64-encoded format, and the DER format
        is a shorter binary form of the same data.
        `SigningKey.from_pem()/.from_der()` will undo this serialization. These
        formats include the curve name, so you do not need to pass in a curve
        identifier to the deserializer. In case the file is malformed `from_der()`
        and `from_pem()` will raise `UnexpectedDER` or` MalformedPointError`.
        
        ```python
        from ecdsa import SigningKey, NIST384p
        sk = SigningKey.generate(curve=NIST384p)
        sk_pem = sk.to_pem()
        sk2 = SigningKey.from_pem(sk_pem)
        # sk and sk2 are the same key
        ```
        
        Likewise, the `VerifyingKey` can be serialized in the same way:
        `vk.to_string()/VerifyingKey.from_string()`, `to_pem()/from_pem()`, and
        `to_der()/from_der()`. The same `curve=` argument is needed for
        `VerifyingKey.from_string()`.
        
        ```python
        from ecdsa import SigningKey, VerifyingKey, NIST384p
        sk = SigningKey.generate(curve=NIST384p)
        vk = sk.verifying_key
        vk_string = vk.to_string()
        vk2 = VerifyingKey.from_string(vk_string, curve=NIST384p)
        # vk and vk2 are the same key
        
        from ecdsa import SigningKey, VerifyingKey, NIST384p
        sk = SigningKey.generate(curve=NIST384p)
        vk = sk.verifying_key
        vk_pem = vk.to_pem()
        vk2 = VerifyingKey.from_pem(vk_pem)
        # vk and vk2 are the same key
        ```
        
        There are a couple of different ways to compute a signature. Fundamentally,
        ECDSA takes a number that represents the data being signed, and returns a
        pair of numbers that represent the signature. The `hashfunc=` argument to
        `sk.sign()` and `vk.verify()` is used to turn an arbitrary string into
        fixed-length digest, which is then turned into a number that ECDSA can sign,
        and both sign and verify must use the same approach. The default value is
        `hashlib.sha1`, but if you use NIST256p or a longer curve, you can use
        `hashlib.sha256` instead.
        
        There are also multiple ways to represent a signature. The default
        `sk.sign()` and `vk.verify()` methods present it as a short string, for
        simplicity and minimal overhead. To use a different scheme, use the
        `sk.sign(sigencode=)` and `vk.verify(sigdecode=)` arguments. There are helper
        functions in the `ecdsa.util` module that can be useful here.
        
        It is also possible to create a `SigningKey` from a "seed", which is
        deterministic. This can be used in protocols where you want to derive
        consistent signing keys from some other secret, for example when you want
        three separate keys and only want to store a single master secret. You should
        start with a uniformly-distributed unguessable seed with about `curve.baselen`
        bytes of entropy, and then use one of the helper functions in `ecdsa.util` to
        convert it into an integer in the correct range, and then finally pass it
        into `SigningKey.from_secret_exponent()`, like this:
        
        ```python
        import os
        from ecdsa import NIST384p, SigningKey
        from ecdsa.util import randrange_from_seed__trytryagain
        
        def make_key(seed):
          secexp = randrange_from_seed__trytryagain(seed, NIST384p.order)
          return SigningKey.from_secret_exponent(secexp, curve=NIST384p)
        
        seed = os.urandom(NIST384p.baselen) # or other starting point
        sk1a = make_key(seed)
        sk1b = make_key(seed)
        # note: sk1a and sk1b are the same key
        assert sk1a.to_string() == sk1b.to_string()
        sk2 = make_key(b"2-"+seed)  # different key
        assert sk1a.to_string() != sk2.to_string()
        ```
        
        In case the application will verify a lot of signatures made with a single
        key, it's possible to precompute some of the internal values to make
        signature verification significantly faster. The break-even point occurs at
        about 100 signatures verified.
        
        To perform precomputation, you can call the `precompute()` method
        on `VerifyingKey` instance:
        ```python
        from ecdsa import SigningKey, NIST384p
        sk = SigningKey.generate(curve=NIST384p)
        vk = sk.verifying_key
        vk.precompute()
        signature = sk.sign(b"message")
        assert vk.verify(signature, b"message")
        ```
        
        Once `precompute()` was called, all signature verifications with this key will
        be faster to execute.
        
        ## OpenSSL Compatibility
        
        To produce signatures that can be verified by OpenSSL tools, or to verify
        signatures that were produced by those tools, use:
        
        ```python
        # openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -out sk.pem
        # openssl ec -in sk.pem -pubout -out vk.pem
        # echo "data for signing" > data
        # openssl dgst -sha256 -sign sk.pem -out data.sig data
        # openssl dgst -sha256 -verify vk.pem -signature data.sig data
        # openssl dgst -sha256 -prverify sk.pem -signature data.sig data
        
        import hashlib
        from ecdsa import SigningKey, VerifyingKey
        from ecdsa.util import sigencode_der, sigdecode_der
        
        with open("vk.pem") as f:
           vk = VerifyingKey.from_pem(f.read())
        
        with open("data", "rb") as f:
           data = f.read()
        
        with open("data.sig", "rb") as f:
           signature = f.read()
        
        assert vk.verify(signature, data, hashlib.sha256, sigdecode=sigdecode_der)
        
        with open("sk.pem") as f:
           sk = SigningKey.from_pem(f.read(), hashlib.sha256)
        
        new_signature = sk.sign_deterministic(data, sigencode=sigencode_der)
        
        with open("data.sig2", "wb") as f:
           f.write(new_signature)
        
        # openssl dgst -sha256 -verify vk.pem -signature data.sig2 data
        ```
        
        Note: if compatibility with OpenSSL 1.0.0 or earlier is necessary, the
        `sigencode_string` and `sigdecode_string` from `ecdsa.util` can be used for
        respectively writing and reading the signatures.
        
        The keys also can be written in format that openssl can handle:
        
        ```python
        from ecdsa import SigningKey, VerifyingKey
        
        with open("sk.pem") as f:
            sk = SigningKey.from_pem(f.read())
        with open("sk.pem", "wb") as f:
            f.write(sk.to_pem())
        
        with open("vk.pem") as f:
            vk = VerifyingKey.from_pem(f.read())
        with open("vk.pem", "wb") as f:
            f.write(vk.to_pem())
        ```
        
        ## Entropy
        
        Creating a signing key with `SigningKey.generate()` requires some form of
        entropy (as opposed to
        `from_secret_exponent`/`from_string`/`from_der`/`from_pem`,
        which are deterministic and do not require an entropy source). The default
        source is `os.urandom()`, but you can pass any other function that behaves
        like `os.urandom` as the `entropy=` argument to do something different. This
        may be useful in unit tests, where you want to achieve repeatable results. The
        `ecdsa.util.PRNG` utility is handy here: it takes a seed and produces a strong
        pseudo-random stream from it:
        
        ```python
        from ecdsa.util import PRNG
        from ecdsa import SigningKey
        rng1 = PRNG(b"seed")
        sk1 = SigningKey.generate(entropy=rng1)
        rng2 = PRNG(b"seed")
        sk2 = SigningKey.generate(entropy=rng2)
        # sk1 and sk2 are the same key
        ```
        
        Likewise, ECDSA signature generation requires a random number, and each
        signature must use a different one (using the same number twice will
        immediately reveal the private signing key). The `sk.sign()` method takes an
        `entropy=` argument which behaves the same as `SigningKey.generate(entropy=)`.
        
        ## Deterministic Signatures
        
        If you call `SigningKey.sign_deterministic(data)` instead of `.sign(data)`,
        the code will generate a deterministic signature instead of a random one.
        This uses the algorithm from RFC6979 to safely generate a unique `k` value,
        derived from the private key and the message being signed. Each time you sign
        the same message with the same key, you will get the same signature (using
        the same `k`).
        
        This may become the default in a future version, as it is not vulnerable to
        failures of the entropy source.
        
        ## Examples
        
        Create a NIST192p keypair and immediately save both to disk:
        
        ```python
        from ecdsa import SigningKey
        sk = SigningKey.generate()
        vk = sk.verifying_key
        with open("private.pem", "wb") as f:
            f.write(sk.to_pem())
        with open("public.pem", "wb") as f:
            f.write(vk.to_pem())
        ```
        
        Load a signing key from disk, use it to sign a message (using SHA-1), and write
        the signature to disk:
        
        ```python
        from ecdsa import SigningKey
        with open("private.pem") as f:
            sk = SigningKey.from_pem(f.read())
        with open("message", "rb") as f:
            message = f.read()
        sig = sk.sign(message)
        with open("signature", "wb") as f:
            f.write(sig)
        ```
        
        Load the verifying key, message, and signature from disk, and verify the
        signature (assume SHA-1 hash):
        
        ```python
        from ecdsa import VerifyingKey, BadSignatureError
        vk = VerifyingKey.from_pem(open("public.pem").read())
        with open("message", "rb") as f:
            message = f.read()
        with open("signature", "rb") as f:
            sig = f.read()
        try:
            vk.verify(sig, message)
            print "good signature"
        except BadSignatureError:
            print "BAD SIGNATURE"
        ```
        
        Create a NIST521p keypair:
        
        ```python
        from ecdsa import SigningKey, NIST521p
        sk = SigningKey.generate(curve=NIST521p)
        vk = sk.verifying_key
        ```
        
        Create three independent signing keys from a master seed:
        
        ```python
        from ecdsa import NIST192p, SigningKey
        from ecdsa.util import randrange_from_seed__trytryagain
        
        def make_key_from_seed(seed, curve=NIST192p):
            secexp = randrange_from_seed__trytryagain(seed, curve.order)
            return SigningKey.from_secret_exponent(secexp, curve)
        
        sk1 = make_key_from_seed("1:%s" % seed)
        sk2 = make_key_from_seed("2:%s" % seed)
        sk3 = make_key_from_seed("3:%s" % seed)
        ```
        
        Load a verifying key from disk and print it using hex encoding in
        uncompressed and compressed format (defined in X9.62 and SEC1 standards):
        
        ```python
        from ecdsa import VerifyingKey
        
        with open("public.pem") as f:
            vk = VerifyingKey.from_pem(f.read())
        
        print("uncompressed: {0}".format(vk.to_string("uncompressed").hex()))
        print("compressed: {0}".format(vk.to_string("compressed").hex()))
        ```
        
        Load a verifying key from a hex string from compressed format, output
        uncompressed:
        
        ```python
        from ecdsa import VerifyingKey, NIST256p
        
        comp_str = '022799c0d0ee09772fdd337d4f28dc155581951d07082fb19a38aa396b67e77759'
        vk = VerifyingKey.from_string(bytearray.fromhex(comp_str), curve=NIST256p)
        print(vk.to_string("uncompressed").hex())
        ```
        
        ECDH key exchange with remote party
        
        ```python
        from ecdsa import ECDH, NIST256p
        
        ecdh = ECDH(curve=NIST256p)
        ecdh.generate_private_key()
        local_public_key = ecdh.get_public_key()
        #send `local_public_key` to remote party and receive `remote_public_key` from remote party
        with open("remote_public_key.pem") as e:
            remote_public_key = e.read()
        ecdh.load_received_public_key_pem(remote_public_key)
        secret = ecdh.generate_sharedsecret_bytes()
        ```
