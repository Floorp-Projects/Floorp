error[E0599]: the method `as_dyn_error` exists for reference `&NotError`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied

    |         ^^^^^^ method cannot be called on `&NotError` due to unsatisfied trait bounds

    = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
            `NotError: std::error::Error`
            which is required by `NotError: AsDynError`
            `&NotError: std::error::Error`
            which is required by `&NotError: AsDynError`
note: the following trait must be implemented
