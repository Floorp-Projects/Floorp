   = note: source type: `AlignOf<[u8; 2]>` (8 bits)
   = note: target type: `MaxAlignsOf<[u8; 2], AU16>` (16 bits)
   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::assert_align_gt_eq` which comes from the expansion of the macro `transmute_mut` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
