# TSAN suppressions file for `bytes`

# TSAN does not understand fences and `Arc::drop` is implemented using a fence.
# This causes many false positives.
race:Arc*drop
race:arc*Weak*drop

# `std` mpsc is not used in any Bytes code base. This race is triggered by some
# rust runtime logic.
race:std*mpsc_queue

# Some test runtime races. Allocation should be race free
race:alloc::alloc

# Not sure why this is warning, but it is in the test harness and not the library.
race:TestEvent*clone
race:test::run_tests_console::*closure

# Probably more fences in std.

# `is_inline_or_static` is explicitly called concurrently without synchronization.
# The safety explanation can be found in a comment.
race:Inner::is_inline_or_static

# This ignores a false positive caused by `thread::park()`/`thread::unpark()`.
