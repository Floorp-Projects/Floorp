//! Image representations for ffi.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Imagine you want to offer a very simple ffi interface: The caller provides an image buffer and
//! your program creates a thumbnail from it and dumps that image as `png`. This module is designed
//! to help you transition from raw memory data to Rust representation.
//! 
//! ```no_run
//! use std::ptr;
//! use std::slice;
//! use image::Rgb;
//! use image::flat::{FlatSamples, SampleLayout};
//! use image::imageops::thumbnail;
//!
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub extern "C" fn store_rgb8_compressed(
//!     data: *const u8, len: usize,
//!     layout: *const SampleLayout
//! )
//!     -> bool
//! {
//!     let samples = unsafe { slice::from_raw_parts(data, len) };
//!     let layout = unsafe { ptr::read(layout) };
//!
//!     let buffer = FlatSamples {
//!         samples,
//!         layout,
//!         color_hint: None,
//!     };
//!
//!     let view = match buffer.as_view::<Rgb<u8>>() {
//!         Err(_) => return false, // Invalid layout.
//!         Ok(view) => view,
//!     };
//!
//!     thumbnail(&view, 64, 64)
//!         .save("output.png")
//!         .map(|_| true)
//!         .unwrap_or_else(|_| false)
