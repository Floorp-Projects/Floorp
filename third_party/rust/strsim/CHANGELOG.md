# Change Log

This project attempts to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.0] - (2020-01-31)

### Added

- SÃ¸rensen-Dice implementation (thanks [@robjtede](https://github.com/robjtede))

## [0.9.3] - (2019-12-12)

### Fixed

- Fix Jaro and Jaro-Winkler when the arguments have lengths of 1 and are equal.
  Previously, the functions would erroneously return 0 instead of 1. Thanks to
  [@vvrably](https://github.com/vvrably) for pointing out the issue.

## [0.9.2] - (2019-05-09)

### Changed

- Revert back to the standard library hashmap because it will use hashbrown very
  soon
- Remove ndarray in favor of using a single vector to represent the 2d grid in
  Damerau-Levenshtein

## [0.9.1] - (2019-04-08)

### Changed

- Faster Damerau-Levenshtein implementation (thanks [@lovasoa](https://github.com/lovasoa))

## [0.9.0] - (2019-04-06)

### Added

- Generic distance functions (thanks [@lovasoa](https://github.com/lovasoa))

## [0.8.0] - (2018-08-19)

### Added

- Normalized versions of Levenshtein and Damerau-Levenshtein (thanks [@gentoid](https://github.com/gentoid))

## [0.7.0] - (2018-01-17)

### Changed

- Faster Levenshtein implementation (thanks [@wdv4758h](https://github.com/wdv4758h))

### Removed

- Remove the "against_vec" functions. They are one-liners now, so they don't
  seem to add enough value to justify making the API larger. I didn't find
  anybody using them when I skimmed through a GitHub search. If you do use them,
  you can change the calls to something like:
```rust
let distances = strings.iter().map(|a| jaro(target, a)).collect();
```

## [0.6.0] - (2016-12-26)

### Added

- Add optimal string alignment distance

### Fixed

- Fix Damerau-Levenshtein implementation (previous implementation was actually
  optimal string alignment; see this [Damerau-Levenshtein explanation])

## [0.5.2] - (2016-11-21)

### Changed

- Remove Cargo generated documentation in favor of a [docs.rs] link

## [0.5.1] - (2016-08-23)

### Added

- Add Cargo generated documentation

### Fixed

- Fix panic when Jaro or Jaro-Winkler are given strings both with a length of
  one

## [0.5.0] - (2016-08-11)

### Changed

- Make Hamming faster (thanks @IBUzPE9) when the two strings have the same
  length but slower when they have different lengths

## [0.4.1] - (2016-04-18)

### Added

- Add Vagrant setup for development
- Add AppVeyor configuration for Windows CI

### Fixed

- Fix metrics when given strings with multibyte characters (thanks @WanzenBug)

## [0.4.0] - (2015-06-10)

### Added

- For each metric, add a function that takes a vector of strings and returns a
vector of results (thanks @ovarene)

## [0.3.0] - (2015-04-30)

### Changed

- Remove usage of unstable Rust features

## [0.2.5] - (2015-04-24)

### Fixed

- Remove unnecessary `Float` import from doc tests

## [0.2.4] - (2015-04-15)

### Fixed

- Remove unused `core` feature flag

## [0.2.3] - (2015-04-01)

### Fixed

- Remove now unnecessary `Float` import

## [0.2.2] - (2015-03-29)

### Fixed

- Remove usage of `char_at` (marked as unstable)

## [0.2.1] - (2015-02-20)

### Fixed

- Update bit vector import to match Rust update

## [0.2.0] - (2015-02-19)

### Added

- Implement Damerau-Levenshtein
- Add tests in docs

## [0.1.1] - (2015-02-10)

### Added

- Configure Travis for CI
- Add rustdoc comments

### Fixed

- Limit Jaro-Winkler return value to a maximum of 1.0
- Fix float comparisons in tests

## [0.1.0] - (2015-02-09)

### Added

- Implement Hamming, Jaro, Jaro-Winkler, and Levenshtein
