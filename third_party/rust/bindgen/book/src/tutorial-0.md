# Tutorial

The following tutorial is adapted from [this blog post][tutorial].

What follows is a whirlwind introductory tutorial to using `bindgen` from inside
`build.rs`. We'll generate bindings to `bzip2` (which is available on most
systems) on-the-fly.

[**TL;DR?** The full tutorial code is available here.][example]
