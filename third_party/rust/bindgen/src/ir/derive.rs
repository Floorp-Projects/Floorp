//! Traits for determining whether we can derive traits for a thing or not.
//!
//! These traits tend to come in pairs:
//!
//! 1. A "trivial" version, whose implementations aren't allowed to recursively
//! look at other types or the results of fix point analyses.
//!
//! 2. A "normal" version, whose implementations simply query the results of a
//! fix point analysis.
//!
//! The former is used by the analyses when creating the results queried by the
//! second.
