2.0.1
=====

* Arm bugfix

2.0.0
=====

This release replaces `TempFile` with a `tempfile()` function that returnes
`std::fs::File` objects. These are significantly more useful because most rust
libraries expect normal `File` objects.

To continue supporting shared temporary files, this new version adds a
`reopen()` method to `NamedTempFile`.
