//! </strong></p>
//!
//! This crate provides the function [`replace_with()`], which is like [`std::mem::replace()`]
//! except it allows the replacement value to be mapped from the original value.
//!
//! See [RFC 1736](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1736) for a lot of discussion as to its
//! merits. It was never merged, and the desired ability to temporarily move out of `&mut T` doesn't
//! exist yet, so this crate is my interim solution.
//!
//! It's very akin to [`take_mut`](https://github.com/Sgeo/take_mut), though uses `Drop` instead of
//! [`std::panic::catch_unwind()`] to react to unwinding, which avoids the optimisation barrier of
//! calling the `extern "C" __rust_maybe_catch_panic()`. As such it's up to âˆžx faster. The API also
//! attempts to make slightly more explicit the behavior on panic â€“ [`replace_with()`] accepts two
//! closures such that aborting in the "standard case" where the mapping closure (`FnOnce(T) -> T`)
//! panics (as [`take_mut::take()`](https://docs.rs/take_mut/0.2.2/take_mut/fn.take.html) does) is
//! avoided. If the second closure (`FnOnce() -> T`) panics, however, then it does indeed abort.
//! The "abort on first panic" behaviour is available with [`replace_with_or_abort()`].
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! Consider this motivating example:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! # use replace_with::*;
//! enum States {
//!     A(String),
//!     B(String),
//! }
//!
//! impl States {
//!     fn poll(&mut self) {
//!         // error[E0507]: cannot move out of borrowed content
//!         *self = match *self {
//!         //            ^^^^^ cannot move out of borrowed content
//!             States::A(a) => States::B(a),
//!             States::B(a) => States::A(a),
//!         };
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Depending on context this can be quite tricky to work around. With this crate, however:
//!
//! ```
//! # use replace_with::*;
//! enum States {
//!     A(String),
//!     B(String),
//! }
//!
//! # #[cfg(any(feature = "std", feature = "nightly"))]
//! impl States {
//!     fn poll(&mut self) {
//!         replace_with_or_abort(self, |self_| match self_ {
//!             States::A(a) => States::B(a),
//!             States::B(a) => States::A(a),
//!         });
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Huzzah!
