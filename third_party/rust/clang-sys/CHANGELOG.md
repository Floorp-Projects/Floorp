## [1.2.0] - 2021-04-08

### Changed
- Changed `Clang::find` to prefer target-prefixed binaries when a `-target`
argument is provided (e.g., if the arguments `-target` and
`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` are provided, a target-prefixed Clang executable
such as `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-clang` will be preferred over a non-target
prefixed Clang executable)

### Fixed
- Fixed build script to split paths in environment variables (e.g.,
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`) using the appropriate separator for the platform (previously
`:` was used as the separator but some platforms such as Windows use `;`)

## [1.0.2] - 2020-11-17

### Fixed
- Fixed `Clang::find` to properly search directories returned by the
`llvm-config --bindir` and `xcodebuild -find clang` commands
- Improved version selection algorithm in the case where there are multiple
instances of `libclang` with the highest version found; previously the lowest
priority instance would be selected instead of the highest priority instance
(e.g., the versions found by searching the fallback directories were preferred
over the versions found by searching the `llvm-config --prefix` directory)

behavior caused by `Default` implementations for these structs which returns a
zeroed value)

### Added

- Added missing `CXCallingConv_AArch64VectorCall` variant to `CXCallingConv` enum
