Short version for non-lawyers:

The Rust Project is dual-licensed under Apache 2.0 and MIT
terms.


Longer version:

The Rust Project is copyright 2014, The Rust Project
Developers (given in the file AUTHORS.txt).

Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0
<LICENSE-APACHE or
http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0> or the MIT

at your option. All files in the project carrying such
notice may not be copied, modified, or distributed except
according to those terms.

The Rust Project includes packages written by third parties.
The following third party packages are included, and carry
their own copyright notices and license terms:

* Additional copyright may be retained by contributors other
  than Mozilla, the Rust Project Developers, or the parties
  enumerated in this file. Such copyright can be determined
  on a case-by-case basis by examining the author of each
  portion of a file in the revision-control commit records
  of the project, or by consulting representative comments
  claiming copyright ownership for a file.

  For example, the text:

      "Copyright (c) 2011 Google Inc."

  appears in some files, and these files thereby denote
  that their author and copyright-holder is Google Inc.

  In all such cases, the absence of explicit licensing text
  indicates that the contributor chose to license their work
  for distribution under identical terms to those Mozilla
  has chosen for the collective work, enumerated at the top
  of this file. The only difference is the retention of
  copyright itself, held by the contributor.
