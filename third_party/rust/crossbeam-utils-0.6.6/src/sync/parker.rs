/// A thread parking primitive.
///
/// Conceptually, each `Parker` has an associated token which is initially not present:
///
/// * The [`park`] method blocks the current thread unless or until the token is available, at
///   which point it automatically consumes the token. It may also return *spuriously*, without
///   consuming the token.
///
/// * The [`park_timeout`] method works the same as [`park`], but blocks for a specified maximum
///   time.
///
/// * The [`unpark`] method atomically makes the token available if it wasn't already. Because the
///   token is initially absent, [`unpark`] followed by [`park`] will result in the second call
///   returning immediately.
///
/// In other words, each `Parker` acts a bit like a spinlock that can be locked and unlocked using
/// [`park`] and [`unpark`].
///
