# sync15-traits

The sync15-traits support component is a home for the core types and traits
used by Sync. It's extracted into its own crate because these types are used
in so many different contexts, from the [Sync Manager](../sync_manager/index.html)
to desktop Firefox.

Because this is a "support" component, there aren't any instructions for how
to use this component, but you will find documentation for most of the types
and traits implemented here.
