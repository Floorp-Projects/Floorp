# backtrace-rs

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/backtrace)

A library for acquiring backtraces at runtime for Rust. This library aims to
enhance the support of the standard library by providing a programmatic
interface to work with, but it also supports simply easily printing the current
backtrace like libstd's panics.

## Install

```toml
[dependencies]
backtrace = "0.3"
```

Note that this crate requires `cc` and `ar` to be present on Unix systems when
`libbacktrace` is used (which is the default). For configuring C compilers see
the [`cc` crate documentation](https://github.com/alexcrichton/cc-rs).

## Usage

To simply capture a backtrace and defer dealing with it until a later time,
you can use the top-level `Backtrace` type.

```rust
extern crate backtrace;

use backtrace::Backtrace;

fn main() {
    let bt = Backtrace::new();

    // do_some_work();

    println!("{:?}", bt);
}
```

If, however, you'd like more raw access to the actual tracing functionality, you
can use the `trace` and `resolve` functions directly.

```rust
extern crate backtrace;

fn main() {
    backtrace::trace(|frame| {
        let ip = frame.ip();
        let symbol_address = frame.symbol_address();

        // Resolve this instruction pointer to a symbol name
        backtrace::resolve_frame(frame, |symbol| {
            if let Some(name) = symbol.name() {
                // ...
            }
            if let Some(filename) = symbol.filename() {
                // ...
            }
        });

        true // keep going to the next frame
    });
}
```
