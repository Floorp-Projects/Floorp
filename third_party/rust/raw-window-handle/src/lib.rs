//! Interoperability library for Rust Windowing applications.
//!
//! This library provides standard types for accessing a window's platform-specific raw window
//! handle and platforms display handle. This does not provide any utilities for creating and
//! managing windows; instead, it provides a common interface that window creation libraries (e.g.
//! Winit, SDL) can use to easily talk with graphics libraries (e.g. gfx-hal).
//!
//! ## Safety guarantees
//!
//! Please see the docs of [`HasWindowHandle`] and [`HasDisplayHandle`].
//!
//! ## Platform handle initialization
//!
//! Each platform handle struct is purposefully non-exhaustive, so that additional fields may be
//! added without breaking backwards compatibility. Each struct provides an `empty` method that may
//! be used along with the struct update syntax to construct it. See each specific struct for
//! examples.
//!
//! ## Display Handles
//!
//! Some windowing systems use a separate display handle for some operations. The display usually
//! represents a connection to some display server, but it is not necessarily tied to a particular
//! window. See [`RawDisplayHandle`] for more details.
