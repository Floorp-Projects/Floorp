This library provides standard types for accessing a window's platform-specific
raw window handle and display's platform-specific raw display handle. This does
not provide any utilities for creating and managing windows; instead, it
provides a common interface that window creation libraries (e.g. Winit, SDL)
can use to easily talk with graphics libraries (e.g. gfx-hal).
