//! This library exposes a low-level API for creating your own efficient
//! synchronization primitives.
//!
//! # The parking lot
//!
//! To keep synchronization primitives small, all thread queuing and suspending
//! functionality is offloaded to the *parking lot*. The idea behind this is based
//! on the Webkit [`WTF::ParkingLot`](https://webkit.org/blog/6161/locking-in-webkit/)
//! class, which essentially consists of a hash table mapping of lock addresses
//! to queues of parked (sleeping) threads. The Webkit parking lot was itself
//! inspired by Linux [futexes](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/futex.2.html),
//! but it is more powerful since it allows invoking callbacks while holding a
//! queue lock.
//!
//! There are two main operations that can be performed on the parking lot:
//!
//!  - *Parking* refers to suspending the thread while simultaneously enqueuing it
//! on a queue keyed by some address.
//! - *Unparking* refers to dequeuing a thread from a queue keyed by some address
//! and resuming it.
//!
//! See the documentation of the individual functions for more details.
//!
//! # Building custom synchronization primitives
//!
//! Building custom synchronization primitives is very simple since the parking
//! lot takes care of all the hard parts for you. A simple example for a
//! custom primitive would be to integrate a `Mutex` inside another data type.
//! Since a mutex only requires 2 bits, it can share space with other data.
//! For example, one could create an `ArcMutex` type that combines the atomic
//! reference count and the two mutex bits in the same atomic word.
