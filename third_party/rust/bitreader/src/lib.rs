//! BitReader is a helper type to extract strings of bits from a slice of bytes.
//!
//! Here is how you read first a single bit, then three bits and finally four bits from a byte
//! buffer:
//!
//! ```
//! use bitreader::BitReader;
//!
//! let slice_of_u8 = &[0b1000_1111];
//! let mut reader = BitReader::new(slice_of_u8);
//!
//! // You probably should use try! or some other error handling mechanism in real code if the
//! // length of the input is not known in advance.
//! let a_single_bit = reader.read_u8(1).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(a_single_bit, 1);
//!
//! let more_bits = reader.read_u8(3).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(more_bits, 0);
//!
//! let last_bits_of_byte = reader.read_u8(4).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(last_bits_of_byte, 0b1111);
//! ```
//! You can naturally read bits from longer buffer of data than just a single byte.
//!
//! As you read bits, the internal cursor of BitReader moves on along the stream of bits. Big
//! endian format is assumed when reading the multi-byte values. BitReader supports reading maximum
//! of 64 bits at a time (with read_u64). Reading signed values directly is not supported at the
//! moment.
//!
//! The reads do not need to be aligned in any particular way.
//!
//! Reading zero bits is a no-op.
//!
//! You can also skip over a number of bits, in which case there is no arbitrary small limits like
//! when reading the values to a variable. However, you can not seek past the end of the slice,
//! either when reading or when skipping bits.
//!
//! Note that the code will likely not work correctly if the slice is longer than 2^61 bytes, but
//! exceeding that should be pretty unlikely. Let's get back to this when people read exabytes of
//! information one bit at a time.
