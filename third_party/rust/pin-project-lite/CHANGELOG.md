- [`pin_project!` macro now supports enums.](https://github.com/taiki-e/pin-project-lite/pull/28)

  To use `pin_project!` on enums, you need to name the projection type returned from the method.

  ```rust
  use pin_project_lite::pin_project;
  use std::pin::Pin;

  pin_project! {
      #[project = EnumProj]
      enum Enum<T, U> {
          Variant { #[pin] pinned: T, unpinned: U },
      }
  }

  impl<T, U> Enum<T, U> {
      fn method(self: Pin<&mut Self>) {
          match self.project() {
              EnumProj::Variant { pinned, unpinned } => {
                  let _: Pin<&mut T> = pinned;
                  let _: &mut U = unpinned;
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```

- [Support naming the projection types.](https://github.com/taiki-e/pin-project-lite/pull/28)

  By passing an attribute with the same name as the method, you can name the projection type returned from the method:

  ```rust
  use pin_project_lite::pin_project;
  use std::pin::Pin;

  pin_project! {
      #[project = StructProj]
      struct Struct<T> {
          #[pin]
          field: T,
      }
  }

  fn func<T>(x: Pin<&mut Struct<T>>) {
      let StructProj { field } = x.project();
      let _: Pin<&mut T> = field;
  }
  ```
