# Expansion tests

Similar to ui tests, but instead of checking the compiler output, this checks
the code generated by macros.

See [examples](https://github.com/taiki-e/pin-project/tree/HEAD/examples) for
descriptions of what the generated code does, and why it needs to be generated.

To run this test, run the following command:

```sh
cargo +nightly test --test expandtest
```

Locally, this test updates the files in the `expand` directory if there are
changes to the generated code. If there are any changes to the files in the
`expand` directory after running the test, please commit them.
