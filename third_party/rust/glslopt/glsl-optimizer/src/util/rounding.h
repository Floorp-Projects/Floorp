/* The C standard library has functions round()/rint()/nearbyint() that round
 * their arguments according to the rounding mode set in the floating-point
 * control register. While there are trunc()/ceil()/floor() functions that do
 * a specific operation without modifying the rounding mode, there is no
 * roundeven() in any version of C.
 *
 * Technical Specification 18661 (ISO/IEC TS 18661-1:2014) adds roundeven(),
 * but it's unfortunately not implemented by glibc.
 *
 * This implementation differs in that it does not raise the inexact exception.
 *
 * We use rint() to implement these functions, with the assumption that the
 * floating-point rounding mode has not been changed from the default Round
 * to Nearest.
