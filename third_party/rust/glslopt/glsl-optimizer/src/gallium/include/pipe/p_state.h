 * Abstract graphics pipe state objects.
 *
 * Basic notes:
 *   1. Want compact representations, so we use bitfields.
 *   2. Put bitfields before other (GLfloat) fields.
 *   3. enum bitfields need to be at least one bit extra in size so the most
 *      significant bit is zero.  MSVC treats enums as signed so if the high
 *      bit is set, the value will be interpreted as a negative number.
 *      That causes trouble in various places.
