    * operates on constants.  These constants are the result of non-constant
    * expressions that have been optimized to constants.  The common case here
    * is a loop counter from an unrolled loop that is used to index a vector.
    *
    * The ir_swizzle constructor gets angry if the index is negative or too
    * large.  For simplicity sake, just clamp the index to [0, size-1].
