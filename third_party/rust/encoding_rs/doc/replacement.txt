/// This decode-only encoding decodes all non-zero-length streams to a single
/// REPLACEMENT CHARACTER. Its purpose is to avoid the use of an
/// ASCII-compatible fallback encoding (typically windows-1252) for some
/// encodings that are no longer supported by the Web Platform and that
/// would be dangerous to treat as ASCII-compatible.
///
/// There is no corresponding encoder. The output encoding of this encoding
/// is UTF-8.

/// This encoding does not have a Windows code page number.
