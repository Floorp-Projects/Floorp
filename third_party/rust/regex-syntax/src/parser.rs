    /// explicit recursion. While this crate never does this (instead using
    /// constant stack space and moving the call stack to the heap), other

    /// if callers want to put a limit on the amount of heap space used, then

    /// pattern string. In particular, this is viable since this parser
    /// implementation will limit itself to heap space proportional to the
    /// lenth of the pattern string.

    /// patterns but not all. For example, a nest limit of `0` permits `a` but
    /// not `ab`, since `ab` requires a concatenation, which results in a nest
