/// Creates a future which represents a collection of the outputs of the futures
/// given.
///
/// The returned future will drive execution for all of its underlying futures,
/// collecting the results into a destination `Vec<T>` in the same order as they
/// were provided.
///
/// This function is only available when the `std` or `alloc` feature of this
/// library is activated, and it is activated by default.
///
/// # See Also
///
/// This is purposefully a very simple API for basic use-cases. In a lot of
/// cases you will want to use the more powerful
/// [`FuturesOrdered`][crate::stream::FuturesOrdered] APIs, or, if order does
/// not matter, [`FuturesUnordered`][crate::stream::FuturesUnordered].
///
/// Some examples for additional functionality provided by these are:
///
///  * Adding new futures to the set even after it has been started.
///
///  * Only polling the specific futures that have been woken. In cases where
///    you have a lot of futures this will result in much more efficient polling.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// # futures::executor::block_on(async {
/// use futures::future::join_all;
///
/// async fn foo(i: u32) -> u32 { i }
///
/// let futures = vec![foo(1), foo(2), foo(3)];
///
/// assert_eq!(join_all(futures).await, [1, 2, 3]);
/// # });
