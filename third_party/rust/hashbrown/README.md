This crate is a Rust port of Google's high-performance [SwissTable] hash
map, adapted to make it a drop-in replacement for Rust's standard `HashMap`
and `HashSet` types.

The original C++ version of SwissTable can be found [here], and this
[CppCon talk] gives an overview of how the algorithm works.

Since Rust 1.36, this is now the `HashMap` implementation for the Rust standard
library. However you may still want to use this crate instead since it works
in environments without `std`, such as embedded systems and kernels.

## [Change log](CHANGELOG.md)

## Features

- Drop-in replacement for the standard library `HashMap` and `HashSet` types.
- Uses `AHash` as the default hasher, which is much faster than SipHash.
- Around 2x faster than the previous standard library `HashMap`.
- Lower memory usage: only 1 byte of overhead per entry instead of 8.
- Compatible with `#[no_std]` (but requires a global allocator with the `alloc` crate).
- Empty hash maps do not allocate any memory.
- SIMD lookups to scan multiple hash entries in parallel.

## Performance

Compared to the previous implementation of `std::collections::HashMap` (Rust 1.35).

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
hashbrown = "0.9"
```

Then:

```rust
use hashbrown::HashMap;

let mut map = HashMap::new();
map.insert(1, "one");
```

This crate has the following Cargo features:

- `nightly`: Enables nightly-only features: `#[may_dangle]`.
- `serde`: Enables serde serialization support.
- `rayon`: Enables rayon parallel iterator support.
- `raw`: Enables access to the experimental and unsafe `RawTable` API.
- `inline-more`: Adds inline hints to most functions, improving run-time performance at the cost
  of compilation time. (enabled by default)
- `ahash`: Compiles with ahash as default hasher. (enabled by default)
- `ahash-compile-time-rng`: Activates the `compile-time-rng` feature of ahash, to increase the
   DOS-resistance, but can result in issues for `no_std` builds. More details in
   [issue#124](https://github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/124). (enabled by default)
