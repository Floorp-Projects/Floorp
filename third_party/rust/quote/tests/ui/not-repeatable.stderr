  |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ method cannot be called on `Ipv4Addr` due to unsatisfied trait bounds

  = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
          `Ipv4Addr: Iterator`
          which is required by `Ipv4Addr: quote::__private::ext::RepIteratorExt`
          `&Ipv4Addr: Iterator`
          which is required by `&Ipv4Addr: quote::__private::ext::RepIteratorExt`
          `Ipv4Addr: ToTokens`
          which is required by `Ipv4Addr: quote::__private::ext::RepToTokensExt`
          `&mut Ipv4Addr: Iterator`
          which is required by `&mut Ipv4Addr: quote::__private::ext::RepIteratorExt`
  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::quote_bind_into_iter` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
