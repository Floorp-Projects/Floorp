# Feature Requests
[Feature Requests]: #feature-requests

The `uuid` crate is still in flux. All features desired may not be present. As
such you are welcome to request for new features. Keep in mind that `uuid` is
a general purpose library. We want to provide features that most users would
find useful. As such not every feature may be accepted.

If you have the chance, please [search existing issues], as there is a chance
that someone has already requested your feature.

File your feature request with a descriptive title, as this helps others find
your request.

You can request your feature by following [this link][Feature Request Link] and
filling it in. 

> We welcome pull requests for your own feature requests, provided they have
been discussed.

# Bug Reports
[Bug Reports]: #bug-reports

While no one likes bugs, they are an unfortunate reality in software. Remember
we can't fix bugs we don't know about, so don't be shy about reporting.

If you have the chance, please [search existing issues], as there is a chance
that someone has already reported your error. This isn't strictly needed, as
sometimes you might not what exactly you are looking for.

File your issue with a descriptive title, as this helps others find your issue.

Reporting a bug is as easy as following [this link][Bug Report Link] and
filling it in.

Sometimes a backtrace may be needed. In that case, set `RUST_BACKTRACE`
environment variable to `1`. For example:

```bash
$ RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo build
```

discussed.

# Pull Requests
[Pull Requests]: #pull-requests

Pull requests(PRs) are the primary mechanism we use to change Uuid. GitHub itself
has some [great documentation] on using the Pull Request feature. We use the
"fork and pull" model described [here][fnp], where contributors push changes to
their personal fork and create pull requests to bring those changes into the
source repository.

Unless the changes are fairly minor (like documentation changes or tiny
patches), we require PRs to relevant issues.

Please open PRs against branch:
* `master` when making non-breaking changes 
* `breaking` when your changes alter the public API in a breaking manner

If the pull request is still a work in progress, prepend`[WIP] ` in your 
title. `WIP bot` will make sure that the PR doesn't accidentally get merged.

> Uuid Project has a minimum rust version policy. Currently `uuid` should 
compile with atleast `1.22.0`, and is enforced on our CI builds.

When you feel that the PR is ready, please ping one of the maintainers so
they can review your changes.

# Writing Documentation
[Writing Documentation]: #writing-documentation

Documentation is an important part of Uuid. Lackluster or incorrect
documentation can cause headaches for the users of `uuid`. Therefore,
improvements to documentation are always welcome.

We follow the documentation style guidelines as given by [RFC 1574].

[RFC 1574]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1574-more-api-documentation-conventions.md#appendix-a-full-conventions-text

# Issue Triage
[Issue Triage]: #issue-triage

Sometimes, an issue might stay open even after the relevant bug has been fixed.
Other times, the bug report may become invalid. Or we may just forget about the
bug.

You can help to go through old bug reports and check if they are still valid.
You can follow [this link][lrus] to look for issues like this.
