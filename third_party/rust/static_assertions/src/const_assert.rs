/// Asserts that constant expressions evaluate to `true`.
///
/// Constant expressions can be ensured to have certain properties via this
/// macro If the expression evaluates to `false`, the file will fail to compile.
/// This is synonymous to [`static_assert` in C++][static_assert].
///
/// # Alternatives
///
/// There also exists [`const_assert_eq`](macro.const_assert_eq.html) for
/// validating whether a sequence of expressions are equal to one another.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// A common use case is to guarantee properties about a constant value that's
/// generated via meta-programming.
///
/// ```
/// # #[macro_use] extern crate static_assertions; fn main() {}
/// const VALUE: i32 = // ...
/// # 3;
///
/// const_assert!(VALUE >= 2);
/// ```
///
/// Inputs are type-checked as booleans:
///
/// ```compile_fail
/// # #[macro_use] extern crate static_assertions; fn main() {}
/// const_assert!(!0);
/// ```
///
/// Despite this being a macro, we see this produces a type error:
///
/// ```txt
///   | const_assert!(!0);
///   |               ^^ expected bool, found integral variable
///   |
///   = note: expected type `bool`
///              found type `{integer}`

/// The following fails to compile because multiplying by 5 does not have an
/// identity property:
