// * Arc<T>
// * *const ArcWrapped<T>
//
// We don't actually know the layout of `ArcWrapped<T>` as it's an
// implementation detail in the standard library. We can work, though, by
// casting it through and back an `Arc<T>`.

// because it's the wrong level of indirection. These methods are sort of
// receiving Arc<T>, but not an owned version. It's... complicated. We may be
// one of the first users of unsafe trait objects!
