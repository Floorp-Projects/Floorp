use core::mem;

use {Future, IntoFuture, Async, Poll};
use stream::Stream;

/// Creates a `Stream` from a seed and a closure returning a `Future`.
///
/// This function is the dual for the `Stream::fold()` adapter: while
/// `Stream:fold()` reduces a `Stream` to one single value, `unfold()` creates a
/// `Stream` from a seed value.
///
/// `unfold()` will call the provided closure with the provided seed, then wait
/// for the returned `Future` to complete with `(a, b)`. It will then yield the
/// value `a`, and use `b` as the next internal state.
///
/// If the closure returns `None` instead of `Some(Future)`, then the `unfold()`
/// will stop producing items and return `Ok(Async::Ready(None))` in future
/// calls to `poll()`.
///
/// In case of error generated by the returned `Future`, the error will be
/// returned by the `Stream`.  The `Stream` will then yield
/// `Ok(Async::Ready(None))` in future calls to `poll()`.
///
/// This function can typically be used when wanting to go from the "world of
/// futures" to the "world of streams": the provided closure can build a
/// `Future` using other library functions working on futures, and `unfold()`
/// will turn it into a `Stream` by repeating the operation.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use futures::stream::{self, Stream};
/// use futures::future::{self, Future};
///
/// let mut stream = stream::unfold(0, |state| {
///     if state <= 2 {
///         let next_state = state + 1;
///         let yielded = state  * 2;
///         let fut = future::ok::<_, u32>((yielded, next_state));
///         Some(fut)
///     } else {
///         None
///     }
/// });
///
/// let result = stream.collect().wait();
/// assert_eq!(result, Ok(vec![0, 2, 4]));
/// ```
