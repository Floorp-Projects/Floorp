## Usage

First, add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
futures = "0.1.17"
```

Next, add this to your crate:

```rust
extern crate futures;

use futures::Future;
```

For more information about how you can use futures with async I/O you can take a
look at [https://tokio.rs](https://tokio.rs) which is an introduction to both
the Tokio stack and also futures.

### Feature `use_std`

`futures-rs` works without the standard library, such as in bare metal environments.
However, it has a significantly reduced API surface. To use `futures-rs` in
a `#[no_std]` environment, use:

```toml
[dependencies]
futures = { version = "0.1.17", default-features = false }
```
