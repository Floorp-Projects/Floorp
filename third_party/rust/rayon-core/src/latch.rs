/// We define various kinds of latches, which are all a primitive signaling
/// mechanism. A latch starts as false. Eventually someone calls `set()` and
/// it becomes true. You can test if it has been set by calling `probe()`.
///
/// Some kinds of latches, but not all, support a `wait()` operation
/// that will wait until the latch is set, blocking efficiently. That
/// is not part of the trait since it is not possibly to do with all
/// latches.
///
/// The intention is that `set()` is called once, but `probe()` may be
/// called any number of times. Once `probe()` returns true, the memory
/// effects that occurred before `set()` become visible.
///
/// It'd probably be better to refactor the API into two paired types,
/// but that's a bit of work, and this is not a public API.
///
/// ## Memory ordering
///
/// Latches need to guarantee two things:
///
/// - Once `probe()` returns true, all memory effects from the `set()`
///   are visible (in other words, the set should synchronize-with
///   the probe).
/// - Once `set()` occurs, the next `probe()` *will* observe it.  This
///   typically requires a seq-cst ordering. See [the "tickle-then-get-sleepy" scenario in the sleep
///   README](/src/sleep/README.md#tickle-then-get-sleepy) for details.
