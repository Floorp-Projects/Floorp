A memory-safer wrapper around system dynamic library loading primitives. The most important safety
guarantee by this library is prevention of dangling-`Symbol`s that may occur after a `Library` is
unloaded.

Using this library allows loading dynamic libraries (also known as shared libraries) as well as use
functions and static variables these libraries contain.
