# diff.rs

> An LCS based slice and string diffing implementation.

## Example

```rust
extern crate diff;

fn main() {
    let left = "foo\nbar\nbaz\nquux";
    let right = "foo\nbaz\nbar\nquux";

    for diff in diff::lines(left, right) {
        match diff {
            diff::Result::Left(l)    => println!("-{}", l),
            diff::Result::Both(l, _) => println!(" {}", l),
            diff::Result::Right(r)   => println!("+{}", r)
        }
    }
}
```

prints

```
 foo
-bar
 baz
+bar
 quux
```
