//! Main file / top-level module for regalloc library.
//!
//! We have tried hard to make the library's interface as simple as possible,
//! yet flexible enough that the allocators it implements can provide good
//! quality allocations in reasonable time.  Nevertheless, there is still
//! significant semantic complexity in parts of the interface.  If you intend
//! to use this library in your own code, you would be well advised to read
//! the comments in this file very carefully.

// The "register universe".  This describes the registers available to the
// allocator.  There are very strict requirements on the structure of the
// universe.  If you fail to observe these requirements, either the allocator
// itself, or the resulting code, will fail in mysterious ways, and your life
// will be miserable while you try to figure out what happened.  There are
// lower level details on the definition of RealRegUniverse which you also
// need to take note of.  The overall contract is as follows.
//
// === (1) === Basic structure ===
//
// A "register universe" is a read-only structure that contains all
// information about real registers on a given host.  For each register class
// (RegClass) supported by the target, the universe must provide a vector of
// registers that the allocator may use.
//
// The universe may also list other registers that the incoming
// virtual-registerised code may use, but which are not available for use by
// the allocator.  Indeed, the universe *must* list *all* registers that will
// ever be mentioned in the incoming code.  Failure to do so will cause the
// allocator's analysis phase to return an error.
//
// === (2) === Ordering of registers within each class
//
// The ordering of available registers within these vectors does not affect
// the correctness of the final allocation.  However, it will affect the
// quality of final allocation.  Clients are recommended to list, for each
// class, the callee-saved registers first, and the caller-saved registers
// after that.  The currently supported allocation algorithms (Backtracking
// and LinearScan) will try to use the first available registers in each
// class, that is to say, callee-saved ones first.  The purpose of this is to
// try and minimise spilling around calls by avoiding use of caller-saved ones
// if possible.
//
// There is a twist here, however.  The abovementioned heuristic works well
// for non-leaf functions (functions that contain at least one call).  But for
// leaf functions, we would prefer to use the caller-saved registers first,
// since doing so has potential to minimise the number of registers that must
// be saved/restored in the prologue and epilogue.  Presently there is no way
// to tell this interface that the function is a leaf function, and so the
// only way to get optimal code in this case is to present a universe with the
// registers listed in the opposite order.
//
// This is of course inconvenient for the caller, since it requires
// maintenance of two separate universes.  In the future we will add a boolean
// parameter to the top level function `allocate_registers` that indicates
// that whether or not the function is a leaf function.
//
// === (3) === The "suggested scratch register" ===
//
// Some allocation algorithms, particularly linear-scan, may need to have a
// scratch register available for their own use.  The register universe must
// nominate a scratch register in each class, specified in
// RealRegUniverse::allocable_by_class[..]::Some(suggested_scratch).  The
// choice of scratch register is influenced by the architecture, the ABI, and
// client-side fixed-use register conventions.  There rules are as follows:
//
// (1) For each class, the universe must offer a reserved register.
//
// (2) The reserved register may not have any implied-by-the architecture
//     reads/modifies/writes for any instruction in the vcode.  Unfortunately
//     there is no easy way for this library to check that.
//
// (3) The reserved register must not have any reads or modifies by any
//     instruction in the vcode.  In other words, it must not be handed to
//     either the `add_use` or `add_mod` function of the `RegUsageCollector`
//     that is presented to the client's `get_regs` function.  If any such
//     mention is detected, the library will return an error.
//
// (4) The reserved reg may be mentioned as written by instructions in the
//     vcode, though -- in other words it may be handed to `add_def`.  The
//     library will tolerate and correctly handle that.  However, because no
//     vcode instruction may read or modify the reserved register, all such
//     writes are "dead".  This in turn guarantees that the allocator can, if
//     it wants, change the value in it at any time, without changing the
//     behaviour of the final generated code.
//
// Currently, the LinearScan algorithm may use the reserved registers.  The
// Backtracking algorithm will ignore the hints and treat them as "normal"
// allocatable registers.
