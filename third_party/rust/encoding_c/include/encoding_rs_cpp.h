/**
 * A converter that decodes a byte stream into Unicode according to a
 * character encoding in a streaming (incremental) manner.
 *
 * The various `decode_*` methods take an input buffer (`src`) and an output
 * buffer `dst` both of which are caller-allocated. There are variants for
 * both UTF-8 and UTF-16 output buffers.
 *
 * A `decode_*` method decodes bytes from `src` into Unicode characters stored
 * into `dst` until one of the following three things happens:
 *
 * 1. A malformed byte sequence is encountered (`*_without_replacement`
 *    variants only).
 *
 * 2. The output buffer has been filled so near capacity that the decoder
 *    cannot be sure that processing an additional byte of input wouldn't
 *    cause so much output that the output buffer would overflow.
 *
 * 3. All the input bytes have been processed.
 *
 * The `decode_*` method then returns tuple of a status indicating which one
 * of the three reasons to return happened, how many input bytes were read,
 * how many output code units (`uint8_t` when decoding into UTF-8 and `char16_t`
 * when decoding to UTF-16) were written, and in the case of the
 * variants performing replacement, a boolean indicating whether an error was
 * replaced with the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER during the call.
 *
 * The number of bytes "written" is what's logically written. Garbage may be
 * written in the output buffer beyond the point logically written to.
 *
 * In the case of the `*_without_replacement` variants, the status is a
 * `uint32_t` whose possible values are packed info about a malformed byte
 * sequence, `OUTPUT_FULL` and `INPUT_EMPTY` corresponding to the three cases
 * listed above).
 *
 * Packed info about malformed sequences has the following format:
 * The lowest 8 bits, which can have the decimal value 0, 1, 2 or 3,
 * indicate the number of bytes that were consumed after the malformed
 * sequence and whose next-lowest 8 bits, when shifted right by 8 indicate
 * the length of the malformed byte sequence (possible decimal values 1, 2,
 * 3 or 4). The maximum possible sum of the two is 6.
 *
 * In the case of methods whose name does not end with
 * `*_without_replacement`, malformed sequences are automatically replaced
 * with the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER and errors do not cause the methods to
 * return early.
 *
 * When decoding to UTF-8, the output buffer must have at least 4 bytes of
 * space. When decoding to UTF-16, the output buffer must have at least two
 * UTF-16 code units (`char16_t`) of space.
 *
 * When decoding to UTF-8 without replacement, the methods are guaranteed
 * not to return indicating that more output space is needed if the length
 * of the output buffer is at least the length returned by
 * `max_utf8_buffer_length_without_replacement()`. When decoding to UTF-8
 * with replacement, the length of the output buffer that guarantees the
 * methods not to return indicating that more output space is needed is given
 * by `max_utf8_buffer_length()`. When decoding to UTF-16 with
 * or without replacement, the length of the output buffer that guarantees
 * the methods not to return indicating that more output space is needed is
 * given by `max_utf16_buffer_length()`.
 *
 * The output written into `dst` is guaranteed to be valid UTF-8 or UTF-16,
 * and the output after each `decode_*` call is guaranteed to consist of
 * complete characters. (I.e. the code unit sequence for the last character is
 * guaranteed not to be split across output buffers.)
 *
 * The boolean argument `last` indicates that the end of the stream is reached
 * when all the bytes in `src` have been consumed.
 *
 * A `Decoder` object can be used to incrementally decode a byte stream.
 *
 * During the processing of a single stream, the caller must call `decode_*`
 * zero or more times with `last` set to `false` and then call `decode_*` at
 * least once with `last` set to `true`. If `decode_*` returns `INPUT_EMPTY`,
 * the processing of the stream has ended. Otherwise, the caller must call
 * `decode_*` again with `last` set to `true` (or treat a malformed result,
 * i.e. neither `INPUT_EMPTY` nor `OUTPUT_FULL`, as a fatal error).
 *
 * Once the stream has ended, the `Decoder` object must not be used anymore.
 * That is, you need to create another one to process another stream.
 *
 * When the decoder returns `OUTPUT_FULL` or the decoder returns a malformed
 * result and the caller does not wish to treat it as a fatal error, the input
 * buffer `src` may not have been completely consumed. In that case, the caller
 * must pass the unconsumed contents of `src` to `decode_*` again upon the next
 * call.
 *
 * # Infinite loops
 *
 * When converting with a fixed-size output buffer whose size is too small to
 * accommodate one character of output, an infinite loop ensues. When
 * converting with a fixed-size output buffer, it generally makes sense to
 * make the buffer fairly large (e.g. couple of kilobytes).

 * In the case of the methods whose name ends with

 * with the corresponding numeric character references and unmappable

 * guarantees the methods not to return indicating that more output space is
 * needed in the absence of unmappable characters is given by
 * `max_buffer_length_from_utf16_if_no_unmappables()`.
 * When encoding with replacement, applications are not expected to size the
 * buffer for the worst case ahead of time but to resize the buffer if there
 * are unmappable characters. This is why max length queries are only available
 * for the case where there are no unmappable characters.
 *
 * When encoding from UTF-8, each `src` buffer _must_ be valid UTF-8. When
 * encoding from UTF-16, unpaired surrogates in the input are treated as U+FFFD
 * REPLACEMENT CHARACTERS. Therefore, in order for astral characters not to
 * turn into a pair of REPLACEMENT CHARACTERS, the caller must ensure that
 * surrogate pairs are not split across input buffer boundaries.
 *
 * After an `encode_*` call returns, the output produced so far, taken as a
 * whole from the start of the stream, is guaranteed to consist of a valid
 * byte sequence in the target encoding. (I.e. the code unit sequence for a
 * character is guaranteed not to be split across output buffers. However, due
 * to the stateful nature of ISO-2022-JP, the stream needs to be considered
 * from the start for it to be valid. For other encodings, the validity holds
 * on a per-output buffer basis.)
 *
 * The boolean argument `last` indicates that the end of the stream is reached
 * when all the characters in `src` have been consumed. This argument is needed
 * for ISO-2022-JP and is ignored for other encodings.
 *
 * An `Encoder` object can be used to incrementally encode a byte stream.
 *
 * During the processing of a single stream, the caller must call `encode_*`
 * zero or more times with `last` set to `false` and then call `encode_*` at
 * least once with `last` set to `true`. If `encode_*` returns `INPUT_EMPTY`,
 * the processing of the stream has ended. Otherwise, the caller must call
 * `encode_*` again with `last` set to `true` (or treat an unmappable result,
 * i.e. neither `INPUT_EMPTY` nor `OUTPUT_FULL`, as a fatal error).
 *
 * Once the stream has ended, the `Encoder` object must not be used anymore.
 * That is, you need to create another one to process another stream.

/**
 * An encoding as defined in the Encoding Standard
 * (https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/).
 *
 * An _encoding_ defines a mapping from a byte sequence to a Unicode code point
 * sequence and, in most cases, vice versa. Each encoding has a name, an output
 * encoding, and one or more labels.
 *
 * _Labels_ are ASCII-case-insensitive strings that are used to identify an
 * encoding in formats and protocols. The _name_ of the encoding is the
 * preferred label in the case appropriate for returning from the
 * `characterSet` property of the `Document` DOM interface, except for
 * the replacement encoding whose name is not one of its labels.
 *
 * The _output encoding_ is the encoding used for form submission and URL
 * parsing on Web pages in the encoding. This is UTF-8 for the replacement,
 * UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE encodings and the encoding itself for other
 * encodings.
 *
 * # Streaming vs. Non-Streaming
 *
 * When you have the entire input in a single buffer, you can use the
 * methods `decode()`, `decode_with_bom_removal()`,
 * `decode_without_bom_handling()`,
 * `decode_without_bom_handling_and_without_replacement()` and
 * `encode()`. Unlike the rest of the API, these methods perform heap
 * allocations. You should the `Decoder` and `Encoder` objects when your input
 * is split into multiple buffers or when you want to control the allocation of
 * the output buffers.
 *
 * # Instances
 *
 * All instances of `Encoding` are statically allocated and have the process's
 * lifetime. There is precisely one unique `Encoding` instance for each
 * encoding defined in the Encoding Standard.
 *
 * To obtain a reference to a particular encoding whose identity you know at
 * compile time, use a `static` that refers to encoding. There is a `static`
 * for each encoding. The `static`s are named in all caps with hyphens
 * replaced with underscores and with `_ENCODING` appended to the
 * name. For example, if you know at compile time that you will want to
 * decode using the UTF-8 encoding, use the `UTF_8_ENCODING` `static`.
 *
 * If you don't know what encoding you need at compile time and need to
 * dynamically get an encoding by label, use `Encoding::for_label()`.
 *
 * Instances of `Encoding` can be compared with `==`.
