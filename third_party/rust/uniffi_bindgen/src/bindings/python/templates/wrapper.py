# This file was autogenerated by some hot garbage in the `uniffi` crate.
# Trust me, you don't want to mess with it!

# Common helper code.
#
# Ideally this would live in a separate .py file where it can be unittested etc
# in isolation, and perhaps even published as a re-useable package.
#
# However, it's important that the details of how this helper code works (e.g. the
# way that different builtin types are passed across the FFI) exactly match what's
# expected by the rust code on the other side of the interface. In practice right
# now that means coming from the exact some version of `uniffi` that was used to
# compile the rust component. The easiest way to ensure this is to bundle the Python
# helpers directly inline like we're doing here.
