//! # Backend traits
//!
//! This module provides a number of traits useful for implementing a backend for Uniffi.
//!
//! A `CodeType` is needed for each type that will cross the FFI. It should provide helper machinery
//! in the target language to lift from and lower into a value of that type into a primitive type
//! (the FFIType), and foreign language expressions that call into the machinery. This helper code
//! can be provided by a template file.
//!
//! A `CodeDeclaration` is needed for each type that is declared in the UDL file. This has access to
//! the [crate::interface::ComponentInterface], which is the closest thing to an Intermediate Representation.
//!
//! `CodeDeclaration`s provide the target language's version of the UDL type, including forwarding method calls
//! into Rust. It is likely if you're implementing a `CodeDeclaration` for this purpose, it will also need to cross
//! the FFI, and you'll also need a `CodeType`.
//!
//! `CodeDeclaration`s can also be used to conditionally include code: e.g. only include the CallbackInterfaceRuntime
//! if the user has used at least one callback interface.
//!
//! Each backend has a wrapper template for each file it needs to generate. This should collect the `CodeDeclaration`s that
//! the backend and `ComponentInterface` between them specify and use them to stitch together a file in the target language.
//!
//! The `CodeOracle` provides methods to map the `Type` values found in the `ComponentInterface` to the `CodeType`s specified
//! by the backend. It also provides methods for transforming identifiers into the coding standard for the target language.
//!
//! Each backend will have its own `filter` module, which is used by the askama templates used in all `CodeType`s and `CodeDeclaration`s.
//! This filter provides methods to generate expressions and identifiers in the target language. These are all forwarded to the oracle.
