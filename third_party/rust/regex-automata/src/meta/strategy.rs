/// A trait that represents a single meta strategy. Its main utility is in

///
/// Why dynamic dispatch? I actually don't have a super compelling reason, and
/// importantly, I have not benchmarked it with the main alternative: an enum.
/// I went with dynamic dispatch initially because the regex engine search code
/// really can't be inlined into caller code in most cases because it's just
/// too big. In other words, it is already expected that every regex search
/// will entail at least the cost of a function call.
///
/// I do wonder whether using enums would result in better codegen overall
/// though. It's a worthwhile experiment to try. Probably the most interesting
/// benchmark to run in such a case would be one with a high match count. That
/// is, a benchmark to test the overall latency of a search call.

// as the regex only contains one pattern, we can simply assume that a match
// corresponds to PatternID::ZERO. And indeed, that's what we do here.
//
// In practice, since this impl is used to report matches directly and thus
// completely bypasses the regex engine, we only wind up using this under the
// following restrictions:
//
// * There must be only one pattern. As explained above.
// * The literal sequence must be finite and only contain exact literals.
// * There must not be any look-around assertions. If there are, the literals
// extracted might be exact, but a match doesn't necessarily imply an overall
// match. As a trivial example, 'foo\bbar' does not match 'foobar'.
// * The pattern must not have any explicit capturing groups. If it does, the
// caller might expect them to be resolved. e.g., 'foo(bar)'.
//
// So when all of those things are true, we use a prefilter directly as a
// strategy.
//
// In the case where the number of patterns is more than 1, we don't use this
// but do use a special Aho-Corasick strategy if all of the regexes are just
// simple literals or alternations of literals. (We also use the Aho-Corasick
// strategy when len(patterns)==1 if the number of literals is large. In that
