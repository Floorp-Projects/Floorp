/*!
Types and routines for working with look-around assertions.

This module principally defines two types:

* [`Look`] enumerates all of the assertions supported by this crate.
* [`LookSet`] provides a way to efficiently store a set of [`Look`] values.
* [`LookMatcher`] provides routines for checking whether a `Look` or a
`LookSet` matches at a particular position in a haystack.
*/

// LAMENTATION: Sadly, a lot of the API of `Look` and `LookSet` were basically
// copied verbatim from the regex-syntax crate. I would have no problems using
// the regex-syntax types and defining the matching routines (only found
// in this crate) as free functions, except the `Look` and `LookSet` types
// are used in lots of places. Including in places we expect to work when
// regex-syntax is *not* enabled, such as in the definition of the NFA itself.
//
// Thankfully the code we copy is pretty simple and there isn't much of it.
// Otherwise, the rest of this module deals with *matching* the assertions,
// which is not something that regex-syntax handles.

use crate::util::{escape::DebugByte, utf8};

/// A look-around assertion.
///
/// An assertion matches at a position between characters in a haystack.
/// Namely, it does not actually "consume" any input as most parts of a regular
/// expression do. Assertions are a way of stating that some property must be
/// true at a particular point during matching.
///
/// For example, `(?m)^[a-z]+$` is a pattern that:
///
/// * Scans the haystack for a position at which `(?m:^)` is satisfied. That
/// occurs at either the beginning of the haystack, or immediately following
/// a `\n` character.
/// * Looks for one or more occurrences of `[a-z]`.
/// * Once `[a-z]+` has matched as much as it can, an overall match is only
/// reported when `[a-z]+` stops just before a `\n`.
///
/// So in this case, `abc` and `\nabc\n` match, but `\nabc1\n` does not.
///
/// Assertions are also called "look-around," "look-behind" and "look-ahead."
/// Specifically, some assertions are look-behind (like `^`), other assertions
/// are look-ahead (like `$`) and yet other assertions are both look-ahead and
/// look-behind (like `\b`).
///
/// # Assertions in an NFA
///
/// An assertion in a [`thompson::NFA`](crate::nfa::thompson::NFA) can be
/// thought of as a conditional epsilon transition. That is, a matching engine
/// like the [`PikeVM`](crate::nfa::thompson::pikevm::PikeVM) only permits
/// moving through conditional epsilon transitions when their condition
/// is satisfied at whatever position the `PikeVM` is currently at in the
/// haystack.
///
/// How assertions are handled in a `DFA` is trickier, since a DFA does not
/// have epsilon transitions at all. In this case, they are compiled into the
/// automaton itself, at the expense of more states than what would be required
/// without an assertion.

        // a codepoint on either side of `at`. If either direction fails, then
        // we don't permit \B to match at all.
        //
        // Now, this isn't exactly optimal from a perf perspective. We could

// Below are FOUR different ways for checking whether whether a "word"

// different approaches are, in order of preference:
//
// 1. Parse '\w', convert to an NFA, convert to a fully compiled DFA on the
// first call, and then use that DFA for all subsequent calls.
// 2. Do UTF-8 decoding and use regex_syntax::is_word_character if available.
// 3. Do UTF-8 decoding and use our own 'perl_word' table.
// 4. Return an error.
//
// The reason for all of these approaches is a combination of perf and
// permitting one to build regex-automata without the Unicode data necessary
// for handling Unicode-aware word boundaries. (In which case, '(?-u:\b)' would
// still work.)
//
// The DFA approach is the fastest, but it requires the regex parser, the
// NFA compiler, the DFA builder and the DFA search runtime. That's a lot to
// bring in, but if it's available, it's (probably) the best we can do.
//
// Approaches (2) and (3) are effectively equivalent, but (2) reuses the
// data in regex-syntax and avoids duplicating it in regex-automata.
//
// Finally, (4) unconditionally returns an error since the requisite data isn't
// available anywhere.
//
// There are actually more approaches possible that we didn't implement. For
// example, if the DFA builder is available but the syntax parser is not, we
// could technically hand construct our own NFA from the 'perl_word' data
// table. But to avoid some pretty hairy code duplication, we would in turn
// need to pull the UTF-8 compiler out of the NFA compiler. Yikes.
//
// A possibly more sensible alternative is to use a lazy DFA when the full
// DFA builder isn't available...
//
// Yet another choice would be to build the full DFA and then embed it into the
// source. Then we'd only need to bring in the DFA search runtime, which is
// considerably smaller than the DFA builder code. The problem here is that the
// Debian people have spooked me[1] into avoiding cyclic dependencies. Namely,
// we'd need to build regex-cli, which depends on regex-automata in order to
// build some part of regex-automata. But to be honest, something like this has
// to be allowed somehow? I just don't know what the right process is.
//
// There are perhaps other choices as well. Why did I stop at these 4? Because
// I wanted to preserve my sanity. I suspect I'll wind up adding the lazy DFA
// approach eventually, as the benefits of the DFA approach are somewhat
// compelling. The 'boundary-words-holmes' benchmark tests this:
//
//   $ regex-cli bench measure -f boundary-words-holmes -e pikevm > dfa.csv
//
// Then I changed the code below so that the util/unicode_data/perl_word table
// was used and re-ran the benchmark:
//
//   $ regex-cli bench measure -f boundary-words-holmes -e pikevm > table.csv
//
// And compared them:
//
//   $ regex-cli bench diff dfa.csv table.csv
//   benchmark                             engine                 dfa        table
//   ---------                             ------                 ---        -----
//   internal/count/boundary-words-holmes  regex/automata/pikevm  18.6 MB/s  12.9 MB/s
//
// Which is a nice improvement.
//
// UPDATE: It turns out that it takes approximately 22ms to build the reverse
// DFA for \w. (And about 3ms for the forward DFA.) It's probably not much in
// the grand scheme things, but that is a significant latency cost. So I'm not
// sure that's a good idea. I then tried using a lazy DFA instead, and that
// eliminated the overhead, but since the lazy DFA requires mutable working
// memory, that requires introducing a 'Cache' for every simultaneous call.
//
// I ended up deciding for now to just keep the "UTF-8 decode and check the
// table." The DFA and lazy DFA approaches are still below, but commented out.
