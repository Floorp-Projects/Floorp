Version 0.5.1 (2020-05-23)
==========================

- Implement ``Default`` for traversals.
- Export ``EdgesConnecting`` publicly.
- Implement ``is_bipartite_graph``.
- Add ``FilterNode`` implementation for ``FixedBitSet`` and ``HashSet``.

Version 0.5.0 (2019-12-25)
==========================

Breaking changes
----------------

- The iterative DFS implementation, ``Dfs``, now marks nodes visited when
  they are pushed onto the stack, not when they're popped off. This may
  require changes to callers that use ``Dfs::from_parts`` or manipulate
  its internals.
- The ``IntoEdgesDirected`` trait now has a stricter contract for
  undirected graphs. Custom implementations of this trait may have to be
  updated. See the `trait documentation`__ for more.

Other changes
-------------

- Upgrade to Rust 2018 edition
- Fix clippy warnings and unify code formatting
- Improved and enhanced documentation
- Update dependencies including modern quickcheck
- Numerous bugfixes and refactorings
- Added ``MatrixGraph`` implementation

==========================

- Fix ``bellman_ford`` to work correctly with undirected graphs (#152) by
  @carrutstick
- Performance improvements for ``Graph, Stablegraph``'s ``.map()``.

Version 0.4.8 (2017-09-20)
==========================

- ``StableGraph`` learned new methods nearing parity with ``Graph``.  Note
  that the ``StableGraph`` methods preserve index stability even in the batch
  removal methods like ``filter_map`` and ``retain_edges``.

  + Added ``.filter_map()``, which maps associated node and edge data
  + Added ``.retain_edges()``, ``.edge_indices()`` and ``.clear_edges()``

- Existing ``Graph`` iterators gained some trait impls:

  + ``.node_indices(), .edge_indices()`` are ``ExactSizeIterator``
  + ``.node_references()`` is now
    ``DoubleEndedIterator + ExactSizeIterator``.
  + ``.edge_references()`` is now ``ExactSizeIterator``.

- Implemented ``From<StableGraph>`` for ``Graph``.

Version 0.4.7 (2017-09-16)
==========================

- New algorithm by @jmcomets: A* search algorithm in ``petgraph::algo::astar``
- One ``StableGraph`` bug fix whose patch was supposed to be in the previous
  version:

  + ``add_edge(m, n, _)`` now properly always panics if nodes m or n don't
    exist in the graph.

Version 0.4.6 (2017-09-12)
==========================

  for ``Graph`` and ``StableGraph`` using serde.
- Add methods ``new``, ``add_node`` to ``Csr`` by @jmcomets
- Add indexing with ``[]`` by node index, ``NodeCompactIndexable`` for
  ``Csr`` by @jmcomets

- Add implementation of ``From<Graph>`` for ``StableGraph``.
- Add implementation of ``IntoNodeReferences`` for ``&StableGraph``.
- Add method ``StableGraph::map`` that maps associated data
- Add method ``StableGraph::find_edge_undirected``
- Many ``StableGraph`` bug fixes involving node vacancies (holes left by
  deletions):

  + ``neighbors(n)`` and similar neighbor and edge iterator methods now
    handle n being a vacancy properly. (This produces an empty iterator.)
  + ``find_edge(m, n)`` now handles m being a vacancy correctly too
  + ``StableGraph::node_bound`` was fixed for empty graphs and returns 0

- Add implementation of ``DoubleEndedIterator`` to ``Graph, StableGraph``'s
  edge references iterators.
- Debug output for ``Graph`` now shows node and edge count. ``Graph, StableGraph``
  show nothing for the edges list if it's empty (no label).
- ``Arbitrary`` implementation for ``StableGraph`` now can produce graphs with
  vacancies (used by quickcheck)

==========================

- Move the ``visit.rs`` file due to changed rules for a moduleâ€™s directory
  ownership in Rust, resolving a future compat warning.
- The error types ``Cycle, NegativeCycle`` now implement ``PartialEq``.

Version 0.4.1 (2016-10-26)
==========================

  graph.

Version 0.4.0 (2016-10-17)
==========================

Breaking changes in ``Graph``
-----------------------------

- ``Graph::edges`` and the other edges methods now return an iterator of
  edge references

Other breaking changes
----------------------

- ``toposort`` now returns an error if the graph had a cycle.
- ``is_cyclic_directed`` no longer takes a dfs space argument. It is
  now recursive.
- ``scc`` was renamed to ``kosaraju_scc``.
- ``min_spanning_tree`` now returns an iterator that needs to be
  made into a specific graph type deliberately.
- ``dijkstra`` now uses the ``IntoEdges`` trait.
- ``NodeIndexable`` changed its method signatures.
- ``IntoExternals`` was removed, and many other smaller adjustments
  in graph traits. ``NodeId`` must now implement ``PartialEq``, for example.
- ``DfsIter, BfsIter`` were removed in favour of a more general approach
  with the ``Walker`` trait and its iterator conversion.

New features
------------

- New graph traits, for example ``IntoEdges`` which returns
  an iterator of edge references. Everything implements the graph traits
  much more consistently.
- Traits for associated data access and building graphs: ``DataMap``,
  ``Build, Create, FromElements``.

- New algorithms: bellman-ford

- ``GraphMap`` implements ``NodeIndexable``.

    finishing and edge classification events.
  - Add graph adaptor ``Filtered``.
  - impl ``Debug, NodeIndexable`` for ``Reversed``.

Version 0.3.1 (2016-10-05)
==========================

- Add ``.edges(), .edges_directed()`` to ``StableGraph``. Note that these
  differ from ``Graph``, because this is the signature they will all use
  in the future.
- Add ``.update_edge()`` to ``StableGraph``.
- Add reexports of common items in ``stable_graph`` module (for example
  ``NodeIndex``).
- Minor performance improvements to graph iteration
- Improved docs for ``visit`` module.

Version 0.3.0 (2016-10-03)
==========================

- Overhaul all graph visitor traits so that they use the ``IntoIterator``
  style. This makes them composable.

  - Multiple graph algorithms use new visitor traits.
  - **Help is welcome to port more algorithms (and create new graph traits in
    the process)!**

- ``GraphMap`` can now have directed edges. ``GraphMap::new`` is now generic
  in the edge type. ``DiGraphMap`` and ``UnGraphMap`` are new type aliases.

- ``GraphMap`` is based on the indexmap crate. Deterministic iteration
  order, faster iteration, no side tables needed to convert to ``Graph``.

- Optional graph visitor workspace reuse in ``has_path_connecting``,
  ``is_cyclic_directed, toposort``.
- Improved ``Debug`` formatting for ``Graph, StableGraph``.
- Add a prelude module
- ``GraphMap`` now has a method ``.into_graph()`` that makes a ``Graph``.
- ``Graph::retain_nodes, retain_edges`` now expose the self graph only
  as wrapped in ``Frozen``, so that weights can be mutated but the
  graph structure not.
- Enable ``StableGraph`` by default
- Add method ``Graph::contains_edge``.
- Renamed ``EdgeDirection`` â†’ ``Direction``.
- Remove ``SubTopo``.
- Require Rust 1.12 or later
