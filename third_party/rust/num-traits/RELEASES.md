- Clarify the license specification as "MIT OR Apache-2.0".

# Release 0.2.13 (2020-10-29)

- [The new `OverflowingAdd`, `OverflowingSub`, and `OverflowingMul` traits][180]
  return a tuple with the operation result and a `bool` indicating overflow.
- [The "i128" feature now overrides compiler probes for that support][185].
  This may fix scenarios where `autocfg` probing doesn't work properly.
- [Casts from large `f64` values to `f32` now saturate to infinity][186]. They
  previously returned `None` because that was once thought to be undefined
  behavior, but [rust#15536] resolved that such casts are fine.
- [`Num::from_str_radix` documents requirements for radix support][192], which
  are now more relaxed than previously implied. It is suggested to accept at
  least `2..=36` without panicking, but `Err` may be returned otherwise.

# Release 0.2.12 (2020-06-11)

- [The new `WrappingNeg` trait][153] will wrap the result if it exceeds the
  boundary of the type, e.g. `i32::MIN.wrapping_neg() == i32::MIN`.
- [The new `SaturatingAdd`, `SaturatingSub`, and `SaturatingMul` traits][165]
  will saturate at the numeric bounds if the operation would overflow. These
  soft-deprecate the existing `Saturating` trait that only has addition and
  subtraction methods.
- [Added new constants for logarithms, `FloatConst::{LOG10_2, LOG2_10}`][171].

  while preserving input `NAN`s.

- Miscellaneous documentation updates.

# Release 0.2.7 (2019-05-20)

- [Documented when `CheckedShl` and `CheckedShr` return `None`][90].
- [The new `Zero::set_zero` and `One::set_one`][104] will set values to their
  identities in place, possibly optimized better than direct assignment.
- [Documented general features and intentions of `PrimInt`][108].

# Release 0.2.6 (2018-09-13)

- [Documented that `pow(0, 0)` returns `1`][79].  Mathematically, this is not
  strictly defined, but the current behavior is a pragmatic choice that has
  precedent in Rust `core` for the primitives and in many other languages.
- [The new `WrappingShl` and `WrappingShr` traits][81] will wrap the shift count
  if it exceeds the bit size of the type.

# Release 0.2.5 (2018-06-20)

- [The default methods in `FromPrimitive` and `ToPrimitive` are more robust.][73]

# Release 0.2.4 (2018-05-11)

- [Support for 128-bit integers is now automatically detected and enabled.][69]
  Setting the `i128` crate feature now causes the build script to panic if such
  support is not detected.

**Contributors**: @cuviper

[69]: https://github.com/rust-num/num-traits/pull/69

# Release 0.2.3 (2018-05-10)

- [The new `CheckedNeg` and `CheckedRem` traits][63] perform checked `Neg` and
  `Rem`, returning `Some(output)` or `None` on overflow.
- [The `no_std` implementation of `FloatCore::to_degrees` for `f32`][61] now
  uses a constant for greater accuracy, mirroring [rust#47919].  (With `std` it
  just calls the inherent `f32::to_degrees` in the standard library.)
- [The new `MulAdd` and `MulAddAssign` traits][59] perform a fused multiply-
  add.  For integer types this is just a convenience, but for floating point
  types this produces a more accurate result than the separate operations.
- [All applicable traits are now implemented for 128-bit integers][60] starting
  with Rust 1.26, enabled by the new `i128` crate feature.  The `FromPrimitive`
  and `ToPrimitive` traits now also have corresponding 128-bit methods, which
  default to converting via 64-bit integers for compatibility.

# Release 0.2.2 (2018-03-18)

- [Casting from floating point to integers now returns `None` on overflow][52],
  avoiding [rustc's undefined behavior][rust-10184]. This applies to the `cast`
  function and the traits `NumCast`, `FromPrimitive`, and `ToPrimitive`.

# Release 0.2.1 (2018-03-01)

- [The new `FloatCore` trait][32] offers a subset of `Float` for `#![no_std]` use.
  [This includes everything][41] except the transcendental functions and FMA.
- [The new `Inv` trait][37] returns the multiplicative inverse, or reciprocal.
- [The new `Pow` trait][37] performs exponentiation, much like the existing `pow`
  function, but with generic exponent types.
- [The new `One::is_one` method][39] tests if a value equals 1.  Implementers
  should override this method if there's a more efficient way to check for 1,
  rather than comparing with a temporary `one()`.

# Release 0.2.0 (2018-02-06)

- **breaking change**: [There is now a `std` feature][30], enabled by default, along
  with the implication that building *without* this feature makes this a
  `#![no_std]` crate.
  - The `Float` and `Real` traits are only available when `std` is enabled.
  - Otherwise, the API is unchanged, and num-traits 0.1.43 now re-exports its
    items from num-traits 0.2 for compatibility (the [semver-trick]).

# Release 0.1.43 (2018-02-06)

- All items are now [re-exported from num-traits 0.2][31] for compatibility.

[31]: https://github.com/rust-num/num-traits/pull/31


# Release 0.1.42 (2018-01-22)

- [num-traits now has its own source repository][num-356] at [rust-num/num-traits][home].
- [`ParseFloatError` now implements `Display`][22].
- [The new `AsPrimitive` trait][17] implements generic casting with the `as` operator.
- [The new `CheckedShl` and `CheckedShr` traits][21] implement generic
  support for the `checked_shl` and `checked_shr` methods on primitive integers.
- [The new `Real` trait][23] offers a subset of `Float` functionality that may be applicable to more
  types, with a blanket implementation for all existing `T: Float` types.
