/// Represents an error that occured within rust, storing both an error code, and additional data
/// that may be used by the caller.
///
/// Misuse of this type can cause numerous issues, so please read the entire documentation before
/// usage.
///
/// ## Rationale
///
/// This library encourages a pattern of taking a `&mut ExternError` as the final parameter for
/// functions exposed over the FFI. This is an "out parameter" which we use to write error/success
/// information that occurred during the function's execution.
///
/// To be clear, this means instances of `ExternError` will be created on the other side of the FFI,
/// and passed (by mutable reference) into Rust.
///
/// While this pattern is not particularly ergonomic in Rust (although hopefully this library
/// helps!), it offers two main benefits over something more ergonomic (which might be `Result`
/// shaped).
///
/// 1. It avoids defining a large number of `Result`-shaped types in the FFI consumer, as would
///    be required with something like an `struct ExternResult<T> { ok: *mut T, err:... }`
///
/// 2. It offers additional type safety over `struct ExternResult { ok: *mut c_void, err:... }`,
///    which helps avoid memory safety errors. It also can offer better performance for returning
///    primitives and repr(C) structs (no boxing required).
///
/// It also is less tricky to use properly than giving consumers a `get_last_error()` function, or
/// similar.
///
/// ## Caveats
///
/// Note that the order of the fields is `code` (an i32) then `message` (a `*mut c_char`), getting
/// this wrong on the other side of the FFI will cause memory corruption and crashes.
///
/// The fields are public largely for documentation purposes, but you should use
/// [`ExternError::new_error`] or [`ExternError::success`] to create these.
///
/// ## Layout/fields
///
/// This struct's field are not `pub` (mostly so that we can soundly implement `Send`, but also so
/// that we can verify rust users are constructing them appropriately), the fields, their types, and
/// their order are *very much* a part of the public API of this type. Consumers on the other side
/// of the FFI will need to know its layout.
///
/// If this were a C struct, it would look like
///
/// ```c,no_run
/// struct ExternError {
///     int32_t code;
///     char *message; // note: nullable
/// };
/// ```
///
/// In rust, there are two fields, in this order: `code: ErrorCode`, and `message: *mut c_char`.
/// Note that ErrorCode is a `#[repr(transparent)]` wrapper around an `i32`, so the first property
/// is equivalent to an `i32`.
///
/// #### The `code` field.
///
/// This is the error code, 0 represents success, all other values represent failure. If the `code`
/// field is nonzero, there should always be a message, and if it's zero, the message will always be
/// null.
///
/// #### The `message` field.
///
/// This isÂ a null-terminated C string containing some amount of additional information about the
/// error. If the `code` property is nonzero, there should always be an error message. Otherwise,
/// this should will be null.
///
/// This string (when not null) is allocated on the rust heap (using this crate's
/// [`rust_string_to_c`]), and must be freed on it as well. Critically, if there are multiple rust
/// packages using being used in the same application, it *must be freed on the same heap that
/// allocated it*, or you will corrupt both heaps.
///
/// Typically, this object is managed on the other side of the FFI (on the "FFI consumer"), which
/// means you must expose a function to release the resources of `message` which can be done easily
/// using the [`define_string_destructor!`] macro provided by this crate.
///
/// If, for some reason, you need to release the resources directly, you may call
/// `ExternError::release()`. Note that you probably do not need to do this, and it's
/// intentional that this is not called automatically by implementing `drop`.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use ffi_support::{ExternError, ErrorCode};
///
/// #[derive(Debug)]
/// pub enum MyError {
///     IllegalFoo(String),
///     InvalidBar(i64),
///     // ...
/// }
///
/// // Putting these in a module is obviously optional, but it allows documentation, and helps
/// // avoid accidental reuse.
/// pub mod error_codes {
///     // note: -1 and 0 are reserved by ffi_support
///     pub const ILLEGAL_FOO: i32 = 1;
///     pub const INVALID_BAR: i32 = 2;
///     // ...
/// }
///
/// fn get_code(e: &MyError) -> ErrorCode {
///     match e {
///         MyError::IllegalFoo(_) => ErrorCode::new(error_codes::ILLEGAL_FOO),
///         MyError::InvalidBar(_) => ErrorCode::new(error_codes::INVALID_BAR),
///         // ...
///     }
/// }
///
/// impl From<MyError> for ExternError {
///     fn from(e: MyError) -> ExternError {
///         ExternError::new_error(get_code(&e), format!("{:?}", e))
///     }
/// }
