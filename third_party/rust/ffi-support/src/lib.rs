//! # FFI Support
//!
//! This crate implements a support library to simplify implementing the patterns that the
//! `mozilla/application-services` repository uses for it's "Rust Component" FFI libraries.
//!
//! It is *strongly encouraged* that anybody writing FFI code in this repository read this
//! documentation before doing so, as it is a subtle, difficult, and error prone process.
//!
//! ## Terminology
//!
//! For each library, there are currently three parts we're concerned with. There's no clear correct
//! name for these, so this documentation will attempt to use the following terminology:
//!
//! - **Rust Component**: A Rust crate which does not expose an FFI directly, but may be may be
//!   wrapped by one that does. These have a `crate-type` in their Cargo.toml (see
//!   https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html) of `lib`, and not `staticlib` or `cdylib`
//!   (Note that `lib` is the default if `crate-type` is not specified). Examples include the
//!   `fxa-client`, and `logins` crates.
//!
//! - **FFI Component**: A wrapper crate that takes a Rust component, and exposes an FFI from it.
//!   These typically have `ffi` in the name, and have `crate-type = ["lib", "staticlib", "cdylib"]`
//!   in their Cargo.toml. For example, the `fxa-client/ffi` and `logins/ffi` crates (note:
//!   paths are subject to change). When built, these produce a native library that is consumed by
//!   the "FFI Consumer".
//!
//! - **FFI Consumer**: This is a low level library, typically implemented in Kotlin (for Android)
//!   or Swift (for iOS), that exposes a memory-safe wrapper around the memory-unsafe C API produced
//!   by the FFI component. It's expected that the maintainers of the FFI Component and FFI Consumer
//!   be the same (or at least, the author of the consumer should be completely comfortable with the
//!   API exposed by, and code in the FFI component), since the code in these is extremely tightly
//!   coupled, and very easy to get wrong.
//!
//! Note that while there are three parts, there may be more than three libraries relevant here, for
//! example there may be more than one FFI consumer (one for Android, one for iOS).
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! This library will typically be used in both the Rust component, and the FFI component, however
//! it frequently will be an optional dependency in the Rust component that's only available when a
//! feature flagÂ (which the FFI component will always require) is used.
//!
//! The reason it's required inside the Rust component (and not solely in the FFI component, which
//! would be nice), is so that types provided by that crate may implement the traits provided by
//! this crate (this is because Rust does not allow crate `C` to implement a trait defined in crate
//! `A` for a type defined in crate `B`).
//!
//! In general, examples should be provided for the most important types and functions
//! ([`call_with_result`], [`IntoFfi`],
//! [`ExternError`], etc), but you should also look at the code of
//! consumers of this library.
//!
//! ### Usage in the Rust Component
//!
//! Inside the Rust component, you will implement:
//!
//! 1. [`IntoFfi`] for all types defined in that crate that you want to return
//!    over the FFI. For most common cases, the [`implement_into_ffi_by_json!`] and
//!    [`implement_into_ffi_by_protobuf!`] macros will do the job here, however you
//!    can see that trait's documentation for discussion and examples of
//!    implementing it manually.
//!
//! 2. Conversion to [`ExternError`] for the error type(s) exposed by that
//!    rust component, that is, `impl From<MyError> for ExternError`.
//!
//! ### Usage in the FFI Component
//!
//! Inside the FFI component, you will use this library in a few ways:
//!
//! 1. Destructors will be exposed for each types that had [`implement_into_ffi_by_pointer!`] called
//!    on it (using [`define_box_destructor!`]), and a destructor for strings should be exposed as
//!    well, using [`define_string_destructor`]
//!
//! 2. The body of every / nearly every FFI function will be wrapped in either a
//!    [`call_with_result`] or [`call_with_output`].
//!
//!    This is required because if we `panic!` (e.g. from an `assert!`, `unwrap()`, `expect()`, from
//!    indexing past the end of an array, etc) across the FFI boundary, the behavior is undefined
//!    and in practice very weird things tend to happen (we aren't caught by the caller, since they
//!    don't have the same exception behavior as us).
//!
//!    If you don't think your program (or possibly just certain calls) can handle panics, you may
//!    also use the versions of these functions in the [`abort_on_panic`] module, which
//!    do as their name suggest.
//!
//! Additionally, c strings that are passed in as arguments may be represented using [`FfiStr`],
//! which contains several helpful inherent methods for extracting their data.
//!

/// ByteBuffer is a struct that represents an array of bytes to be sent over the FFI boundaries.
/// There are several cases when you might want to use this, but the primary one for us
/// is for returning protobuf-encoded data to Swift and Java. The type is currently rather
/// limited (implementing almost no functionality), however in the future it may be
/// more expanded.
///
/// ## Caveats
///
/// Note that the order of the fields is `len` (an i64) then `data` (a `*mut u8`), getting
/// this wrong on the other side of the FFI will cause memory corruption and crashes.
/// `i64` is used for the length instead of `u64` and `usize` because JNA has interop
/// issues with both these types.
///
/// ### `Drop` is not implemented
///
/// ByteBuffer does not implement Drop. This is intentional. Memory passed into it will
/// be leaked if it is not explicitly destroyed by calling [`ByteBuffer::destroy`], or
/// [`ByteBuffer::destroy_into_vec`]. This is for two reasons:
///
/// 1. In the future, we may allow it to be used for data that is not managed by
///    the Rust allocator\*, and `ByteBuffer` assuming it's okay to automatically
///    deallocate this data with the Rust allocator.
///
/// 2. Automatically running destructors in unsafe code is a
///    [frequent footgun](https://without.boats/blog/two-memory-bugs-from-ringbahn/)
///    (among many similar issues across many crates).
///
/// Note that calling `destroy` manually is often not needed, as usually you should
/// be passing these to the function defined by [`define_bytebuffer_destructor!`] from
/// the other side of the FFI.
///
/// Because this type is essentially *only* useful in unsafe or FFI code (and because
/// the most common usage pattern does not require manually managing the memory), it
/// does not implement `Drop`.
///
/// \* Note: in the case of multiple Rust shared libraries loaded at the same time,
/// there may be multiple instances of "the Rust allocator" (one per shared library),
/// in which case we're referring to whichever instance is active for the code using
/// the `ByteBuffer`. Note that this doesn't occur on all platforms or build
/// configurations, but treating allocators in different shared libraries as fully
/// independent is always safe.
///
/// ## Layout/fields
///
/// This struct's field are not `pub` (mostly so that we can soundly implement `Send`, but also so
/// that we can verify rust users are constructing them appropriately), the fields, their types, and
/// their order are *very much* a part of the public API of this type. Consumers on the other side
/// of the FFI will need to know its layout.
///
/// If this were a C struct, it would look like
///
/// ```c,no_run
/// struct ByteBuffer {
///     // Note: This should never be negative, but values above
///     // INT64_MAX / i64::MAX are not allowed.
///     int64_t len;
///     // Note: nullable!
///     uint8_t *data;
/// };
/// ```
///
/// In rust, there are two fields, in this order: `len: i64`, and `data: *mut u8`.
///
/// For clarity, the fact that the data pointer is nullable means that `Option<ByteBuffer>` is not
/// the same size as ByteBuffer, and additionally is not FFI-safe (the latter point is not
/// currently guaranteed anyway as of the time of writing this comment).
///
/// ### Description of fields
///
/// `data` is a pointer to an array of `len` bytes. Note that data can be a null pointer and therefore
/// should be checked.
///
/// The bytes array is allocated on the heap and must be freed on it as well. Critically, if there
/// are multiple rust shared libraries using being used in the same application, it *must be freed
/// on the same heap that allocated it*, or you will corrupt both heaps.
///
/// Typically, this object is managed on the other side of the FFI (on the "FFI consumer"), which
/// means you must expose a function to release the resources of `data` which can be done easily
/// using the [`define_bytebuffer_destructor!`] macro provided by this crate.
