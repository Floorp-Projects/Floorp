//! A key part of the lane-table algorithm is the idea of a CONTEXT
//! SET (my name, the paper has no name for this). Basically it
//! represents the LR1 context under which a given conflicting action
//! would take place.
//!
//! So, for example, imagine this grammar:
//!
//! ```notrust
//! A = B x
//!   | C y
//! B = z
//! C = z
//! ```
//!
//! This gives rise to states like:
//!
//! - `S0 = { * B x, * C y, B = * z, C = * z }`
//! - `S1 = { B = z *, C = z * }`
//!
//! This second state has two conflicting items. Let's call them
//! conflicts 0 and 1 respectively. The conflict set would then have
//! two entries (one for each conflict) and it would map each of them
//! to a TokenSet supplying context. So when we trace everything
//! out we might get a ContextSet of:
//!
//! - `[ 0: x, 1: y ]`
//!
//! In general, you want to ensure that the token sets of all
//! conflicting items are pairwise-disjoint, or else if you get to a
//! state that has both of those items (which, by definition, does
//! arise) you won't know which to take. In this case, we're all set,
//! because item 0 occurs only with lookahead `x` and item 1 with
//! lookahead `y`.
