# Structured Field Values for HTTP

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/sfv/)

`sfv` crate is an implementation of IETF draft [Structured Field Values for HTTP](https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-header-structure.html) for parsing and serializing HTTP field values (also known as "structured headers" or "structured trailers").

It also exposes a set of types that might be useful for defining new structured fields.
