//! Unsafe `ioctl` API.
//!
//! Unix systems expose a number of `ioctl`'s. `ioctl`s have been adopted as a
//! general purpose system call for making calls into the kernel. In addition
//! to the wide variety of system calls that are included by default in the
//! kernel, many drivers expose their own `ioctl`'s for controlling their
//! behavior, some of which are proprietary. Therefore it is impossible to make
//! a safe interface for every `ioctl` call, as they all have wildly varying
//! semantics.
//!
//! This module provides an unsafe interface to write your own `ioctl` API. To
//! start, create a type that implements [`Ioctl`]. Then, pass it to [`ioctl`]
//! to make the `ioctl` call.

/// `ioctl` was originally intended to act as a way of modifying the behavior
/// of files, but has since been adopted as a general purpose system call for
/// making calls into the kernel. In addition to the default calls exposed by
/// generic file descriptors, many drivers expose their own `ioctl` calls for
/// controlling their behavior, some of which are proprietary.
///
/// This crate exposes many other `ioctl` interfaces with safe and idiomatic
/// wrappers, like [`ioctl_fionbio`](crate::io::ioctl_fionbio) and
/// [`ioctl_fionread`](crate::io::ioctl_fionread). It is recommended to use
/// those instead of this function, as they are safer and more idiomatic.
/// For other cases, implement the [`Ioctl`] API and pass it to this function.
///
/// See documentation for [`Ioctl`] for more information.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// While [`Ioctl`] takes much of the unsafety out of `ioctl` calls, it is
/// still unsafe to call this code with arbitrary device drivers, as it is up
/// to the device driver to implement the `ioctl` call correctly. It is on the
/// onus of the protocol between the user and the driver to ensure that the
/// `ioctl` call is safe to make.

/// A trait defining the properties of an `ioctl` command.

/// Objects implementing this trait can be passed to [`ioctl`] to make an
/// `ioctl` call. The contents of the object represent the inputs to the
/// `ioctl` call. The inputs must be convertible to a pointer through the
/// `as_ptr` method. In most cases, this involves either casting a number to
/// a pointer, or creating a pointer to the actual data. The latter case is
/// necessary for `ioctl` calls that modify userspace data.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// This trait is unsafe to implement because it is impossible to guarantee
/// that the `ioctl` call is safe. The `ioctl` call may be proprietary, or it
/// may be unsafe to call in certain circumstances.
///
/// By implementing this trait, you guarantee that:
///
/// - The `ioctl` call expects the input provided by `as_ptr` and produces the
///   output as indicated by `output`.
/// - That `output_from_ptr` can safely take the pointer from `as_ptr` and cast
///   it to the correct type, *only* after the `ioctl` call.
/// - That `OPCODE` uniquely identifies the `ioctl` call.
/// - That, for whatever platforms you are targeting, the `ioctl` call is safe
///   to make.
/// - If `IS_MUTATING` is false, that no userspace data will be modified by the
///   `ioctl` call.
