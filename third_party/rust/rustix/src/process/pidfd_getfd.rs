/// This function is generally safe for the calling process, but it can impact
/// the target process in unexpected ways. If you want to ensure that Rust I/O
/// safety assumptions continue to hold in the target process, then the target
/// process must have communicated the file description number to the calling
/// process from a value of a type that implements `AsRawFd`, and the target
/// process must not drop that value until after the calling process has
/// returned from `pidfd_getfd`.
///
/// When `pidfd_getfd` is used to debug the target, or the target is not a Rust
/// aplication, or `pidfd_getfd` is used in any other way, then extra care
/// should be taken to avoid unexpected behaviour or crashes.
///
/// For further details, see the references above.
