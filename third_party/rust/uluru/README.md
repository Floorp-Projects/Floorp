# uluru

A simple, fast, least-recently-used (LRU) cache implementation used for
Servo's style system.

`LRUCache` uses a fixed-capacity array for storage. It provides `O(1)`
insertion, and `O(n)` lookup.  It does not require an allocator and can be
used in `no_std` crates.  It is implemented in 100% safe Rust.
