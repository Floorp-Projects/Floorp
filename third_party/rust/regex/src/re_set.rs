/// Match multiple (possibly overlapping) regular expressions in a single scan.
///
/// A regex set corresponds to the union of two or more regular expressions.
/// That is, a regex set will match text where at least one of its
/// constituent regular expressions matches. A regex set as its formulated here
/// provides a touch more power: it will also report *which* regular
/// expressions in the set match. Indeed, this is the key difference between
/// regex sets and a single `Regex` with many alternates, since only one
/// alternate can match at a time.
///
/// For example, consider regular expressions to match email addresses and
/// domains: `[a-z]+@[a-z]+\.(com|org|net)` and `[a-z]+\.(com|org|net)`. If a
/// regex set is constructed from those regexes, then searching the text
/// `foo@example.com` will report both regexes as matching. Of course, one
/// could accomplish this by compiling each regex on its own and doing two
/// searches over the text. The key advantage of using a regex set is that it
/// will report the matching regexes using a *single pass through the text*.
/// If one has hundreds or thousands of regexes to match repeatedly (like a URL
/// router for a complex web application or a user agent matcher), then a regex
/// set can realize huge performance gains.
///
/// # Example
///
/// This shows how the above two regexes (for matching email addresses and
/// domains) might work:
///
$(#[$doc_regexset_example])*
///
/// Note that it would be possible to adapt the above example to using `Regex`
/// with an expression like:
///
/// ```text
/// (?P<email>[a-z]+@(?P<email_domain>[a-z]+[.](com|org|net)))|(?P<domain>[a-z]+[.](com|org|net))
/// ```
///
/// After a match, one could then inspect the capture groups to figure out
/// which alternates matched. The problem is that it is hard to make this
/// approach scale when there are many regexes since the overlap between each
/// alternate isn't always obvious to reason about.
///
/// # Limitations
///
/// Regex sets are limited to answering the following two questions:
///
/// 1. Does any regex in the set match?
/// 2. If so, which regexes in the set match?
///
/// As with the main `Regex` type, it is cheaper to ask (1) instead of (2)
/// since the matching engines can stop after the first match is found.
///
/// Other features like finding the location of successive matches or their
/// sub-captures aren't supported. If you need this functionality, the
/// recommended approach is to compile each regex in the set independently and
/// selectively match them based on which regexes in the set matched.
///
/// # Performance
///
/// A `RegexSet` has the same performance characteristics as `Regex`. Namely,
/// search takes `O(mn)` time, where `m` is proportional to the size of the
/// regex set and `n` is proportional to the length of the search text.
