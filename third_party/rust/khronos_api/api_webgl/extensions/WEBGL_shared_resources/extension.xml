    <p>
      This extension exposes the ability to share WebGL resources with multiple WebGLRenderingContexts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Background:
    </p>
    <p>
      The OpenGL ES spec defines that you can share a resource (texture, buffer, shader, program,
      renderbuffer) with 2 or more GL contexts but with some caveats. To guarantee you'll see a
      change made in one context in other context requires calling glFinish on the context that
      made the change and call glBind on the context that wants to see the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not calling glFinish and/or glBind does not guarantee you won't see the results which means
      that users may do neither and their app might just happen to work on some platforms and
      mysteriously have glitches, rendering corruption, gl errors or program failure on others.
    </p>
    <p>
      WebGL must present consistent behavior for sharing and so this extension provides
      an API so that implementions can enforce and optimize these requirements.
    </p>

      <feature>
        <p>Adds a new context creation parameter:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><span class="prop-value">shareGroup</span></dt>
                <dd>
                    <em>Default: undefined</em>. If the value is set to the <code>group</code>
                    attribute from the <code>WEBGL_shared_resources</code> object from an existing context
                    then resources from the existing context are shared with the newly created context.
                </dd>
        </dl>
        <pre class="example">
var canvas1 = document.createElement("canvas");
var canvas2 = document.createElement("canvas");
var ctx1 = canvas1.getContext("webgl");
var sharedResourcesExtension = ctx1.getExtension("WEBGL_shared_resources");
var ctx2 = canvas2.getContext("webgl", {
    shareGroup: sharedResourcesExtension.group
});
        </pre>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <p>
        In order for a context to use a resouce it must first acquire it.
        Contexts can make a request to acquire a resource by calling acquireSharedResource
        in one of 2 modes, EXCLUSIVE or READ_ONLY. A resource may be acquired by multiple
        contexts in READ_ONLY mode. The resource may only be acquired by one context
        if the mode is EXCLUSIVE. acquireSharedResource returns an id you can use to cancel the acquire
        by calling cancelAcquireSharedResource.
        When the resource is available in the requested mode the callback
        will be invoked. Resources start their life as acquired in EXCLUSIVE mode in the context
        in which they are created.
        </p>
        <p>
        To release a resource so it may be acquired by another context call releaseSharedResource and
        pass it the resource to be released.
        </p>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <p>
        After a resource is acquired it must be bound before it is used. Binding
        means for buffers calling bindBuffer, for textures either bindTexture or
        framebufferTexture2D, for renderbuffers either bindRenderbuffer or framebufferRenderbuffer,
        for shaders attachShader, for programs useProgram. Binding once is sufficient to satisfy
        this requirement. In other words, if you have a texture attached to more than one texture
        unit the texture only needs to be re-bound to 1 texture unit.  Attemping to use a resource
        which has not been bound since it was acquired generates INVALID_OPERATION.
        </p>
        <p>
        Bind Requirement Algorithm:
        </p>
        <p>
        Each resource has a per-context bound flag. When a resource is acquired in a context its
        bound flag for that context is set to false. If one of the functions listed above
        is called the bound flag for that context is set to true. Drawing and reading functions,
        clear, drawArrays, drawElements, readPixels, that would access a resource whose bound flag
        for that context is false generate INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION. All other functions that
        use a resource whose bound flag for that context is false generate INVALID_OPERATION.
        </p>
        <p>
        Note: In the specific case of programs, it is not an error to call draw with a program
        or call useProgram for a program which has shaders that have
        been acquired but not re-attached. Nor it is an error to draw with or call useProgram
        for a program which has shaders that have not been acquired.  It is an error to call linkProgram
        for a program that is using shaders that have been acquired but not re-attached.
        </p>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <p>
        When an attempt is made to use a resource that is not acquired in the current context
        the implementation must generate the error INVALID_OPERATION or INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPRATION.
        This includes all gl calls
        that would access the given resource directly or indirectly. For example, a
        draw call must fail if any of the resources it would access is not acquired in the
        correct mode for the call. In other words, if the draw call would read from a buffer
        or texture and that buffer or texture is not acquired for READ_ONLY or EXCLUSIVE mode the draw
        must fail with INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION. If the draw would render to a texture or renderbuffer
        that is not acquired for EXCLUSIVE mode the draw must fail and generate INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION.
        If a program used in the draw is not acquired for READ_ONLY or EXCLUSIVE mode the draw or clear must fail
        and generate INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION.

        The term "not limited to" is intended to point out that extension may enable
        other functions to which these rule should apply. For example drawArraysInstancedANGLE
        must follow the same rules as drawArrays.

          Calling checkFramebufferStatus with the argument FRAMEBUFFER or DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER must
          return FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_ATTACHMENT if any of the resources referenced by the currently
          bound framebuffer are not acquired for EXCLUSIVE access.
          Calling checkFramebufferStatus with the argument READ_FRAMEBUFFER will return
          FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_ATTACHMENT if any of the resources referenced by the currently bound
          framebuffer are not acquired for EXCLUSIVE or READ_ONLY access.
          </p>
          <p>
          Note: This extension exposes the constants READ_FRAMEBUFFER and DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER only for
          the purpose of calling checkFramebufferStatus. In particular, this extension does not enable
          calling bindFramebuffer with either constant.

          <p>
          A context that is deleted automatically releases all resources it has acquired. Note that
          currently there is no way to explicitly delete a context. Contexts are deleted through
          garbage collection.
          </p>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <p>
         Note that implementing this extension changes the base class of the sharable resources.
         Specifically: WebGLBuffer, WebGLProgram, WebGLRenderbuffer, WebGLShader, and WebGLTexture
         change their base class from WebGLObject to WebGLSharedObject.

              Q: What happens if one context deletes a resource another context is attempting to acquire?
          </div>
          <div>
              A: Nothing special. The acquire will succeed when the context that currently has the resource
              releases it. The context that acquires the resource can use the WebGLSharedObject
              (buffer, texture, etc...) and will get the normal WebGL behavior associated with using
              a deleted resource.

          <div>
              A: No. An attachment can remain attached while it is released but it must be acquired
                 when attaching.
                 In particular a framebuffer attachment may not be attached to a framebuffer unless
                 the attachment is acquired. A shader may not be attached to a program unless the
                 shader is acquired. A buffer may not be attached to an attibute, vertexAttribPointer,
                 unless the buffer is acquired.
