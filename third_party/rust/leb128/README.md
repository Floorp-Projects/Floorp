[![](http://meritbadge.herokuapp.com/leb128) ![](https://img.shields.io/crates/d/leb128.png)](https://crates.io/crates/leb128) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gimli-rs/leb128.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gimli-rs/leb128) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/gimli-rs/leb128/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/gimli-rs/leb128?branch=master)

Read and write DWARF's "Little Endian Base 128" (LEB128) variable length integer
encoding.

The implementation is a direct translation of the pseudocode in the DWARF 4
standard's appendix C.

## Install

Either

    $ cargo add leb128

or add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

    [dependencies]
    leb128 = "0.2.1"

## Example

```rust
use leb128;

let mut buf = [0; 1024];

// Write to anything that implements `std::io::Write`.
{
    let mut writable = &mut buf[..];
    leb128::write::signed(&mut writable, -12345).expect("Should write number");
}

// Read from anything that implements `std::io::Read`.
let mut readable = &buf[..];
let val = leb128::read::signed(&mut readable).expect("Should read number");
assert_eq!(val, -12345);
```

## Read-Eval-Print-Loop for LEB128

This crate comes with a `leb128-repl` program that you can use after `cargo
install leb128` or by running `cargo run` in clone of this repository.

```
$ leb128-repl
LEB128 Read-Eval-Print-Loop!

Converts numbers to signed and unsigned LEB128 and displays the results in
base-10, hex, and binary.
