utf8_iter provides iteration by `char` over potentially-invalid UTF-8 `&[u8]`
such that UTF-8 errors are handled according to the WHATWG Encoding Standard.

Key parts of the code are copypaste from the UTF-8 to UTF-16 conversion code
in `encoding_rs`, which was optimized for speed in the case of valid input.
The implementation here uses the structure that was found to be fast in the
`encoding_rs` context but the structure hasn't been benchmarked in this
context.

This is a `no_std` crate.
