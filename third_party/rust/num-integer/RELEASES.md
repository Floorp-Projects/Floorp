# Release 0.1.44 (2020-10-29)

- [The "i128" feature now bypasses compiler probing][35]. The build script
  used to probe anyway and panic if requested support wasn't found, but
  sometimes this ran into bad corner cases with `autocfg`.

# Release 0.1.43 (2020-06-11)

- [The new `Average` trait][31] computes fast integer averages, rounded up or
  down, without any risk of overflow.

# Release 0.1.42 (2020-01-09)

- [Updated the `autocfg` build dependency to 1.0][29].

# Release 0.1.40 (2019-05-20)

- [Optimized primitive `gcd` by avoiding memory swaps][11].
- [Fixed `lcm(0, 0)` to return `0`, rather than panicking][18].
- [Added `Integer::div_ceil`, `next_multiple_of`, and `prev_multiple_of`][16].
- [Added `Integer::gcd_lcm`, `extended_gcd`, and `extended_gcd_lcm`][19].

# Release 0.1.39 (2018-06-20)

- [The new `Roots` trait provides `sqrt`, `cbrt`, and `nth_root` methods][9],
  calculating an `Integer`'s principal roots rounded toward zero.

# Release 0.1.38 (2018-05-11)

- [Support for 128-bit integers is now automatically detected and enabled.][8]
  Setting the `i128` crate feature now causes the build script to panic if such
  support is not detected.

# Release 0.1.37 (2018-05-10)

- [`Integer` is now implemented for `i128` and `u128`][7] starting with Rust
  1.26, enabled by the new `i128` crate feature.

**Contributors**: @cuviper

# Release 0.1.36 (2018-02-06)

- [num-integer now has its own source repository][num-356] at [rust-num/num-integer][home].
- [Corrected the argument order documented in `Integer::is_multiple_of`][1]
- [There is now a `std` feature][5], enabled by default, along with the implication
  that building *without* this feature makes this a `#[no_std]` crate.
  - There is no difference in the API at this time.
