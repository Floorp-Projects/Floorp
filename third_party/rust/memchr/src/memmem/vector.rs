/// A trait for describing vector operations used by vectorized searchers.
///
/// The trait is highly constrained to low level vector operations needed. In
/// general, it was invented mostly to be generic over x86's __m128i and
/// __m256i types. It's likely that once std::simd becomes a thing, we can
/// migrate to that since the operations required are quite simple.
///
/// TODO: Consider moving this trait up a level and using it to implement
/// memchr as well. The trait might need to grow one or two methods, but
/// otherwise should be close to sufficient already.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// All methods are not safe since they are intended to be implemented using
/// vendor intrinsics, which are also not safe. Callers must ensure that the
/// appropriate target features are enabled in the calling function, and that
/// the current CPU supports them. All implementations should avoid marking the
/// routines with #[target_feature] and instead mark them as #[inline(always)]
/// to ensure they get appropriately inlined. (inline(always) cannot be used
/// with target_feature.)
