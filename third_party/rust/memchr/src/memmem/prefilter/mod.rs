/// of a reverse search, the position returned corresponds to the position
/// immediately after a match (confirmed or possible). Its minimum value is `1`

/// In both cases, the position returned is the starting (or ending) point of a

/// positives are generated, then it's possible for search time to be worse
/// than if the prefilter wasn't enabled in the first place.
