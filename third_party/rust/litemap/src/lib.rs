//! # `litemap`
//!
//! `litemap` is a crate providing [`LiteMap`], a highly simplistic "flat" key-value map
//! based off of a single sorted vector.
//!
//! The goal of this crate is to provide a map that is good enough for small
//! sizes, and does not carry the binary size impact of [`HashMap`](std::collections::HashMap)
//! or [`BTreeMap`](alloc::collections::BTreeMap).
//!
//! If binary size is not a concern, [`std::collections::BTreeMap`] may be a better choice
//! for your use case. It behaves very similarly to [`LiteMap`] for less than 12 elements,
//! and upgrades itself gracefully for larger inputs.
//!
//! ## Pluggable Backends
//!
//! By default, [`LiteMap`] is backed by a [`Vec`]; however, it can be backed by any appropriate
//! random-access data store, giving that data store a map-like interface. See the [`store`]
//! module for more details.
//!
//! [`Vec`]: alloc::vec::Vec
