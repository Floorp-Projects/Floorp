## `litemap`

`litemap` is a crate providing [`LiteMap`], a highly simplistic "flat" key-value map
based off of a single sorted vector.

The goal of this crate is to provide a map that is good enough for small
sizes, and does not carry the binary size impact of [`HashMap`](std::collections::HashMap)
or [`BTreeMap`](alloc::collections::BTreeMap).

If binary size is not a concern, [`std::collections::BTreeMap`] may be a better choice
for your use case. It behaves very similarly to [`LiteMap`] for less than 12 elements,
and upgrades itself gracefully for larger inputs.

### Pluggable Backends

By default, [`LiteMap`] is backed by a [`Vec`]; however, it can be backed by any appropriate
random-access data store, giving that data store a map-like interface. See the [`store`]
module for more details.

[`Vec`]: alloc::vec::Vec
