//! Callback interfaces are traits specified in UDL which can be implemented by foreign languages.
//!
//! # Using callback interfaces
//!
//! 1. Define a Rust trait.
//!
//! This toy example defines a way of Rust accessing a key-value store exposed
//! by the host operating system (e.g. the key chain).
//!
//! ```
//! trait Keychain: Send {
//!   fn get(&self, key: String) -> Option<String>;
//!   fn put(&self, key: String, value: String);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! 2. Define a callback interface in the UDL
//!
//! ```idl
//! callback interface Keychain {
//!     string? get(string key);
//!     void put(string key, string data);
//! };
//! ```
//!
//! 3. And allow it to be passed into Rust.
//!
//! Here, we define a constructor to pass the keychain to rust, and then another method
//! which may use it.
//!
//! In UDL:
//! ```idl
//! object Authenticator {
//!     constructor(Keychain keychain);
//!     void login();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! In Rust:
//!
//! ```
//!# trait Keychain: Send {
//!#  fn get(&self, key: String) -> Option<String>;
//!#  fn put(&self, key: String, value: String);
//!# }
//! struct Authenticator {
//!   keychain: Box<dyn Keychain>,
//! }
//!
//! impl Authenticator {
//!   pub fn new(keychain: Box<dyn Keychain>) -> Self {
//!     Self { keychain }
//!   }
//!   pub fn login(&self) {
//!     let username = self.keychain.get("username".into());
//!     let password = self.keychain.get("password".into());
//!   }
//! }
//! ```
//! 4. Create an foreign language implementation of the callback interface.
//!
//! In this example, here's a Kotlin implementation.
//!
//! ```kotlin
//! class AndroidKeychain: Keychain {
//!     override fun get(key: String): String? {
//!         // … elide the implementation.
//!         return value
//!     }
//!     override fun put(key: String) {
//!         // … elide the implementation.
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//! 5. Pass the implementation to Rust.
//!
//! Again, in Kotlin
//!
//! ```kotlin
//! val authenticator = Authenticator(AndroidKeychain())
//! authenticator.login()
//! ```
//!
//! # How it works.
//!
//! ## High level
//!
//! Uniffi generates a protocol or interface in client code in the foreign language must implement.
//!
//! For each callback interface, a `CallbackInternals` (on the Foreign Language side) and `ForeignCallbackInternals`
//! (on Rust side) manages the process through a `ForeignCallback`. There is one `ForeignCallback` per callback interface.
//!
//! Passing a callback interface implementation from foreign language (e.g. `AndroidKeychain`) into Rust causes the
//! `KeychainCallbackInternals` to store the instance in a handlemap.
//!
//! The object handle is passed over to Rust, and used to instantiate a struct `KeychainProxy` which implements
//! the trait. This proxy implementation is generate by Uniffi. The `KeychainProxy` object is then passed to
//! client code as `Box<dyn Keychain>`.
//!
//! Methods on `KeychainProxy` objects (e.g. `self.keychain.get("username".into())`) encode the arguments into a `RustBuffer`.
//! Using the `ForeignCallback`, it calls the `CallbackInternals` object on the foreign language side using the
//! object handle, and the method selector.
//!
//! The `CallbackInternals` object unpacks the arguments from the passed buffer, gets the object out from the handlemap,
//! and calls the actual implementation of the method.
//!
//! If there's a return value, it is packed up in to another `RustBuffer` and used as the return value for
//! `ForeignCallback`. The caller of `ForeignCallback`, the `KeychainProxy` unpacks the returned buffer into the correct
//! type and then returns to client code.
//!

/// ForeignCallback is the Rust representation of a foreign language function.
/// It is the basis for all callbacks interfaces. It is registered exactly once per callback interface,
/// at library start up time.
/// Calling this method is only done by generated objects which mirror callback interfaces objects in the foreign language.
///
/// * The `handle` is the key into a handle map on the other side of the FFI used to look up the foreign language object
///   that implements the callback interface/trait.
/// * The `method` selector specifies the method that will be called on the object, by looking it up in a list of methods from
///   the IDL. The index is 1 indexed. Note that the list of methods is generated by at uniffi from the IDL and used in all
///   bindings: so we can rely on the method list being stable within the same run of uniffi.
/// * `args` is a serialized buffer of arguments to the function. UniFFI will deserialize it before
///   passing individual arguments to the user's callback.
/// * `buf_ptr` is a pointer to where the resulting buffer will be written. UniFFI will allocate a
///   buffer to write the result into.
/// * A callback returns `-1` if an unexpected error happens, `0` if the call succeeded without a
///   return value or `1` if data was written into the output buffer.
///   Note: The output buffer might still contain 0 bytes of data.
