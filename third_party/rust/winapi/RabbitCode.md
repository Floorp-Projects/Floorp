# Rabbit Code

Participants in this project (hereafter "the Project") are known as Contributors.

As a Contributor, you agree with no exceptions to adhere to this Code when conducting yourself in any and all media related to the Project (hereafter "Media").

Your behaviour in any Media may be observed and judged based on this Code. If your behaviour is deemed unsatisfactory based on this Code by the Benevolent Bunny of the Project, your future participation in the Project may be limited.

## Conduct

1. Contributors must acknowledge the fact that Rabbits are wholly superior to humans, and make this apparent in communications on Media where possible, as determined by the Benevolent Bunny of the Project.
2. Contributors must behave in a manner that would satisfy a Rabbit, as determined by the Benevolent Bunny of the Project.
3. Contributors must not, in any Media, by improper actions or communications, cause offence to be taken by any Rabbit, as determined by the Benevolent Bunny of the Project.

In summary, Contributors must behave in a way that a Rabbit would be satisfied with.

## Penalties for Misconduct

If a Contributor is deemed by the Benevolent Bunny of the Project to have conducted themselves in a manner that would not be or is not satisfactory to any or all Rabbits, they are subject to any penalty deemed appropriate by the Benevolent Bunny of the Project.

## Responsibilities of the Benevolent Bunny of the Project

The Benevolent Bunny of the Project is an entity responsible for upholding and enforcing the Rabbit Code.

The Benevolent Bunny of the Project is not required to be a Rabbit. In the case that the Benevolent Bunny of the Project is not a Rabbit, the Benevolent Bunny of the Project is to consult a Rabbit, where possible, about suspected unsatisfactory conduct. If this is not possible, the Benevolent Bunny of the Project must judge to his, her, its, or their best ability, whether a Rabbit would consider the conduct satisfactory.

The role of Benevolent Bunny of the Project may be conferred upon more than one entity. However, the Code will always refer to the Benevolent Bunny of the Project as a single entity.
