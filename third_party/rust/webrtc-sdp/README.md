A SDP parser written in Rust specifically aimed to handle WebRTC SDP offers and answers.

## Dependecies

* Rust >= 1.45.0
* log module
* serde module
* serde-derive module

Cargo installs the missing modules automatically when building webrtc-sdp for the first time.

## The webrtc-sdp API

The main function is:
```rust
fn parse_sdp(sdp: &str, fail_on_warning: bool) -> Result<SdpSession, SdpParserError>
```
The `sdp` parameter is the string which will get parsed. The `fail_on_warning` parameter determines how to treat warnings encountered during parsing. Any problems encountered during are stored until the whole string has been parsed. Any problem during parsing falls into two catgeories:

* Fatal error preventing further parsing or processing of the SDP
* Warning which don't block further processing of the SDP

Warnings will be for example unknown parameters in attributes. Setting `fail_on_warning` to `true` makes most sense during development, when you want to be aware of all potential problems. In production `fail_on_warning` is expected to be `false`.

`parse_sdp()` returns either an `SdpSession` struct ([code](https://github.com/mozilla/webrtc-sdp/blob/master/src/lib.rs#L137)) which contains all the parsed information. Or in case a fatal error was encountered (or if `fail_on_warning` was set to `true` and any warnings were encountered) an `SdpParserError` ([code](https://github.com/mozilla/webrtc-sdp/blob/master/src/error.rs#L117)) will be returned as a `Result`.

## Examples

The [file parser](https://github.com/mozilla/webrtc-sdp/blob/master/examples/file_parser.rs) in the webrtc-sdp package gives you an easy example of how to invoke the webrtc-sdp parser.

## Contributing

As the Travis CI runs are checking for code formating and clippy warnings please run the following commands locally, before submitting a Pull Request.

If you haven't clippy and Rust format installed already you add them like this:
```
rustup component add rustfmt-preview
rustup component add clippy
```

Check with clippy for warnings in the code:
```
cargo clippy
```

And format all of the code according to Rust code style convention:
```
cargo fmt --all
```

## Fuzzing

Install cargo-fuzz like this:
```
cargo install cargo-fuzz
```

With rust nightly you can start fuzzing like this:
```
cargo fuzz run fuzz_target_parse_sdp
```
