/// physical  and  swap)  on  the  system  as well as the shared memory and
/// buffers used by the kernel.  Each struct member is generally reported in
/// bytes, but a few are unitless values.
///

///
/// While the file shows kilobytes (kB; 1 kB equals 1000 B),
/// it is actually kibibytes (KiB; 1 KiB equals 1024 B).
///
/// All sizes are converted to bytes. Unitless values, like `hugepages_total` are not affected.
///
/// This imprecision in /proc/meminfo is known,
/// but is not corrected due to legacy concerns -
/// programs rely on /proc/meminfo to specify size with the "kB" string.
///
/// New fields to this struct may be added at any time (even without a major or minor semver bump).
