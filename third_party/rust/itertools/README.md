## How to contribute

- Fix a bug or implement a new thing
- Include tests for your new feature, preferably a QuickCheck test
- Make a Pull Request

For new features, please first consider filing a PR to [rust-lang/rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust),
adding your new feature to the `Iterator` trait of the standard library, if you believe it is reasonable.
If it isn't accepted there, proposing it for inclusion in ``itertools`` is a good idea.
The reason for doing is this is so that we avoid future breakage as with ``.flatten()``.
However, if your feature involves heap allocation, such as storing elements in a ``Vec<T>``,
then it can't be accepted into ``libcore``, and you should propose it for ``itertools`` directly instead.
