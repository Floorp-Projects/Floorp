# E721 do not compare types, use 'isinstance()'
#     We run afoul of the heuristics that detect this on lines of code
#     like `if method.return_type == types.UnitType:`. We are not comparing
#     Python types. The warning is spurious for us.
# W503 line break before binary operator
#     Amazingly, flake8 by default warns about binary operators no matter
#     what you do. We choose to break before operators.
