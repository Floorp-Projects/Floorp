# OsStr Bytes

This crate allows interacting with the data stored by [`OsStr`] and
[`OsString`], without resorting to panics or corruption for invalid UTF-8.
Thus, methods can be used that are already defined on [`[u8]`][slice] and
[`Vec<u8>`].

Typically, the only way to losslessly construct [`OsStr`] or [`OsString`] from
a byte sequence is to use `OsStr::new(str::from_utf8(bytes)?)`, which requires
the bytes to be valid in UTF-8. However, since this crate makes conversions
directly between the platform encoding and raw bytes, even some strings invalid
in UTF-8 can be converted.

## Usage

Add the following lines to your "Cargo.toml" file:

```toml
[dependencies]
os_str_bytes = "6.0"
```

See the [documentation] for available functionality and examples.

## Rust version support

The minimum supported Rust toolchain version depends on the platform:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Target</th>
        <th>Target Triple</th>
        <th>Minimum Version</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Fortanix</td>
        <td><code>*-fortanix-*-sgx</code></td>
        <td>nightly (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/unstable-book/library-features/sgx-platform.html"><code>sgx_platform</code></a>)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Unix</td>
        <td>Unix</td>
        <td>1.52.0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>WASI</td>
        <td><code>*-wasi</code></td>
        <td>1.52.0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>WebAssembly</td>
        <td><code>wasm32-*-unknown</code></td>
        <td>1.52.0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Windows</td>
        <td><code>*-windows-*</code></td>
        <td>1.52.0</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Minor version updates may increase these version requirements. However, the
previous two Rust releases will always be supported. If the minimum Rust
version must not be increased, use a tilde requirement to prevent updating this
crate's minor version:

```toml
[dependencies]
os_str_bytes = "~6.0"
```
