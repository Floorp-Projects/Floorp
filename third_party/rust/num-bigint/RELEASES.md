# Release 0.2.6 (2020-01-27)

- [Fix the promotion of negative `isize` in `BigInt` assign-ops][133].

**Contributors**: @cuviper, @HactarCE

[133]: https://github.com/rust-num/num-bigint/pull/133

# Release 0.2.5 (2020-01-09)

- [Updated the `autocfg` build dependency to 1.0][126].

**Contributors**: @cuviper, @tspiteri

[126]: https://github.com/rust-num/num-bigint/pull/126

# Release 0.2.4 (2020-01-01)

- [The new `BigUint::to_u32_digits` method][104] returns the number as a
  little-endian vector of base-2<sup>32</sup> digits. The same method on
  `BigInt` also returns the sign.
- [`BigUint::modpow` now applies a modulus even for exponent 1][113], which
  also affects `BigInt::modpow`.
- [`BigInt::modpow` now returns the correct sign for negative bases with even
  exponents][114].

# Release 0.2.3 (2019-09-03)

- [`Pow` is now implemented for `BigUint` exponents][77].
- [The optional `quickcheck` feature enables implementations of `Arbitrary`][99].
- See the [full comparison][compare-0.2.3] for performance enhancements and more!

# Release 0.2.2 (2018-12-14)

- [The `Roots` implementations now use better initial guesses][71].
- [Fixed `to_signed_bytes_*` for some positive numbers][72], where the
  most-significant byte is `0x80` and the rest are `0`.

# Release 0.2.1 (2018-11-02)

- [`RandBigInt` now uses `Rng::fill_bytes`][53] to improve performance, instead
  of repeated `gen::<u32>` calls.  The also affects the implementations of the
  other `rand` traits.  This may potentially change the values produced by some
  seeded RNGs on previous versions, but the values were tested to be stable
  with `ChaChaRng`, `IsaacRng`, and `XorShiftRng`.
- [`BigInt` and `BigUint` now implement `num_integer::Roots`][56].
- [`BigInt` and `BigUint` now implement `num_traits::Pow`][54].
- [`BigInt` and `BigUint` now implement operators with 128-bit integers][64].

# Release 0.2.0 (2018-05-25)

### Enhancements

- [`BigInt` and `BigUint` now implement `Product` and `Sum`][22] for iterators
  of any item that we can `Mul` and `Add`, respectively.  For example, a
  factorial can now be simply: `let f: BigUint = (1u32..1000).product();`
- [`BigInt` now supports two's-complement logic operations][26], namely
  `BitAnd`, `BitOr`, `BitXor`, and `Not`.  These act conceptually as if each
  number had an infinite prefix of `0` or `1` bits for positive or negative.
- [`BigInt` now supports assignment operators][41] like `AddAssign`.
- [`BigInt` and `BigUint` now support conversions with `i128` and `u128`][44],
  if sufficient compiler support is detected.
- [`BigInt` and `BigUint` now implement rand's `SampleUniform` trait][48], and
  [a custom `RandomBits` distribution samples by bit size][49].
- The release also includes other miscellaneous improvements to performance.

### Breaking Changes

- [`num-bigint` now requires rustc 1.15 or greater][23].
- [The crate now has a `std` feature, and won't build without it][46].  This is
  in preparation for someday supporting `#![no_std]` with `alloc`.
- [The `serde` dependency has been updated to 1.0][24], still disabled by
  default.  The `rustc-serialize` crate is no longer supported by `num-bigint`.
- [The `rand` dependency has been updated to 0.5][48], now disabled by default.
  This requires rustc 1.22 or greater for `rand`'s own requirement.
- [`Shr for BigInt` now rounds down][8] rather than toward zero, matching the
  behavior of the primitive integers for negative values.
- [`ParseBigIntError` is now an opaque type][37].
- [The `big_digit` module is no longer public][38], nor are the `BigDigit` and
  `DoubleBigDigit` types and `ZERO_BIG_DIGIT` constant that were re-exported in
  the crate root.  Public APIs which deal in digits, like `BigUint::from_slice`,
  will now always be base-`u32`.

# Release 0.1.43 (2018-02-08)

- [`lcm` now avoids creating a large intermediate product][num-350].
- [`gcd` now uses Stein's algorithm][15] with faster shifts instead of division.
- [`rand` support is now extended to 0.4][11] (while still allowing 0.3).
