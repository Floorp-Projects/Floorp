/*! Universal shader translator.

The central structure of the crate is [`Module`]. A `Module` contains:

- [`Function`]s, which have arguments, a return type, local variables, and a body,

- [`EntryPoint`]s, which are specialized functions that can serve as the entry
  point for pipeline stages like vertex shading or fragment shading,

- [`Constant`]s and [`GlobalVariable`]s used by `EntryPoint`s and `Function`s, and

- [`Type`]s used by the above.

The body of an `EntryPoint` or `Function` is represented using two types:

- An [`Expression`] produces a value, but has no side effects or control flow.
  `Expressions` include variable references, unary and binary operators, and so
  on.

- A [`Statement`] can have side effects and structured control flow.
  `Statement`s do not produce a value, other than by storing one in some
  designated place. `Statements` include blocks, conditionals, and loops, but also
  operations that have side effects, like stores and function calls.

`Statement`s form a tree, with pointers into the DAG of `Expression`s.

Restricting side effects to statements simplifies analysis and code generation.
A Naga backend can generate code to evaluate an `Expression` however and
whenever it pleases, as long as it is certain to observe the side effects of all
previously executed `Statement`s.

Many `Statement` variants use the [`Block`] type, which is `Vec<Statement>`,
with optional span info, representing a series of statements executed in order. The body of an
`EntryPoint`s or `Function` is a `Block`, and `Statement` has a
[`Block`][Statement::Block] variant.

## Arenas

To improve translator performance and reduce memory usage, most structures are
stored in an [`Arena`]. An `Arena<T>` stores a series of `T` values, indexed by
[`Handle<T>`](Handle) values, which are just wrappers around integer indexes.
For example, a `Function`'s expressions are stored in an `Arena<Expression>`,
and compound expressions refer to their sub-expressions via `Handle<Expression>`
values. (When examining the serialized form of a `Module`, note that the first
element of an `Arena` has an index of 1, not 0.)

A [`UniqueArena`] is just like an `Arena`, except that it stores only a single
instance of each value. The value type must implement `Eq` and `Hash`. Like an
`Arena`, inserting a value into a `UniqueArena` returns a `Handle` which can be
used to efficiently access the value, without a hash lookup. Inserting a value
multiple times returns the same `Handle`.

If the `span` feature is enabled, both `Arena` and `UniqueArena` can associate a
source code span with each element.

## Function Calls

Naga's representation of function calls is unusual. Most languages treat
function calls as expressions, but because calls may have side effects, Naga
represents them as a kind of statement, [`Statement::Call`]. If the function
returns a value, a call statement designates a particular [`Expression::CallResult`]
expression to represent its return value, for use by subsequent statements and
expressions.

## `Expression` evaluation time

It is essential to know when an [`Expression`] should be evaluated, because its
value may depend on previous [`Statement`]s' effects. But whereas the order of
execution for a tree of `Statement`s is apparent from its structure, it is not
so clear for `Expressions`, since an expression may be referred to by any number
of `Statement`s and other `Expression`s.

Naga's rules for when `Expression`s are evaluated are as follows:

-   [`Constant`](Expression::Constant) expressions are considered to be
    implicitly evaluated before execution begins.

-   [`FunctionArgument`] and [`LocalVariable`] expressions are considered
    implicitly evaluated upon entry to the function to which they belong.
    Function arguments cannot be assigned to, and `LocalVariable` expressions
    produce a *pointer to* the variable's value (for use with [`Load`] and
    [`Store`]). Neither varies while the function executes, so it suffices to
    consider these expressions evaluated once on entry.

-   Similarly, [`GlobalVariable`] expressions are considered implicitly
    evaluated before execution begins, since their value does not change while
    code executes, for one of two reasons:

    -   Most `GlobalVariable` expressions produce a pointer to the variable's
        value, for use with [`Load`] and [`Store`], as `LocalVariable`
        expressions do. Although the variable's value may change, its address
        does not.

    -   A `GlobalVariable` expression referring to a global in the
        [`StorageClass::Handle`] storage class produces the value directly, not
        a pointer. Such global variables hold opaque types like shaders or
        images, and cannot be assigned to.

-   A [`CallResult`] expression that is the `result` of a [`Statement::Call`],
    representing the call's return value, is evaluated when the `Call` statement
    is executed.

-   Similarly, an [`AtomicResult`] expression that is the `result` of an
    [`Atomic`] statement, representing the result of the atomic operation, is
    evaluated when the `Atomic` statement is executed.

-   All other expressions are evaluated when the (unique) [`Statement::Emit`]
    statement that covers them is executed. The [`Expression::needs_pre_emit`]
    method returns `true` if the given expression is one of those variants that
    does *not* need to be covered by an `Emit` statement.

Now, strictly speaking, not all `Expression` variants actually care when they're
evaluated. For example, you can evaluate a [`BinaryOperator::Add`] expression
any time you like, as long as you give it the right operands. It's really only a
very small set of expressions that are affected by timing:

-   [`Load`], [`ImageSample`], and [`ImageLoad`] expressions are influenced by
    stores to the variables or images they access, and must execute at the
    proper time relative to them.

-   [`Derivative`] expressions are sensitive to control flow uniformity: they
    must not be moved out of an area of uniform control flow into a non-uniform
    area.

-   More generally, any expression that's used by more than one other expression
    or statement should probably be evaluated only once, and then stored in a
    variable to be cited at each point of use.

Naga tries to help back ends handle all these cases correctly in a somewhat
circuitous way. The [`ModuleInfo`] structure returned by [`Validator::validate`]
provides a reference count for each expression in each function in the module.
Naturally, any expression with a reference count of two or more deserves to be
evaluated and stored in a temporary variable at the point that the `Emit`
statement covering it is executed. But if we selectively lower the reference
count threshold to _one_ for the sensitive expression types listed above, so
that we _always_ generate a temporary variable and save their value, then the
same code that manages multiply referenced expressions will take care of
introducing temporaries for time-sensitive expressions as well. The
`Expression::bake_ref_count` method (private to the back ends) is meant to help
with this.

## `Expression` scope

Each `Expression` has a *scope*, which is the region of the function within
which it can be used by `Statement`s and other `Expression`s. It is a validation
error to use an `Expression` outside its scope.

An expression's scope is defined as follows:

-   The scope of a [`Constant`], [`GlobalVariable`], [`FunctionArgument`] or
    [`LocalVariable`] expression covers the entire `Function` in which it
    occurs.

-   The scope of an expression evaluated by an [`Emit`] statement covers the
    subsequent expressions in that `Emit`, the subsequent statements in the `Block`
    to which that `Emit` belongs (if any) and their sub-statements (if any).

-   The `result` expression of a [`Call`] or [`Atomic`] statement has a scope
    covering the subsequent statements in the `Block` in which the statement
    occurs (if any) and their sub-statements (if any).

For example, this implies that an expression evaluated by some statement in a
nested `Block` is not available in the `Block`'s parents. Such a value would
need to be stored in a local variable to be carried upwards in the statement
tree.

/// An [`EntryPoint`] is a [`Function`] that serves as the main function for a
/// graphics or compute pipeline stage. For example, an `EntryPoint` whose
/// [`stage`] is [`ShaderStage::Vertex`] can serve as a graphics pipeline's
/// vertex shader.
///
/// Since an entry point is called directly by the graphics or compute pipeline,
/// not by other WGSL functions, you must specify what the pipeline should pass
/// as the entry point's arguments, and what values it will return. For example,
/// a vertex shader needs a vertex's attributes as its arguments, but if it's
/// used for instanced draw calls, it will also want to know the instance id.
/// The vertex shader's return value will usually include an output vertex
/// position, and possibly other attributes to be interpolated and passed along
/// to a fragment shader.
///
/// To specify this, the arguments and result of an `EntryPoint`'s [`function`]
/// must each have a [`Binding`], or be structs whose members all have
/// `Binding`s. This associates every value passed to or returned from the entry
/// point with either a [`BuiltIn`] or a [`Location`]:
///
/// -   A [`BuiltIn`] has special semantics, usually specific to its pipeline
///     stage. For example, the result of a vertex shader can include a
///     [`BuiltIn::Position`] value, which determines the position of a vertex
///     of a rendered primitive. Or, a compute shader might take an argument
///     whose binding is [`BuiltIn::WorkGroupSize`], through which the compute
///     pipeline would pass the number of invocations in your workgroup.
///
/// -   A [`Location`] indicates user-defined IO to be passed from one pipeline
///     stage to the next. For example, a vertex shader might also produce a
///     `uv` texture location as a user-defined IO value.
///
/// In other words, the pipeline stage's input and output interface are
/// determined by the bindings of the arguments and result of the `EntryPoint`'s
/// [`function`].
