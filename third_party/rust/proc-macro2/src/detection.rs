// Swap in a null panic hook to avoid printing "thread panicked" to stderr,
// then use catch_unwind to determine whether the compiler's proc_macro is
// working. When proc-macro2 is used from outside of a procedural macro all
// of the proc_macro crate's APIs currently panic.
//
// The Once is to prevent the possibility of this ordering:
//
//     thread 1 calls take_hook, gets the user's original hook
//     thread 1 calls set_hook with the null hook
//     thread 2 calls take_hook, thinks null hook is the original hook
//     thread 2 calls set_hook with the null hook
//     thread 1 calls set_hook with the actual original hook
//     thread 2 calls set_hook with what it thinks is the original hook
//
// in which the user's hook has been lost.
//
// There is still a race condition where a panic in a different thread can
// happen during the interval that the user's original panic hook is
// unregistered such that their hook is incorrectly not called. This is
// sufficiently unlikely and less bad than printing panic messages to stderr
// on correct use of this crate. Maybe there is a libstd feature request
// here. For now, if a user needs to guarantee that this failure mode does
// not occur, they need to call e.g. `proc_macro2::Span::call_site()` from
// the main thread before launching any other threads.
