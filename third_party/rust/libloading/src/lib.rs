//! Bindings around the platform's dynamic library loading primitives with greatly improved memory safety.
//!
//! Using this library allows the loading of [dynamic libraries](struct.Library.html), also known as
//! shared libraries, and the use of the functions and static variables they contain.
//!
//! The `libloading` crate exposes a cross-platform interface to load a library and make use of its
//! contents, but little is done to hide the differences in behaviour between platforms.
//! The API documentation strives to document such differences as much as possible.
//!
//! Platform-specific APIs are also available in the [`os`](crate::os) module. These APIs are more
//! flexible, but less safe.
//!
//! # Installation
//!
//! Add the `libloading` library to your dependencies in `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! libloading = "0.7"
//! ```
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! In your code, run the following:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! fn call_dynamic() -> Result<u32, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!     unsafe {
//!         let lib = libloading::Library::new("/path/to/liblibrary.so")?;
//!         let func: libloading::Symbol<unsafe extern fn() -> u32> = lib.get(b"my_func")?;
//!         Ok(func())
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The compiler will ensure that the loaded function will not outlive the `Library` from which it comes,
//! preventing the most common memory-safety issues.
