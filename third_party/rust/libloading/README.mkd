# libloading

Bindings around the platform's dynamic library loading primitives with greatly improved memory safety. The most important safety guarantee of this library is the prevention of dangling `Symbol`s that may occur after a `Library` is unloaded.

Using this library allows the loading of dynamic libraries, also known as shared libraries, as well as the use of the functions and static variables that these libraries may contain.
