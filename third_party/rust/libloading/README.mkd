A memory-safer wrapper around system dynamic library loading primitives. The most important safety
guarantee by this library is prevention of dangling-`Symbol`s that may occur after a `Library` is
unloaded.

Using this library allows loading dynamic libraries (also known as shared libraries) as well as use
functions and static variables these libraries contain.

Note, that this library is not a drop-in replacement for the deprecated `dynamic_lib`. Many
dubious APIs (notably, library search path modification) were prunned and string arguments
take types that match conventions and system APIs better.
