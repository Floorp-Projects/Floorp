This directory contains the msgpack source from the upstream repo:

https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-c

Current version: cpp-3.1.0 [commit b6803a5fecbe321458faafd6a079dac466614ff9]

UPDATING:

Our in-tree copy of msgpack does not depend on any generated files from the
upstream build system. Therefore, it should be sufficient to simply overwrite
the in-tree files one the updated ones from upstream to perform updates.

To simplify this, the in-tree copy can be updated by running

  sh update.sh

from within the third_party/msgpack directory.

If the collection of source files changes, manual updates to moz.build may be
needed as we don't use the upstream makefiles.
