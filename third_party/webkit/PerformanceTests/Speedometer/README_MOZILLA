The source from this directory was copied from the
PerformanceTests/Speedometer directory of the Webkit repository

The contents of this directory are intended for use to "train" the
profile guided optimization (PGO) of Firefox and for benchmarking
scenarios. The files inside this directory are not intended to ship
with Firefox or any other product. If files inside this directory
are useful for other purposes (e.g. JavaScript libraries), consumers
should vendor those files separately, as it is not appropriate to pull
in components of Speedometer for use outside of Speedometer.
