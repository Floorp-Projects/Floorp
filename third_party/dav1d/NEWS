Changes for 0.3.0 'Sailfish':
------------------------------

This is the final release for the numerous speed improvements of 0.3.0-rc.
It mostly:
 - Fixes an annoying crash on SSSE3 that happened in the itx functions


Changes for 0.2.2 (0.3.0-rc) 'Antelope':
-----------------------------

 - Large improvement on MSAC decoding with SSE, bringing 4-6% speed increase
   The impact is important on SSSE3, SSE4 and AVX-2 cpus
 - SSSE3 optimizations for all blocks size in itx
 - SSSE3 optimizations for ipred_paeth and ipref_cfl (420, 422 and 444)
 - Speed improvements on CDEF for SSE4 CPUs
 - NEON optimizations for SGR and loop filter
 - Minor crashes, improvements and build changes


Changes for 0.2.1 'Antelope':
----------------------------

 - SSSE3 optimization for cdef_dir
 - AVX-2 improvements of the existing CDEF optimizations
 - NEON improvements of the existing CDEF and wiener optimizations
 - Clarification about the numbering/versionning scheme


Changes for 0.2.0 'Antelope':
----------------------------

 - ARM64 and ARM optimizations using NEON instructions
 - SSSE3 optimizations for both 32 and 64bits
 - More AVX-2 assembly, reaching almost completion
 - Fix installation of includes
 - Rewrite inverse transforms to avoid overflows
 - Snap packaging for Linux
 - Updated API (ABI and API break)
 - Fixes for un-decodable samples


Changes for 0.1.0 'Gazelle':
----------------------------

Initial release of dav1d, the fast and small AV1 decoder.
 - Support for all features of the AV1 bitstream
 - Support for all bitdepth, 8, 10 and 12bits
 - Support for all chroma subsamplings 4:2:0, 4:2:2, 4:4:4 *and* grayscale
 - Full acceleration for AVX-2 64bits processors, making it the fastest decoder
 - Partial acceleration for SSSE3 processors
 - Partial acceleration for NEON processors
