// delay because it allows decode order to differ from render order.
// The mechanism used is to rewrite (edit or add) the SPS's VUI to contain
// restrictions on the maximum number of reordered pictures. This reduces

// decoding.

  // no rewrite was necessary, but the end offset should remain unchanged.
  // Unless parsing fails, the sps parameter will be populated with the parsed
