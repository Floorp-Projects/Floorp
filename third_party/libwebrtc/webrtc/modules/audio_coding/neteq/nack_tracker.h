//
// The NackTracker class keeps track of the lost packets, an estimate of
// time-to-play for each packet is also given.
//
// Every time a packet is pushed into NetEq, LastReceivedPacket() has to be
// called to update the NACK list.
//
// Every time 10ms audio is pulled from NetEq LastDecodedPacket() should be
// called, and time-to-play is updated at that moment.
//
// If packet N is received, any packet prior to |N - NackThreshold| which is not
// arrived is considered lost, and should be labeled as "missing" (the size of
// the list might be limited and older packet eliminated from the list). Packets
// |N - NackThreshold|, |N - NackThreshold + 1|, ..., |N - 1| are considered
// "late." A "late" packet with sequence number K is changed to "missing" any
// time a packet with sequence number newer than |K + NackList| is arrived.
//
// The NackTracker class has to know about the sample rate of the packets to
// compute time-to-play. So sample rate should be set as soon as the first
// packet is received. If there is a change in the receive codec (sender changes
// codec) then NackTracker should be reset. This is because NetEQ would flush
// its buffer and re-transmission is meaning less for old packet. Therefore, in
// that case, after reset the sampling rate has to be updated.
//
// Thread Safety
// =============
// Please note that this class in not thread safe. The class must be protected
// if different APIs are called from different threads.
