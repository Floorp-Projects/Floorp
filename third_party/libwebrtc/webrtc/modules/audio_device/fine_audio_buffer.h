// FineAudioBuffer takes an AudioDeviceBuffer (ADB) which deals with audio data
// corresponding to 10ms of data. It then allows for this data to be pulled in
// a finer or coarser granularity. I.e. interacting with this class instead of
// directly with the AudioDeviceBuffer one can ask for any number of audio data
// samples. This class also ensures that audio data can be delivered to the ADB
// in 10ms chunks when the size of the provided audio buffers differs from 10ms.
// As an example: calling DeliverRecordedData() with 5ms buffers will deliver
// accumulated 10ms worth of data to the ADB every second call.
// TODO(henrika): add support for stereo when mobile platforms need it.

  // |device_buffer| is a buffer that provides 10ms of audio data.
  // |sample_rate| is the sample rate of the audio data. This is needed because
  // |device_buffer| delivers 10ms of data. Given the sample rate the number
  // of samples can be calculated. The |capacity| ensures that the buffer size
  // can be increased to at least capacity without further reallocation.
