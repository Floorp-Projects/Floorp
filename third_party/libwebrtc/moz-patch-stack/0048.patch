Subject: Bug 1654112 - Don't check the calling thread in
 webrtc::AudioReceiveStream::GetSources. r=ng

source_tracker_ is thread safe with its own internal mutex, so this call is safe
as long as the caller has a guarantee for the lifetime of the
AudioReceiveStream. This is similar to webrtc::VideoReceiveStream.

Upliftable.
