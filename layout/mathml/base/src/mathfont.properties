# List of fonts that have corresponding properties files containing special
# glyph tables for stretching MathML characters.  See the documentation at the
# end of this file for details on the setup of the property file associated to
# each font.  Do not include the Unicode table in this list.

font.mathfont-glyph-tables = STIXNonUnicode, STIXSize1, Standard Symbols L

# The ordered list of fonts with which to attempt to stretch MathML
# characters is controlled by setting pref("font.mathfont-family",
# "CMSY10, CMEX10, ...") for example, or by setting the font-family list in
# :-moz-math-stretchy in mathml.css.
#
# Preferred fonts for particular stretchy characters may be specified in
# preferences.  Each entry is specified using the Unicode format of the
# character, and the comma-separated list of fonts like in the font-family
# property of CSS.  A character can request different fonts for its variants
# and for its parts.
# e.g. pref("font.mathfont-family.\\u2264.base", "CMSY10, etc")
# - A ".base" extension indicates the ordered list fonts to look for the glyph
#   at its base size.
# - The ".variants" extension indicates the ordered list of fonts where to
#   look for glyphs of larger sizes.
# - The ".parts" extension indicates the ordered list of fonts that should be
#   used to look for the partial glyphs to be used to build up the character.
#
# Note: setting base fonts for non-stretchy characters only works
# for operators that are ultimately handled by nsMathMLChar.
# @see how |useMathMLChar| is set in nsMathMLmoFrame::Stretch() & Paint().

# DOCUMENTATION ON HOW TO SETUP THE PROPERTY FILE ASSOCIATED TO EACH FONT
# More fonts can be supported for stretchy characters by setting up mathfont
# property files as described below.
#
# Each font should have its set of glyph data. For example, the glyph data for
# the "Symbol" font and the "MT Extra" font are in "mathfontSymbol.properties"
# and "mathfontMTExtra.properties", respectively. The font property file is a
# set of all the stretchy MathML characters that can be rendered with that font
# using larger and/or partial glyphs. Each stretchy character is associated to
# a list in the font property file which gives, in that order, the 4 partial
# glyphs: top (or left), middle, bottom (or right), glue; and the variants of
# bigger sizes (if any). A position that is not relevant to a particular character
# is indicated there with the UNICODE REPLACEMENT CHARACTER 0xFFFD.
#
# Characters that need to be built from other characters are said to be composite.
# For example, characters like over/underbrace in CMEX10 have to be built from two
# half stretchy chars and joined in the middle (TeXbook, p.225). Several (i.e., 2
# or more) child characters can be composed in order to render another chararacter.
# To specify such characters, their list of glyphs in the property file should be
# given as space-separated segments of glyphs. Each segment gives the 4 partial glyphs
# with which to build the child character that will be joined with its other siblings.
