   *
   * 1. Use InheritAutomaticData() to set properties related to your ancestors:

   *    - set properties that depend on the state that you expect your ancestors

   *    - set properties that your descendants assume that you would have set in
   *      your InheritAutomaticData() -- this way, they can safely query them
   *      and the process will feed upon itself.
   *
   * 2. Use TransmitAutomaticData() to set properties related to your
   *    descendants:
   *    - set properties that depend on the state that you expect your
   *      descendants to have reached upon processing their own
   *      TransmitAutomaticData().
   *    - transmit properties that your descendants expect that you will
   *      transmit to them in your TransmitAutomaticData() -- this way, they
   *      remain up-to-date.
   *    - set properties that your ancestors expect that you would set in your
