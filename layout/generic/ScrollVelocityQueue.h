/**
 * ScrollVelocityQueue is used to determine the current velocity of a
 * scroll frame, derived from scroll position samples.
 *
 * Using the last iteration's scroll position, stored in mLastPosition, a
 * delta of the scroll position is calculated and accumulated in mAccumulator
 * until the refresh driver returns a new timestamp for MostRecentRefresh().
 *
 * When there is a new timestamp from the refresh driver, the accumulated
 * change in scroll position is divided by the delta of the timestamp to
 * get an average velocity over that period.  This velocity is pushed into
 * mQueue as a std::pair associating each velocity with the
 * duration over which it was sampled.
 *
 * Samples are removed from mQueue, leaving only those necessary to determine
 * the average velocity over the recent relevant period, which has a duration
 * set by the apz.velocity_relevance_time_ms preference.
 *
 * The velocity of each sample is clamped to a value set by the
 * layout.css.scroll-snap.prediction-max-velocity.
 *
 * As the average velocity will later be integrated over a duration set by
 * the layout.css.scroll-snap.prediction-sensitivity preference and the
 * velocity samples are clamped to a set value, the maximum expected scroll
 * offset can be calculated.  This maximum offset is used to clamp
 * mAccumulator, eliminating samples that would otherwise result in scroll
 * snap position selection that is not consistent with the user's perception
 * of scroll velocity.
