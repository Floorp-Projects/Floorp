/**
 * nsFloatManager is responsible for implementing CSS's rules for
 * positioning floats. An nsFloatManager object is created during reflow for
 * any block with NS_BLOCK_BFC_STATE_BITS. During reflow, the float manager for
 * the nearest such ancestor block is found in ReflowInput::mFloatManager.
 *
 * According to the line-relative mappings in CSS Writing Modes spec [1],
 * line-right and line-left are calculated with respect to the writing mode
 * of the containing block of the floats. All the writing modes passed to
 * nsFloatManager methods should be the containing block's writing mode.
 *
 * However, according to the abstract-to-physical mappings table [2], the
 * 'direction' property of the containing block doesn't affect the
 * interpretation of line-right and line-left. We actually implement this by
 * passing in the writing mode of the block formatting context (BFC), i.e.
 * the of BlockReflowState's writing mode.
 *
 * nsFloatManager uses a special logical coordinate space with inline
 * coordinates on the line-axis and block coordinates on the block-axis
 * based on the writing mode of the block formatting context. All the
 * physical types like nsRect, nsPoint, etc. use this coordinate space. See
 * FloatInfo::mRect for an example.
