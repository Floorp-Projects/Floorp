<p>Edit: Wow, quick response there!  Thanks for the pointers guys, looks like the dbginfo
packages are there, just take a bit to get to.  I had installed the dbg packages (or at
least some of them, the ones that I saw with apt-cache search dbg that were relevant), but
there wasn&#8217;t coverage for some packages &#8212; in particular the x server.  I&#8217;m
going to try Travis&#8217;s suggestion, thanks!</p>
