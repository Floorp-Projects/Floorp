  A test case for a transform animation frame is positioned by specifying
  left property (i.e. not transform property) so that if we didn't factor the

  jank at wrong positions.

    Put an SVG element so that the transform display item has a blob on
    WebRender which means this test properly fails without the proper fix.

    The pre-render area width is 1125px, thus the expanded area outside of the
    visible area is 325px. The 325px width is expaned to both directions,
    leftward and rightward. Meanwhile, the horizontal visible frame range is
    [200px, 1000px] because of `left: -200px`, so the left edge of the
    pre-render area is 37.5px (= 200 - 325/2), the right edge is 1162.5px
    (= 1000 + 325/2).
