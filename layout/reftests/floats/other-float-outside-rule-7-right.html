  CSS2.1 9.5.1 rule 7 says:

    A left-floating box that has another left-floating box to its left
    may not have its right outer edge to the right of its containing
    block's right edge. (Loosely: a left float may not stick out at the
    right edge, unless it is already as far to the left as possible.) An
    analogous rule holds for right-floating elements.

<!-- the block formatting context inside which we're testing -->
<div style="float: left; width: 500px; height: 500px">

  <div style="float: right; width: 50px; height: 300px"></div>

  <div style="margin-right: 100px"> <!-- 400px wide -->

    <!-- we're testing the position of this float -->
    <div style="float: right; width: 425px; height: 10px; background: blue"></div>

  </div>
