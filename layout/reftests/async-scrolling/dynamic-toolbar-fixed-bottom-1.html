<!--
  Tests that setting a fixed bottom margin in AsyncCompositionManager results
  in the margin being applied to an element fixed to the bottom.

  The fixed margin is specified as a test-pref in reftest.list.

  The purpose of the fixed margin is to compensate for the transform that the
  dynamic toolbar applies to the entire content area. We don't have a way of
  simulating that transform in a reftest, so the fixed margin in isolation will
  cause the fixed element to be offset from the bottom of the screen, and in
  the ref page we use a regular CSS "margin-bottom" to match the rendering.
