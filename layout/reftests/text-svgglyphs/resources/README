.woff files for SVG-in-OpenType testing
=======================================

There are three .woff files in this directory:
 * nosvg.woff
 * svg.woff
 * rubbish.woff

nosvg.woff
----------
This font is FiraSansOT-Regular, with its metrics hacked so that its ascent
is 1000 and descent is 0. Its unitsPerEm value is 1000.

It contains no 'SVG ' table.

svg.woff
--------
This font is the same as nosvg.woff above, but with the glyphs-*.svg SVG
documents from this directory embedded in it using the tools described below.

rubbish.woff
------------
This font is the same as nosvg.woff above, but with the addition of an 'SVG '
table with the contents of rubbish.txt. Its purpose is to test that SVG tables
without valid XML are ignored.

Creating the Fonts
------------------
The tools used here are insertsvg.py from [1] and sfnt2woff from [2].

svg.woff can be recreated with:

woff2sfnt nosvg.woff > nosvg.ttf
insertsvg.py nosvg.ttf svg.ttf glyphs-*.svg
sfnt2woff svg.ttf

svg-glyph-extents.otf
---------------------

This is a copy of Fira Sans with a simple SVG table added using the tool from
https://github.com/rocallahan/svg-opentype-workshop. The SVG table defines four
glyphs, corresponding to 'A' through 'D':

 <svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'>
   <rect id='glyph36' x='0' y='-1000' width='1000' height='1500' fill='red'/>
   <rect id='glyph37' x='0' y='-1000' width='1000' height='1500' fill='green' transform='scale(2)'/>
   <g id='glyph38'>
     <rect x='0' y='-1000' width='1000' height='1500' fill='red'/>
   </g>
   <g id='glyph39'>
     <rect x='0' y='-1000' width='1000' height='1500' fill='green' transform='scale(2)'/>
   </g>
 </svg>
