# These tests check whether the GPU process is working. We expect it to work if:
#   E10S is enabled, and
#   Direct2D 1.1 works (as a proxy for Windows 7 SP1 + Platform Update or higher), OR
#   The GPU process has been forced on.
# If these conditions are met, but the GPU process is not on, these tests will turn on
# and compare false.
