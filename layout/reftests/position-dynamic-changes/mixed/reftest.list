# This directory includes 7 different permutations of the same tests.
# reftest_plain.list is the manifest file for tests without any border, margin
# or padding applied to either the abs-pos element or the parent.
# reftest_{prop}_{element}.list files are the manifest files for tests with the
# CSS property {prop} applied to {element}.  These files use the query string
# on the test file and the reference file to ask the code in ../handleprop.js add
# the corresponding CSS style.

# Any changes to the contents of the following files needs to be reflected on
# all of them.
