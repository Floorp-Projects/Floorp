# LIST OF REFTEST NEED TO SKIP FROM IMPORTS
#
# Always consider adding tests to failures.list first if it doesn't
# pass. This list should only be used if we are not able to make the
# test itself work, e.g. some dynamic tests.
#
# The syntax of this file is as follows:
#    1) All lines marked with a '#' are comments.
#    2) A failure is denoted by a path, starting
#       with module. E.g.:
#         css3-multicol/block-clip-001.xht

# because of dynamic change
css-values-3/vh_not_refreshing_on_chrome.html
css-values-3/vh_not_refreshing_on_chrome_iframe.html

# because of support files (in iframe subdir) not being copied (bug 1256580)
css-values-3/vh-support-transform-origin.html
css-values-3/vh-support-transform-translate.html

# because the test fails on OS X 10.10 (and probably other platforms with certain font antialiasing)
css-values-3/ch-unit-001.html
