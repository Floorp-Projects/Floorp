# LIST OF REFTEST NEED TO SKIP FROM IMPORTS
#
# Always consider adding tests to failures.list first if it doesn't
# pass. This list should only be used if we are not able to make the
# test itself work, e.g. some dynamic tests.
#
# The syntax of this file is as follows:
#    1) All lines marked with a '#' are comments.
#    2) A failure is denoted by a path, starting
#       with module. E.g.:
#         css3-multicol/block-clip-001.xht
