# LIST OF REFTEST FAILURES FROM IMPORTS
#
# The syntax of this file is as follows:
#    1) All lines marked with a '#' are comments. Comments can also be written
#       at the end of the line, which are copied to the auto-generated
#       received/reftest.list.
#    2) A failure is denoted by <failure-type>* (as described in
#       layout/tools/reftest/README.txt) and a path pattern starting
#       with module. E.g.:
#       fails css-values/attr-*.html
#
# If a test matches multiple path pattern, the last one wins. Because
# of this, an item could have zero <failure-type>, which indicates it
# is expected to pass, and override failure rule above it.
