<!-- Bidi reftest 006: rtl text with diacritics. This is hard to reftest
     because if there is a bug it will typically be exhibited in the reference
     rendering as well as in the test. The approach adopted here is to
     position boxes around the edges of the character without a diacritic and
     make sure that the character with the diacritic displays in the same
     space, so that if the diacritic is shifted to the right or left it will
     be cut off in the test rendering and be visible (in the wrong place) in
     the reference rendering.
