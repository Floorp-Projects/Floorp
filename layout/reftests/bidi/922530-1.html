	Test that U+061C functions as an invisible Arabic character.

	In the test text it is followed by two European numbers with a
	European separator between them. By rules W2, W3 and W6 of the
	Bidi algorithm (http://unicode.org/reports/tr9/#W2) the
	European numbers change to Arabic numbers, the ARABIC LETTER
	MARK changes to R and the separator changes to Other Neutral,
	and then by rule N1 the Arabic numbers make the separator
	change to R, so the final visual order is "a2+1&#x061c;", but
	the &#x061c should not appear
      -->
