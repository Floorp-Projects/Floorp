    BitPattern.woff is a font with a glyph for each mirrored character.
    (The glyph is a bit pattern of the character's code point, hence the
    font name.)  The font was generated by:
    
      1. Creating an input file that consisted of a four-hex-digit code
         point per line, for each glyph to be included in the font.
         (For this test, that would be the 360-odd mirrored characters.)

      2. Running ./generate-bitpattern-font.pl on that input file, which
         generates an SVG Font file.

      3. Using FontForge to convert that SVG Font file into a WOFF file.
