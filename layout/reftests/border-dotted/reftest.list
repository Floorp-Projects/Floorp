# Composing dotted/dashed border rendering and not-filled or not-unfilled mask
# matches to full-filled box, using fuzzyy because of anti-aliasing.
# These check filled and unfilled regions with solid opaque color,
# so difference less than 80 is ignorable.

# XXX: We mark fails-if to these tests for now to enable styled border in WR.
# We should remove them after Bug 1399485 is fixed.
