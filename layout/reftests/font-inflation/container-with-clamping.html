Without the patch for bug 707855, we have a 450px container, and the minimum font size
at 15em per line is 30px. This means we map 0px-45px into 30px-45px, so 12px gets mapped
to 34px.

With the patch, then we have a 240px container, so the minimum font size
at 15 em per line is 16px. So, we map 0px-24px into 16px-24px, so 12px gets
mapped to 20px.
