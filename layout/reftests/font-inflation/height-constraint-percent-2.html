<!--
In a 450px container, the minimum font size at 15em per line is 30px.
This means we map 0px-45px into 30px-45px, so 12px gets mapped to 34px.

    <p>Life and death, dreaming and wakefulness: stations for the perplexed soul. It traverses them by stage, taking signs and hints from things, groping about in the sea of darkness, clinging stubbornly to a hope that smilingly and mysteriously renews itself. Traveler, what are you searching for? What emotions rage in your heart?</p>
