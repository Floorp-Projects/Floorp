Without the patch for bug 706198, this website should not show up as inflated. That means
that with a 450px container, the minimum font size with 15em per line should be 30px.
So, we map 0px-45px into 30px-45px, and thus 12px gets mapped to 34px.

With the patch, the text should be uninflated, which means that 12px should still be
12px.
