	  Most systems are expected to have either Linotype's Helvetica or a
	  substitute.  These are needed for PostScript or PDF support.  MS
	  systems will have Monotype's Arial installed.  Systems with
	  ghostscript will normally have Nimbus Sans L.  Linux systems without
	  ghostscript may have Adobe's bitmap Helvetica for X11 or Ascender /
	  Red Hat's Liberation Sans.

	  The result will be compared with fonts chosen through font-family.
	  Platform aliases (on Windows and Linux) will map family names from
	  one substitute to another, but similar aliasing does not happen with
	  face names in local().  Therefore, all Helvetica substitute fonts
	  are included in the @font-face rules.

	  Full names are specified for all fonts for MS Windows and Linux, and
	  PostScript names are included for Mac for all fonts up to
	  Helvetica, which is expected to be on every Mac.

	  The generic fallback is chosen to be serif, which is not expected to
	  be the same as any of the local (sans-serif) faces in the @font-face
	  rules, so that it makes failure to reference the local faces more
	  obvious.
