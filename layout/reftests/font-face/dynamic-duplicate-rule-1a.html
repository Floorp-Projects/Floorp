<!-- Testcase for bug 879963 regression.
     We have two <style> elements with identical @font-face rules, which will
     share a common proxy font entry. When the entry is loaded, the references
     in both rules must be updated, otherwise text may disappear if the "wrong"
     (non-updated) rule is subsequently used.
     By disabling the first style element after the document has loaded (and the
     user font has been resolved to a real font entry), we can check that the
     second rule also works as expected.
     Note that if a platform doesn't have any of the local() fonts listed,
     the testcase will "pass" harmlessly as a no-op. -->
