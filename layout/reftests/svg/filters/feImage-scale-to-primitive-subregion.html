<title>feImage Rendering Should Scale To Its Primitive Subregion</title>
<!--
  Test for https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1065606

  This test verifies that an feImage renders as large as its primitive subregion
  before being clipped by its filter region.

  In this case, the primitive subregion is 600x600. The filter region is equal
  to the bounding box of the filtered element (100% x 30px).

  Thus, the 1x1 green pixel feImage rendering should scale up to the 600x600
  primitive subregion and then be clipped by the 100% x 30px filter region.
  Assuming the browser window is more than 600px wide, the final rendering
  should be a 600x30 green rectangle.
