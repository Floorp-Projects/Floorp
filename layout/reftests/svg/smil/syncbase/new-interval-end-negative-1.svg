  <!--
    Test a dependency with a negative offset that occurs at the end of another
    interval.

    This is one of the most important tests in the suite.

    REALLY IMPORTANT: Suppose we generate a new instance time, placed at a
    particular instant during the previous interval. In fact, correct behavior
    depends on *when* we generate this instance time. If we generate it AFTER
    the previous interval has ended, then the new instance time will be
    IGNORED. However, if we generate it BEFORE the previous interval has ended
    (and if restart="always"), then a new interval will be generated, and the
    animation will restart.
    (To be absolutely clear: above, the words "AFTER" and "BEFORE" describe
    *when the instance time is generated*, as opposed to *where on the timeline
    the instance time is placed*).

    So, if a new instance time is generated at the same time as an interval is
    due to end what should happen? SMIL's endpoint-exclusive timing seems to
    imply that interval ends should be processed first and hence the new
    instance time should be ignored. Opera, WebKit and Batik seem to agree on
    this.

    Hence why this test is so important. It tests that we are actually
    processing ends first.
