    Test that we don't apply an early end too soon.

    Although the second animation will have an interval from 2s-6s, it shouldn't
    be informed about this until the early end happens, at t=3s. Until that time
    it should be expecting to start at t=4s.

    If the second animation is started at t=2s it means the early end has been
    applied too soon.
