  <!--
    Test an early end where two times could be chosen for the following
    interval.
    (As before but with a negative offset and with the second animation getting
    overlapping intervals from a's begin times, with one such interval being
    rejected since it overlaps an already-completed interval when it's
    created.)

    Details: At time t=1.75, we generate an interval starting at 1.35 for the
    second animation.  However, this overlaps that animation's already-complete
    previous interval from 0.4s to 1.4s (which is "already complete" because
    we're at t=1.75, past its end at 1.4s). So, the new interval is rejected.
