    Simple case of a negative offset before the syncbase has begun.

    SMILANIM 3.3.6 Propagating changes to times has:

      When an element begins or ends, the time dependents of the element are
      effectively notified of the action, and the schedule for the time
      dependents may be affected. Note than an element must actually begin
      before any of the time dependents (dependent on the begin) are affected,
      and that an element must actually end before any of the time dependents
      (dependent on the end) are affected.

    This would suggest that a time dependent that is defined to start BEFORE its
    syncbase does not actually start until the syncbase starts. However Opera,
    WebKit, and Batik all agree that when we know when the syncbase will start,
    we resolve the negative offset in advance.
