    Test of animation sandwich priority based on syncbase dependencies.

    This chain goes through end and begin specs but SMIL seems to imply that
    it's only when one element's begin time is dependent on another's begin time
    that it affects the chaining because it should act as if the time base begun
    before the the dependent.  So in this case 'c' is (indirectly) dependent on
    'a's end time and so shouldn't be given the higher priority.
