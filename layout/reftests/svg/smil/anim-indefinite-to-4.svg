  <!-- This is not really a to-animation, but we want to check that set
       animation isn't incorrectly treated as to-animation.

       Provided the attribute being animated is interpolatable (as it is in this
       case) and calcMode != discrete, to-animation will begin from the base
       value (and never change in this case as the simple duration is
       indefinite).

       Set animation, however, never sets the base value, only the to value. -->
