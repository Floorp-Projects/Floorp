    Test that we correctly handle "HasChanged()" flags when an animation becomes
    inactive while its siblings haven't changed.
    In this test case, we take our first sample at 1s, and both animations are
    active. We take our second sample at 2s, and the first animation is the only
    active animation. It hasn't changed, so we might think that we don't need to
    recompose its target - BUT we *do* need to recompose, because the other
    animation is newly inactive, and we need to reevaluate the animation
    sandwich now that it's gone.
