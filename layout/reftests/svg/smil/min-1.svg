  <!-- Test min behavior

       Set up is as follows:
       1. There is a rectangle with a lime fill.
       2. A <set> animation (with default fill="none") sets the fill to
          orange at t=100s.
          It has a simple duration of 10s and a min duration of 20s.
       3. A further <set> animation sets the fill to red when the first
          animation finishes (using syncbase timing).

       At time t=115s we should still be in the first animation's active
       interval with its fill mode of 'none' applied which should mean the
       original lime fill is used. -->
