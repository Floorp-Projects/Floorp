<!-- This SVG file uses itself as an image.  Currently, we don't paint
     recursively-referenced images beyond the first level.  When this testcase
     is viewed directly, it gets treated as a document (not an image), so its
     <image> element is painted.  However, the <image>'s own *internal* <image>
     element does *not* get painted.  So we end up painting two blue circles:
     one for the <circle> and one for the <image>'s <circle> (and no more). -->
