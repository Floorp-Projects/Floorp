  <!-- This trivial SMIL animation ensures that we *won't* get repainted via

       the SurfaceCache so that we can ensure that repaints of this file (as an
       image) will *actually repaint the SVG content*, rather than painting a
       previously-rasterized snapshot (which may've been rasterized before we
       had any chance to consider :visited styles). -->
