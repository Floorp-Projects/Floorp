  <!-- This path is really 400 units long (and its halfway point is at the
       right edge of our viewBox). We use pathLength to normalize its length
       to 20, though, so the first 5-unit-long dash in stroke-dasharray ends
       up covering 5/20 = 1/4 of the path. The hole in the dasharray spans 
       the viewBox -->
