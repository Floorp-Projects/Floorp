  <title>Test stroke-dashoffset with pathLength</title>
  <!--
    The path is much longer than 100 user units, so if the pathLength is not
    factored into the stroke-dashoffset calculation, the stroke will be visible.
    A correct implementation will see the first dash pushed off the end of the
    path which will mean that the path does not display at all.

    path {
      fill: none;
      stroke-width: 5;
      stroke: red;
      stroke-dasharray: 100;
      stroke-dashoffset: 100;
    }
  </style>

  <path pathLength="100" d="M175,25 A150,150,0,1,1,175,325 A150,150,0,1,1,175,25"/>
