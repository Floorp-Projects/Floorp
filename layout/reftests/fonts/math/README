The fonts in this directory are autogenerated with FontForge using the Python
script generate.py. See the comments in that file for more information on how
to run the script.

These fonts are intended to test the The MATH table and OpenType Features used
in MathML. See layout/reftests/mathml/ and layout/mathml/tests.
