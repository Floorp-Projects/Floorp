     This testcase ensures that we paint the background around an opaque image,
     when the image is offset from the container via 'object-position' (and
     the img element is fragmented). This is an interesting case because, by
     default, images fill their container, which means we can often optimize
     away the background completely. BUT, if "object-position" offsets the
     image from its container's content-box, we can't optimize away the
     background; it need to be painted in the uncovered area.
