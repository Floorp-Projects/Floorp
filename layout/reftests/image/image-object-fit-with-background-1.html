     This testcase ensures that we paint the background around an opaque image,
     when the image is kept from filling the container via 'object-fit'. This
     is an interesting case because, by default, images fill their container,
     which means we can often optimize away the background completely. BUT, if
     "object-fit" prevents the image from filling its container, we can't
     optimize away the background; it need to be painted in the uncovered area.
