  'If the letters that would form the first-letter are not in the same element,
   such as "'T" in <p>'<em>T..., the UA may create a first-letter
   pseudo-element from one of the elements, both elements, or simply not create
   a pseudo-element.'
  So it's not necessarily a bug if this test fails, but I'm including it anyway
  to track whether the behaviour changes. The current behaviour at the time of
  creating the test is that only the first element is included in the
  pseudo-element.
