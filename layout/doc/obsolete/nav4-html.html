HTML</H2>
This documents describes the complete handling of HTML in magellan. The
document covers the parsing process - how HTML is lexically analysized
and then interprted. After the parsing process is discussed we give a detailed
analysis of each HTML tag and the attributes that are supported, the values
for the attributes and how the tag is treated by magellan.
<H2>
Parsing</H2>
HTML is tokenized by an HTML scanner. The scanner is fed unicode data to
parse. Stream converters are used to translate from various encodings to
unicode. The scanner separates the input stream into tokens which consist
of:
<UL>
<LI>
text</LI>

<LI>
tags</LI>

<LI>
entities</LI>

<LI>
script-entities</LI>

<LI>
comments</LI>

<LI>
conditional comments</LI>
</UL>
The HTML parsing engine uses the HTML scanner for lexical anlaysis. The
parsing engine operates by attacking the input stream in a set of well
defined steps:
<UL>
<LI>
The parser processes the head portion of the document first, without emitting
any output. This is done to discover a few special features of html:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
The parser processes META tags looking for META TARGET</LI>

<LI>
The parser processes META tags looking for META tags which affect the character
set. Nav4 handles the very first character set defining meta tag (all others
are ignored) by reloading the document with the proper character conversion
module inserted into the stream pipeline.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
After the head portion is processed the parser then proceeds to process
the body of the document</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Tag Processing</H3>
Tags are processed by the parser by locating a <B>"tag handler"</B> for
the tag. The HTML parser serves as the tag handler for all of the builtin
tags documented below. Tag attribute handling is done during translation
of tags into content. This mapping translates the tag attributes into content
data and into style data. The translation to style data is documented below
by indicating the mapping from tag attributes to their CSS1 (plus extensions)
equivalents.
<H3>
Special Hacks</H3>
The following list describes hacks added to the magellan parsing engine
to deal with navigator compatibility. These are just the parser hacks,
not the layout or presentation hacks. Most hacks are intriduced for HTML
syntax error recovering. HTML doesn't specify much how to handle those
error conditions. Netscape has made big effort to render pages with non-prefect
HTML. For many reasons, new browsers need to keep compatible in thsi area.
<UL>
<LI>
Entities can be used as escape in quoted string. For value string in name-value
pair,&nbsp; see <A HREF="../testhtml/quote001.html">compatibility test
quote001.html</A>. Test line 70 shows that an entity quote at the begining
means the value is NOT quoted. Test line 90 shows that if the value is
started with a quote, then an entity quote does NOT terminate the value
string.</LI>

<LI>
Wrapping tags are special tags such as title, textarea, server, script,
style, and etc.. The comment in ns\lib\libparse\pa_parse.c says:</LI>

<BR>&nbsp; /*
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; * These tags are special in that, after opening one of
them, all other tags are ignored until the matching
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; * closing tag.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; */
<BR>During the searching of an end tag, comments and quoted strings are
observed. see <A HREF="../testhtml/title01.html">compatibility test title01.html</A>.
6.0 handles comments now, need to add quoted string.
<LI>
If a &lt;tr> or &lt;td> tag is seen outside any &lt;table> scope, it is
ignored. see <A HREF="../testhtml/table110.htm">compatibility test table110.htm</A>.</LI>

<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">In case of table in table but not in cell, table
tags before the last table tag are ignored. We found this problem in some
Netscape public pages, see bug #85118. For example, &lt;table> &lt;table
border> .....,or &lt;table> &lt;tr> &lt;table border>...,&nbsp; the table
will be displayed with border.&nbsp;</FONT> <A HREF="../testhtml/table201.html">compatibility
test table201.html</A>. There table and tr tags are buffered for this recovery.
When a TD or CAPTION tag is open, the buffer is flushed out, because we
cannot buffer contents of TD or CAPTION for performance and memory constrains.
They are subdoc's and can be very big. If we see a &lt;table> outside cell
after previous table is flushed out, the new &lt;table> tag is ignored.
Nav4.0 can discard previous table in such case. <A HREF="../testhtml/tableall.html">tableall.html
</A>is the index for table test cases.</LI>

<LI>
Caption is not a commonly used feature. In Nav4.0, captions can be anywhere.
For Captions outside cells, the first one takes effect. For captions inside
cells, the last one takes effect, and they also close TD and TR. In 6.0,
caption is limited to the standard position: after &lt;table>. Captions
in other places are ignored, their contents are treated as text. See test
case table05a.html to table05o.html.</LI>

<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">For &lt;table> &lt;tr> &lt;tr>, the first &lt;tr>
takes effect.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
The nav4 parser notices when it hits EOF and it's in the middle of scanning
in a comment. When this happens, the parser goes back and looks for an
improperly closed comment (e.g. a simple > instead of a -->). If it finds
one, it reparses the input after closing out the comment.</LI>

<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">XXX Brendan also pointed out that there is something
similar done for tags, but I don't recall what it is right now.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">When Nav4.0 sees the '&lt;' sign, it searchs for
'>', observing quoted values. If it cannot find one till EOF, the '&lt;'
sign is treated as text. In Xena 6.0, a limit is set for how far the '>'
is searched. the default limit is 4096 char, and there is a API HTMLScanner.setMaxTagLength()
to changed it. setting -1 means no limit, which is same as Nav4.0.</FONT></LI>

gets pushed on the alignment stack. All values are supported by nav4.
<BR>Attributes:
<UL><B>ALIGN</B>=divalign</UL>

<BR>Attributes: none</UL>
<B>PRE</B>
<UL>Closes the paragraph. The open tag does a hard line break. A fixed

<B>DIV</B>
<UL>Closes the paragraph. Always does a conditional soft line break. COLS
defines the number of columns to layout in (like MULTICOL). The open tag
pushes an alignment on the alignment stack (if COLS > 1 then it pretends
to be a MULTICOL tag). The close tag pops an aligment from the alignment

<B>H1-H6</B>
<UL>Closes the paragraph. The open tag does a hard line break and pushes
a style item which enables bold and disables fixed and italic. The close
tag always pops the top item from the style stack. It also does a hard
line break. If the <B>ALIGN</B> attribute is present then the open tag
pushes an alignment on the alignment stack. The close tag will look at
the top of the alignment stack and if its a header of any kind (H1 through
H6) then the alignment is popped. In either case the close tag also does
a conditional soft line break (this happens before the hard line break).

A note regarding closing paragraphs: Any time a close paragraph is done
(for any tag) if the top of the alignment stack has a tag named "P" then
a conditional soft line break is done and the alignment is popped.

<B>MULTICOL</B>
<UL>The open tag does a hard line break. The close tag checks to see if
the state machine has an open multicol and if it does then it does a conditional
soft line break and then continues to break until both margins are cleared
of floating elements. It recomputes the margins based on the list indenting
level (?). After the synthetic table is output the close tag does a hard
line break.

<P>This tag will treat the input as source for a table with one row and

the top item from the style stack.
<BR>Attributes: none</UL>
<B>SUP, SUB</B>
<UL>The open tag pushes a font size descrease on the style stack. The close
tag always pops the top of the style stack. The open and close tag impacts
the baselineThe only difference between SUP and SUB is how they impact
the baseline. Note that the baseline information is forgotten after a line
break; therefore a close SUP/SUB on the next line will do strange things.
<BR>Attributes: none</UL>
<B>SPAN</B>
<UL>Ignored by the navigator.
<BR>Attributes: none</UL>
<B>FONT</B>
<UL>The open font tag with no attributes resets the font size to the base
font size. The open tag always pushes a style stack entry. The close tag
always pops the top item off the style stack.
<BR>Attributes:
<UL><B>SIZE</B>=[+ int | - int | int ]&nbsp; [clamped: >=1 &amp;&amp; &lt;=
7]
<BR><B>POINT-SIZE=</B>[+ int | - int | int ] [clamped: >= 1 &amp;&amp;

</UL>
A note regarding the style stack: The pop of the stack checks to see if
the top of the stack is an ANCHOR tag. If it is not an anchor then the
top item is unconditionally popped. If the top of the style stack is an
anchor tag then the code searches for either the bottom of the stack or
the first style stack entry not created by an anchor tag. If the entry
is followed by another entry then the entry is removed from the stack (an
out-of-order pop in other words). In this case the anchor style stack entry
is left untouched.

<B>text, entities</B>
<UL>These are basic content objects that get fed directly to the output.
In navigator the text is processed by doing line-breaking (entities have
been converted to text already by the parser). The line-breaking is controlled
by the margin settings and the list depth, the floating elements, the style
attributes (font size, etc.), the preformatted flag, the no-break flag
and so on.</UL>
<B>IMG, IMAGE</B>
<UL>Close tag is ignored.
<BR>Attributes:

</UL>
<B>HR</B>
<UL>Closes the paragraph. If an open tag then does a conditional soft line
break. The rule inherits alignment from the parent container unless there
is no container (then it's centered) or if the tag defines it's own alignment.
After the object is inserted into the layout stream a soft line break is
inserted as well.
<BR>Attributes:
<UL><B>ALIGN</B>=divalign (sort of; in laytags.c it's divalign; in layhrule.c
it's left or right only)
<BR><B>SIZE</B>=int (1 to 100 inclusive)
<BR><B>WIDTH</B>=val-or-pct (pct of <TT>right-left</TT> width)
<BR><B>NOSHADE</B></UL>
</UL>
<B>BR</B>
<UL>Does an unconditional soft break. If clear is set then it will also
soft break until either the left or right or both margins are clear of
floating elements. Note that<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"> /BR == BR!</FONT>
<BR>Attributes:
<UL><B>CLEAR</B>=left | right | all | both</UL>
</UL>
<B>WBR</B>
<UL>Soft word break.
<BR>Attributes: none</UL>
<B>EMBED</B>
<UL>Close tag does nothing. Embed's operate inline just like images (they
don't close the paragraph).
<BR>Attributes:

<BR><B>VSPACE</B>=int [clamped: >= 0]
<BR><B>HSPACE</B>=int [clamped: >= 0]</UL>
</UL>
<B>NOEBMED</B>
<UL>Used when EMBED's are disabled. It is a container for regular content
that has no stylistic consequences (no line breaking, no style stack effect,
etc.).</UL>
<B>APPLET</B>
<UL>Applet tags don't nest (there is a notion of current_applet). The open
tag automatically closes an open applet tag.
<BR>Attributes:
<UL><B>ALIGN</B>=alignparam
<BR><B>CODE</B>=string
<BR><B>CODEBASE</B>=string
<BR><B>ARCHIVE</B>=string
<BR><B>MAYSCRIPT</B>

<BR><B>VSPACE</B>=int [clamped: >= 0]</UL>
If no width is provided:
<UL>if a height was provided, use the height. Otherwise, use 90% of the
window width if percentage widths are allowed, otherwise use a value of
600.
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>
If no height is provided:
<UL>if a width was provided, use the width. Otherwise, use 50% of the window
height if percentage widths are allowed, otherwise use a value of 400.</UL>
If the applet is hidden, then the widht/height get forced to zero.</UL>
<B>PARAM</B>
<UL>The param tag is supported when contained by the APPLET tag or the
OBJECT tag. It has no stylistic consequences. The attribute values from
the tag are passed to the containing APPLET or OBJECT. Note that <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">/PARAM
== PARAM</FONT>.
<BR>Attributes:
<UL><B>NAME</B>=string [clamped: white space is stripped out]
<BR><B>VALUE</B>=string [clamped: white space is stripped out]</UL>
White space being stripped is done as follows: leading and trailing whitespace
is removed. Any embedded whitespace is left alone except if it's a non-space
whitespace in which case it is removed.</UL>
<B>OBJECT</B>
<UL>The open tag pushes an object onto the object stack. The close tag
pops from the object stack. I don't understand how the data stuff works.
<BR>Attributes:
<UL><B>CLASSID</B>=string (clsid:, java:, javaprogram:, javabean: are the
supported prefixes; maybe it's a url if no prefix shown?)
<BR><B>TYPE</B>=string (a mime type)
<BR><B>DATA</B>=string (data: prefix mentions a url)</UL>
There are more attributes that depend on the type of object being embedded
in the page. If the object is a java bean (?) then the applet parameters
are supported:
<UL>CLASSID
<BR>HIDDEN
<BR>ALIGN
<BR>CLASSID (instead of CODE)
<BR>CODEBASE
<BR>ARCHIVE
<BR>MAYSCRIPT
<BR>ID (applets use NAME)
<BR>WIDTH
<BR>HEIGHT
<BR>BORDER
<BR>HSPACE
<BR>VSPACE</UL>
</UL>
<B>MAP</B>
<UL>The open tag automatically closes an open map (maps don't nest). There
is no stylistic consequence of the map nor does it provide any visible
presentation in the normal layout case (an editor would do something different).
The map can be declared anywhere in the document.
<BR>Attributes:
<UL><B>NAME</B>=string [clamped: white space is stripped out]</UL>
</UL>
<B>AREA</B>
<UL>Does nothing if there is no current map or the tag is a close tag.
<BR>Attributes:
<UL><B>SHAPE</B>=default | rect | circle | poly | polygon
<BR><B>ALT</B>=string [clamped: newlines are stripped]
<BR><B>COORDS</B>=coord-list

<UL><B>TARGET</B>=target (only if HREF is specified)</UL>
<B>SUPPRESS</B></UL>
</UL>
<B>SERVER</B>
<UL>A container for server-side javascript. Not evaluated by the client
(parsed and ignored). Note: The navigator parser doesn't expand entities
in a <B>SERVER </B>tag.</UL>
<B>SPACER</B>
<UL>Close tag is ignored. Open tag provides whitespace during layout: <B>TYPE</B>=line/vert/vertical
causes a conditional soft line break and then adds <B>SIZE </B>to the Y
layout coordinate. <B>TYPE</B>=word causes a conditional soft word break
and then adds <B>SIZE </B>to the X layout coordinate. <B>TYPE</B>=block
causes <FONT COLOR="#DD0000">blockish </FONT>layout stuff to happen.
<BR>Attributes:
<UL><B>TYPE</B>=line | vert | vertical | block (default: word)
<UL><B>ALIGN</B>=alignparam (these 3 params are only for <B>TYPE</B>=block)
<BR><B>WIDTH</B>=value-or-pct
<BR><B>HEIGHT</B>=value-or-pct</UL>
