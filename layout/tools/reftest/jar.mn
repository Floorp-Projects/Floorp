# Android doesn't ship global.css
# Accessing missing non-test chrome:// files crashes, to avoid relying on
# non-existing files.
# A bunch of our older crash- and reftests use it, and it's unclear to what
# extent they rely on it (ie removing the CSS file may stop the tests testing
# what they are supposed to test on OSes that do ship global.css).
# We also would like to move towards shipping less and less XUL/ex-XBL files
# on android, so adding it everywhere doesn't seem like the right direction.
# Instead, add an empty file only for reftests:
