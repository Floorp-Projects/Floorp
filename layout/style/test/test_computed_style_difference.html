<title>Test that the difference of the computed style of an element is always correctly propagated</title>
<!--
  There are CSS property changes that don't have an effect in computed style.

  It's relatively easy to return `nsChangeHint(0)` for the case where the
  property changes but it should have no rendering difference.

  That's however incorrect, since if it's an inherited property, or a
  descendant explicitly inherits it, we should still propagate the change
  downwards.

  This test tests that computed style diffing is correct.
