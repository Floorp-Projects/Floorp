<!-- This is a reference case for a "2-pages-per-sheet" scenario with nonzero
     unwriteable margins. We expect the pages to have a 0.5x scale-down
     factor. That 0.5 scale-factor comes from the fact that, when rendering the
     testcase, we'll need to scale the page-width (8in) down enough to fit
     side-by-side into half of the sheet's available width (with the sheet
     having been rotated to landscape mode), with the sheet's unwritable margin
     having already been subtracted out. The sheet's width (in landscape mode)
     is 10in, and its unwriteable margin in that axis is 2in, so it's got 8in
     of available width to hold two side-by-side pages, i.e. 4in per page.
     Since the page width was 8in, that makes for a 0.5x scale. -->
