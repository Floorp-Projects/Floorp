<!-- This is a reference case for a "2-pages-per-sheet" scenario. The width and
     height of each "swatch" is 0.625 the width and height of the page.  That
     0.625 scale-factor comes from the fact that, when rendering the testcase,
     we'll need to scale the page-width (8in) down enough to fit side-by-side
     into half of the page height (10in/2 = 5in), on a rotated sheet.  So we've
     got to scale 8in to fit into 5in, which is a scale factor of 0.625. -->
