<!-- This is a reference case for a "9-pages-per-sheet" scenario. This file is
     a mockup of a sheet with 9 pages, with the pages all having a 0.2x scale
     scale factor applied. (We end up with that scale factor by subtracting the
     requested unwriteable margins from the sheet, and dividing up the
     remaining space equally among the "virtual pages".)  -->

     "centering" area in the axis that has extra space, which in this case is
     the vertical axis. These values come directly from the
     unwriteableMargin{Top,Right,Bottom,Left} values in this testcase's setup
     code in printpreview_helper.xhtml, with 1.7in added to margin-top and to
     margin-bottom, to vertically center the page-grid within the sheet's
     writeable area. */
