<!-- This is a reference case for a "4-pages-per-sheet" scenario. This file is
     a mockup of a sheet with 4 pages, with the pages all having a 0.4x scale
     scale factor applied. (We end up with that scale factor by subtracting the
     requested unwriteable margins from the sheet, and dividing up the
     remaining space equally among the "virtual pages".)  -->

     in the testcase.  They represent the unwriteable area, as well as the
     "centering" area in the axis that has extra space, which in this case is
     the horizontal axis. These values come directly from the
     unwriteableMargin{Top,Right,Bottom,Left} values in this testcase's setup
     code in printpreview_helper.xhtml, with 0.2in added to margin-right and
     margin-left, to horizontally center the page-grid within the sheet's
     writeable area. */
