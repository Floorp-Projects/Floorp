   * SVG is painted using a combination of display lists (trees of
   * nsDisplayItem built by BuildDisplayList() implementations) and recursive
   * PaintSVG calls.  SVG frames with the NS_FRAME_IS_NONDISPLAY bit set are
   * always painted using recursive PaintSVG calls since display list painting
   * would provide no advantages (they wouldn't be retained for invalidation).
   * Displayed SVG is normally painted via a display list tree created under
   * SVGOuterSVGFrame::BuildDisplayList, unless the
   * svg.display-lists.painting.enabled pref has been set to false by the user
   * in which case it is done via an SVGOuterSVGFrame::PaintSVG() call that
   * recurses over the entire SVG frame tree.  In future we may use PaintSVG()
   * calls on SVG container frames to avoid display list construction when it
   * is expensive and unnecessary (see bug 934411).
   *
   * @param aTransform The transform that has to be multiplied onto the
   *   DrawTarget in order for drawing to be in this frame's SVG user space.
   *   Implementations of this method should avoid multiplying aTransform onto
   *   the DrawTarget when possible and instead just pass a transform down to
   *   their children.  This is preferable because changing the transform is
   *   very expensive for certain DrawTarget backends so it is best to minimize
   *   the number of transform changes.
   *
   * @param aImgParams imagelib parameters that may be used when painting
   *   feImage.
