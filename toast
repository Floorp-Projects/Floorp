Hey Chris,

I apologize to ask this of you, but I was wondering if you might be able to find time to prioritize these data reviews today:

- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1835502 (Already done)

- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1836381 (new)

- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1836436 (new)

I've been working hard to try to get some of the most critical metrics implemented for our first round of QA testing
while Translations is enabled in Nightly and Early Beta. 

I apologize about the rushed nature of this. I've never done telemetry before and there was a lot of knowledge
to take in in a short time. 

My plan is to revisit these metrics and add more over the next month before our second round of beta testing.

If you think it would be better to set an expiration for these, rather than `never`, I think that's reasonable.

The ultimate intent is to have them never expire, but I realize these exact metrics may not be perfect or
idiomatic.

I'm also happy to make any changes today if you find something undesirable about them, but I'm really
hoping to land these during this soft freeze, given that it doesn't change any implementation details
(only adds telemetry), and we really want to have some measurements in this first early-beta cycle.
