   * `?VVV` syntax) and index (`?` and `?NNN`).
   *
   * This means, when chunking:
   *
   * - If you're binding 1 param per 1 value per chunk (for example, if you
   *   have a list of GUIDs and a clause like `WHERE guid IN (?, ?, ?, ...)`,
   *   your chunk length is just `variableLimit`.
   * - If you're binding 1 param per 1 value per chunk, but using that
   *   param in multiple positions in the query (for example, `WHERE url_hash
   *   IN (hash(?1), hash(?2), ...) AND url IN (?1, ?2, ...)`), you can use the
   *   `?NNN` syntax with a chunk length of `variableLimit`.
   * - If you're binding N params per 1 value per chunk (for example, if you
   *   have a list of items with GUIDs and parent GUIDs, and you want to bind
   *   both), your chunk length is `variableLimit / N`, since you're binding
   *   two params for each element.
   * - If you're binding K params per L values per chunk, plus M fixed ones
   *   (for example, `WHERE parentGuid = :parentGuid AND guid IN (?, ?, ...)`),
   *   your chunk length is `variableLimit - M`, to ensure there's space for the
   *   fixed variables.
   *
   * If you bind more params than this limit, `create{Async}Statement` will
   * fail with a "too many SQL variables" error.
