# This workflow triggers if .buildconfig.yml is changed on any of the
# release branches. It will ask the relbot action to create a release.
#
# Currently relbot has a hard-coded "current A-C" version; there is no
# relationship between what relbot does and on which branch the
# .builconfig.yml is updated. If the updated branch does not match with
# what relbot thinks is current, then nothing happens.
