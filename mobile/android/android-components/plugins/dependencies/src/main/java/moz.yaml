#
# moz.yaml file to configure updatebot to perform version bumps for
# nightly application-services builds; the version bump occurs in
# ApplicationServices.kt.
#
# Note that application-services is not really vendored here: All the
# normal vendoring steps are skipped and a custom action is used to
# do the version bump. This allows us to drive version bumps in updatebot
# and leverage updatebot's bug and patch creation.
