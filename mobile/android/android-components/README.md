telemetry-android
=================

A generic library for sending telemetry pings from Android applications to Mozilla's telemetry service.

## Motivation

The goal of this library is to provide a generic set of components to support a variety of telemetry use cases. It tries to not be opinionated about dependency injection frameworks or http clients. The only dependency is ``support-annotations`` to ensure code quality.
