## metrics
This is a built-in ping that is assembled out of the box by the Glean SDK.
See the Glean SDK documentation for the [`metrics` ping](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/metrics.html).
The following metrics are added to the ping:

| Name | Type | Description | Data reviews | Extras | Expiration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| crash_metrics.crash_count |[labeled_counter](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/labeled_counters.html) |Counts the number of crashes that occur in the application.  This measures only the counts of each crash in association with the labeled type of the crash. The labels correspond to the types of crashes handled by lib-crash.  |[1](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1553935#c3)||never |
