## bookmarks_sync
A ping sent for every bookmarks sync. It doesn't include the `client_id` because it reports a hashed version of the user's Firefox Account ID.

## history_sync
A ping sent for every history sync. It doesn't include the `client_id` because it reports a hashed version of the user's Firefox Account ID.

The following metrics are added to the ping:

| Name | Type | Description | Data reviews | Extras | Expiration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| history_sync.failure_reason |[labeled_string](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/labeled_strings.html) |Records why the history sync failed: either due to an authentication error, unexpected exception, or other error. The error strings are truncated and sanitized to omit PII, like URLs and file system paths.  |[1](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/pull/3092)||never |
| history_sync.finished_at |[datetime](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/datetime.html) |Records when the history sync finished. This includes the time to download, apply, and upload all records.  |[1](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/pull/3092)||never |
| history_sync.incoming |[labeled_counter](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/labeled_counters.html) |Records incoming history record counts. `applied` is the number of incoming history pages that were successfully stored or updated in the local database. `failed_to_apply` is the number of pages that were ignored due to errors. `reconciled` is the number of pages with new visits locally and remotely, and had their visits merged.  |[1](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/pull/3092)||never |
| history_sync.outgoing |[labeled_counter](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/labeled_counters.html) |Records outgoing history record counts. `uploaded` is the number of records that were successfully sent to the server. `failed_to_upload` is the number of records that weren't uploaded, and will be retried on the next sync.  |[1](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/pull/3092)||never |
| history_sync.outgoing_batches |[counter](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/counter.html) |Records the number of batches needed to upload all outgoing records. The Sync server has a hard limit on the number of records (and request body bytes) on the number of records that can fit into a single batch, and large syncs may require multiple batches.  |[1](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/pull/3092)||never |
| history_sync.started_at |[datetime](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/datetime.html) |Records when the history sync started.  |[1](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/pull/3092)||never |
