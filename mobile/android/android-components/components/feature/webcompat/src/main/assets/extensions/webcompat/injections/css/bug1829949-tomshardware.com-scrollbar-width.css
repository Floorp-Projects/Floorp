/**
 * tomshardware.com - a scrollbar covering navigation menu
 * Bug #1829949 - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1829949
 * WebCompat issue #121170 - https://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/issues/121170
 *
 * The scrollbar is covering navigation items and that makes them half hidden.
 * There are some ::-webkit-scrollbar css rules applied to the scrollbar,
 * making it thinner. Adding similar rules for Firefox fixes the issue.
