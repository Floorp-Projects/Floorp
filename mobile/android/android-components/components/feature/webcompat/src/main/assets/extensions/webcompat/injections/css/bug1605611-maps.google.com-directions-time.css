/**
 * Bug 1605611 - Cannot change Departure/arrival dates in Google Maps on Android
 *
 * Google Maps calls .click() on a datetime-local input element, with the intent
 * to show the native date picker. But the native date picker does not appear,
 * because that only happens when a user initiated the click.
 * To fix the problem of the date picker not appearing in Google Maps, alter the
 * styles of the datetime-local input element, to be rendered on top of the
 * usual UI (i.e. the icon and date/time text). This allows the user to summon
 * the native date picker when they tap on the relevant UI in Google Maps.

  /* position this (absolute) element to fully cover the parent container */
