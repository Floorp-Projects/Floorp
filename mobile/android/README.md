This repository currently hosts the [Mozilla Android Components](android-components/README.md) and [Focus (Android)](focus-android/README.md) projects. It is also the future home of [Fenix](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix), which will be [migrated in the coming weeks](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/26855).

Please file issues for Android Components in [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Fenix), selecting the corresponding component. Firefox Focus (Android) issues should now also be filed in [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Focus) under the Focus product.
