# This workflow periodically calls the relbot action to update GeckoView
# Beta.
#
# The relbot action will look at Maven and compare the latest GV Beta
# release available to what is currently configured in GeckoView.kt on
# a hard coded A-C release branch. If the branch is outdated then
# a new PR will be created to update the GV version and increment the
# A-C version.
