// This project is a dummy project; the JAR produced is not used.  The root
// project uses the set of inputs here to check if the omnijar needs to be
// rebuilt.  By listing them here as resource directories, IntelliJ labels each
// checked directly nicely.  Why list the directories here?  There's a mismatch
// between SourceDirectorySet and TaskInputs: the former is directory oriented,
// while the latter is more general.  That means its easy to convert this list
// into inputs for the root project, but not vice-versa.  Sadly this would mean
// that the root project evaluation depends on :omnijar, so we duplicate in the
// root project.
