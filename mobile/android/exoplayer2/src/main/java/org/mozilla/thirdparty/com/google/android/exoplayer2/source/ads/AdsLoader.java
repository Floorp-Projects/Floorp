/**
 * Interface for loaders of ads, which can be used with {@link AdsMediaSource}.
 *
 * <p>Ads loaders notify the {@link AdsMediaSource} about events via {@link EventListener}. In
 * particular, implementations must call {@link EventListener#onAdPlaybackState(AdPlaybackState)}
 * with a new copy of the current {@link AdPlaybackState} whenever further information about ads
 * becomes known (for example, when an ad media URI is available, or an ad has played to the end).
 *
 * <p>{@link #start(EventListener, AdViewProvider)} will be called when the ads media source first
 * initializes, at which point the loader can request ads. If the player enters the background,
 * {@link #stop()} will be called. Loaders should maintain any ad playback state in preparation for
 * a later call to {@link #start(EventListener, AdViewProvider)}. If an ad is playing when the
 * player is detached, update the ad playback state with the current playback position using {@link
 * AdPlaybackState#withAdResumePositionUs(long)}.
 *
 * <p>If {@link EventListener#onAdPlaybackState(AdPlaybackState)} has been called, the
 * implementation of {@link #start(EventListener, AdViewProvider)} should invoke the same listener
 * to provide the existing playback state to the new player.
