These are instructions for preparing a release branch for Firefox Android and starting the next Nightly development cycle.

## [Release Management] Creating a new Beta release branch

**This part is 100% covered by the Release Management team. The dev team should not perform these steps.**

1. Create a branch name with the format `releases_v[beta_version]` off of the `main` branch (for example, `releases_v109`) through the GitHub UI.
`[beta_version]` should follow the Firefox Beta release number. See [Firefox Release Calendar](https://whattrainisitnow.com/calendar/). The following below should be performed in this new beta release branch:
    - In [version.txt](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-android/blob/main/version.txt), update the version from `[beta_version].0a1` to `[beta_version].0b1`. Create a commit named `Set version to [beta_version].0b1` for this change. This change can either be directly committed to the `releases_v[beta_version]` branch or a pull request can be created against it and then merged.
        ```diff
        diff --git a/version.txt b/version.txt
        --- a/version.txt

        @@ -1 +1 @@
        -109.0a1
        +109.0b1
        ```
    - In [ApplicationServices.kt](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-android/blob/main/android-components/plugins/dependencies/src/main/java/ApplicationServices.kt):
      - Set `CHANNEL` to `ApplicationServicesChannel.RELEASE`
      - Set `VERSION` to `[major-version].0`

      ```
      - Create a commit named `Switch to Application Services Release`. (Note: application-services releases directly after the nightly cycle, there's no beta cycle).
    - In [Gecko.kt](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-android/blob/main/android-components/plugins/dependencies/src/main/java/Gecko.kt), set the `channel` to `GeckoChannel.BETA`. Create a commit named `Switch to GeckoView Beta` for this change. This change can either be directly committed to the `releases_v[beta_version]` branch or a pull request can be created against it and then merged. Once landed, it is expected that this change will temporarily break builds on the branch. Step #4 will fix them.

2. In `main` [version.txt](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-android/blob/main/version.txt), update the version from `[previous_nightly_version].0a1` to `[nightly_version].0a1`. Create a commit named `Set version to [nightly_version].0a1` for this change. This change can either be directly committed to the `main` branch or a pull request can be created against it and then merged.

    ```
3. Notify the dev team that they can start the new Nightly development cycle per the steps given in the next section ⬇️
4. The Github Action will automatically bump the GeckoView version once the new Beta build is created and uploaded to Maven, as shown in [#324](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-android/pull/324) for example.
5. Once all of the above commits have landed, create a new `Firefox Android (Android-Components, Fenix, Focus)` release in [Ship-It](https://shipit.mozilla-releng.net/) and continue with the release checklist per normal practice.

## [Dev team] Starting the next Nightly development cycle

**Please handle this part once Release Management gives you the go.**

Now that we made the Beta cut, we can remove all the unused strings marked moz:removedIn <= `[release_version subtract 1]`. `[release_version]` should follow the Firefox Release version. See [Firefox Release Calendar](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Calendar) for the current Release version. We will also want to bump the Android Component's [changelog.md](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-android/blob/main/docs/changelog.md) with the new Nightly development section.

0. Wait for greenlight coming from Release Management.
1. File a Bugzilla issue named "Start the Nightly `[nightly_version]` development cycle".
2. Search and remove all strings marked `moz:removedIn="[release_version subtract 1]"` across Fenix, Focus and Android Components. Please avoid removing strings in the localized `strings.xml` and limit changes only to `values/strings.xml`.
3. Add the next Nightly in development section in the [changelog.md](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-android/blob/main/docs/changelog.md).:
  - Add a new `[nightly_version].0 (In Development)` section for the next Nightly version with the next commit and milestone numbers.
  - Update the `[beta_version].0` section, update the links to `release_v[beta_version]` and specifying the correct commit ranges. This should equate to changing `/blob/main/` to `/blob/releases_v[beta_version]/`.

### [Dev Team] Renew telemetry

After the Beta cut, another task is to remove all soon to expire telemetry probes. What we're looking for is to create a list of telemetry that will expire in `[nightly_version add 1]`.  See [Firefox Release Calendar](https://whattrainisitnow.com/calendar/) for the current Release version.  There is a script that will help with finding these soon to expire telemetry.

1. Use the helper in tools folder `python3 data_renewal_generate.py [nightly_version add 1]` to detected and generate files that will help create the following files:
    - `[nightly_version add 1]`_expiry_list.csv
2. File an issue for removing expired telemetry to address the expired metrics. See [Bug 1881336](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1881336) for an example.
3. Remove the expired metrics.  See [example](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-android/pull/5700).

### [Dev Team] Add SERP Telemetry json dump

After the beta cut, another task is to add SERP telemetry json to the [search-telemetry-v2.json](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-android/blob/main/android-components/components/feature/search/src/main/assets/search/search_telemetry_v2.json)
The dump is to be fetched from the desktop telemetry dump located at [desktop-search-telemetry-v2.json](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/services/settings/dumps/main/search-telemetry-v2.json)
