# This file configures "evergreen" messages that are displayed via
# the Nimbus Messaging system.
#
# They are "evergreen" in that they apply to all users, and shipped with the app.
#
# This file is intended to grow new messages once messages have been tested via
# experiment, rolled out to everyone in the release, and are ready to be rolled out
# without the remote prompting from Experimenter.
#
# When adding new messages to this file, please add the experiment (and/or rollout) URLs used to
# validate them.
#
# Triggers, actions and styles are configured in messaging-fenix.fml.yaml.
