perf.startup:
  startup_type:
    type: labeled_counter
    description: |
      Indicates how the browser was started. The label is divided into two
      variables. `state` is how cached the browser is when started. `path` is
      what code path we are expected to take. Together, they create a combined
      label: `state_path`. For brevity, the specific states are documented in
      the [Fenix perf
      glossary](https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Performance/Fenix/Glossary).
      <br><br>
      This implementation is intended to be simple, not comprehensive. We list
      the implications below.

      <br><br>
      These ways of opening the app undesirably adds events to our primary
      buckets (non-`unknown` cases):
      <br>- App switcher cold/warm: `cold/warm_` + duplicates path from
      previous launch
      <br>- An Intent is sent internally that's uses `ACTION_MAIN` or
      `ACTION_VIEW` could be: `*_main/view` (unknown if this ever happens)
      <br>- A command-line launch uses `ACTION_MAIN` or `ACTION_VIEW` could be:
      `*_main/view`

      <br><br>
      These ways of opening the app undesirably do not add their events to our
      primary buckets:
      <br>- Close and reopen the app very quickly: no event is recorded.

      <br><br>
      These ways of opening the app don't affect our primary buckets:
      <br>- App switcher hot: `hot_unknown`
      <br>- PWA (all states): `unknown_unknown`
      <br>- Custom tab: `unknown_view`
      <br>- Cold start where a service or other non-activity starts the process
      (not manually tested) - this seems to happen if you have the homescreen
      widget: `unknown_*`
      <br>- Another activity is drawn before MainActivity or CustomTabActivity
      (e.g. widget voice
      search): `unknown_*`

      <br>
      In addition to the events above, the `unknown` state may be chosen when we
      were unable to determine a cause due to implementation details or the API
      was used incorrectly. We may be able to record the events listed above
      into different buckets but we kept the implementation simple for now.
      <br><br>
      N.B.: for implementation simplicity, we duplicate the logic in app that
      determines `path` so it's not perfectly accurate. In one way, we record we
      is intended to happen rather than what actually happened (e.g. the user
      may click a link so we record VIEW but the app does a MAIN by going to the
      homescreen because the link was invalid).
