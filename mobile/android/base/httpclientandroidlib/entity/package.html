Representations for HTTP message entities.

An {@link org.apache.http.HttpEntity entity} is the optional content of a
{@link org.apache.http.HttpMessage message}.
This package provides a basic selection of entity implementations
that can obtain content from
{@link org.apache.http.entity.ByteArrayEntity byte array},
{@link org.apache.http.entity.StringEntity string},
{@link org.apache.http.entity.FileEntity file}, or through an arbitrary
{@link org.apache.http.entity.InputStreamEntity input stream}.
If a message is received from an open connection, usually it is
represented by
{@link org.apache.http.entity.BasicHttpEntity streamed} entity.
Entity implementations can be
{@link org.apache.http.entity.HttpEntityWrapper wrapped},
for example to
{@link org.apache.http.entity.BufferedHttpEntity buffer}
the content in memory.
