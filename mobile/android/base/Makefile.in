# [Comment 1/3] We don't have correct dependencies for strings.xml at
# this point, so we always recursively invoke the submake to check the
# dependencies.  Sigh.  And, with multilocale builds, there will be
# multiple strings.xml files, and we need to rebuild gecko.ap_ if any
# of them change.  But!  mobile/android/base/locales does not have
# enough information to actually build res/values/strings.xml during a
# language repack.  So rather than adding rules into the main
# makefile, and trying to work around the lack of information, we
# force a rebuild of gecko.ap_ during packaging.  See below.

# Since the sub-Make is forced, it doesn't matter that we touch the
# target file before the command.  If in the future we stop forcing
# the sub-Make, touching the target file first is better, because the
# sub-Make outputs will be fresher than the target, and not require
# rebuilding.  This is all safe because Make removes the target file
# if any recipe command fails. It is crucial that the sub-Make touch
# the target files (those depending on .locales.deps) only when there
# contents have changed; otherwise, this will force rebuild them as
# part of every build.

# recipe: defining no recipe at all causes Make to treat the target
# differently, in a way that defeats our dependencies.
