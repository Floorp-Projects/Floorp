<!-- Note: After removing all MDPI assets, the reader icons were being resolved
           incorrectly for MDPI-V11 devices because of the way we use dummy
           resources to cater for API 9 builds.  To fix we renamed the HDPI-V11
           reader resources and point to them in the HDPI-V11 and MDPI-V11
           drawable folders.  See Bug 1179758 for more info. -->
