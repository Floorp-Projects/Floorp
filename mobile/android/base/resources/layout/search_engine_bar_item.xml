<!-- TwoWayView doesn't let us set the margin around items (except as
     gecko:itemMargin, but that doesn't increase the hit area) so we
     have to surround the main View by a ViewGroup to create a pressable margin.

     Note: the layout_height values are shared with the parent
     View (browser_search at the time of this writing).

     The actual width of the FrameLayout is calculated at runtime by the
     SearchEngineBar class to spread the icons across the device's width. -->
