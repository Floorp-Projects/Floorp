      <h1>"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" by L. Frank Baum</h1>
      <p>
        The little girl, seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes, grew
        angry, and said to the Witch, “Give me back my shoe!”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I will not,” retorted the Witch, “for it is now my shoe, and not
        yours.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “You are a wicked creature!” cried Dorothy. “You have no right to take
        my shoe from me.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I shall keep it, just the same,” said the Witch, laughing at her, “and
        someday I shall get the other one from you, too.”
      </p>
      <p>
        This made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water
        that stood near and dashed it over the Witch, wetting her from head to
        foot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear, and then, as Dorothy
        looked at her in wonder, the Witch began to shrink and fall away.
      </p>
      <p>
        “See what you have done!” she screamed. “In a minute I shall melt away.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I’m very sorry, indeed,” said Dorothy, who was truly frightened to see
        the Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Didn’t you know water would be the end of me?” asked the Witch, in a
        wailing, despairing voice.
      </p>
      <p>“Of course not,” answered Dorothy. “How should I?”</p>
