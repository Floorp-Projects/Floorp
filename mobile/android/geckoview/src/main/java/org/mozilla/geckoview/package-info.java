/**
 * This package contains the public interfaces for the library.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.mozilla.geckoview.GeckoRuntime} is the entry point for starting and initializing
 *       Gecko. You can use this to preload Gecko before you need to load a page or to configure
 *       features such as crash reporting.
 *   <li>{@link org.mozilla.geckoview.GeckoSession} is where most interesting work happens, such as
 *       loading pages. It relies on {@link org.mozilla.geckoview.GeckoRuntime} to talk to Gecko.
 *   <li>{@link org.mozilla.geckoview.GeckoView} is the embeddable {@link android.view.View}. This
 *       is the most common way of getting a {@link org.mozilla.geckoview.GeckoSession} onto the
 *       screen.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Permissions</strong>
 *
 * <p>This library does not request any dangerous permissions in the manifest, though it's possible
 * that some web features may require them. For instance, WebRTC video calls would need the {@link
 * android.Manifest.permission#CAMERA} and {@link android.Manifest.permission#RECORD_AUDIO}
 * permissions. Declaring these are at the application's discretion. If you want full web
 * functionality, the following permissions should be declared:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link android.Manifest.permission#ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION}
 *   <li>{@link android.Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION}
 *   <li>{@link android.Manifest.permission#READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE}
 *   <li>{@link android.Manifest.permission#WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE}
 *   <li>{@link android.Manifest.permission#CAMERA}
 *   <li>{@link android.Manifest.permission#RECORD_AUDIO}
 * </ul>
 *
 * For a detailed change log of the API see: <a href="./doc-files/CHANGELOG"
 * target="_blank">CHANGELOG</a>.
