js/semantics contains experimental code used to generate LR(1) and LALR(1)
grammars for JavaScript as well as compile and check formal semantics for
JavaScript.  The semantics can be executed directly or printed into either
HTML or Microsoft Word RTF formats.

This code is written in standard Common Lisp.  It's been used under Macintosh
Common Lisp 4.0, but should also work under other Common Lisp implementations.
