// LUL: A Lightweight Unwind Library.
// This file provides the end-user (external) interface for LUL.

// Some comments about naming in the implementation.  These are safe
// to ignore if you are merely using LUL, but are important if you
// hack on its internals.
//
// Debuginfo readers in general have tended to use the word "address"
// to mean several different things.  This sometimes makes them
// difficult to understand and maintain.  LUL tries hard to avoid
// using the word "address" and instead uses the following more
// precise terms:
//
// * SVMA ("Stated Virtual Memory Address"): this is an address of a
//   symbol (etc) as it is stated in the symbol table, or other
//   metadata, of an object.  Such values are typically small and
//   start from zero or thereabouts, unless the object has been
//   prelinked.
//
// * AVMA ("Actual Virtual Memory Address"): this is the address of a
//   symbol (etc) in a running process, that is, once the associated
//   object has been mapped into a process.  Such values are typically
//   much larger than SVMAs, since objects can get mapped arbitrarily
//   far along the address space.
//
// * "Bias": the difference between AVMA and SVMA for a given symbol
//   (specifically, AVMA - SVMA).  The bias is always an integral
//   number of pages.  Once we know the bias for a given object's
//   text section (for example), we can compute the AVMAs of all of
//   its text symbols by adding the bias to their SVMAs.
//
// * "Image address": typically, to read debuginfo from an object we
//   will temporarily mmap in the file so as to read symbol tables
//   etc.  Addresses in this temporary mapping are called "Image
//   addresses".  Note that the temporary mapping is entirely
//   unrelated to the mappings of the file that the dynamic linker
//   must perform merely in order to get the program to run.  Hence
//   image addresses are unrelated to either SVMAs or AVMAs.

// The core unwinder library class.  Just one of these is needed, and
// it can be shared by multiple unwinder threads.
//
// The library operates in one of two modes.
//
// * Admin mode.  The library is this state after creation.  In Admin
//   mode, no unwinding may be performed.  It is however allowable to
//   perform administrative tasks -- primarily, loading of unwind info
//   -- in this mode.  In particular, it is safe for the library to
//   perform dynamic memory allocation in this mode.  Safe in the
//   sense that there is no risk of deadlock against unwinding threads
//   that might -- because of where they have been sampled -- hold the
//   system's malloc lock.
//
// * Unwind mode.  In this mode, calls to ::Unwind may be made, but
//   nothing else.  ::Unwind guarantees not to make any dynamic memory
//   requests, so as to guarantee that the calling thread won't
//   deadlock in the case where it already holds the system's malloc lock.
//
// The library is created in Admin mode.  After debuginfo is loaded,
// the caller must switch it into Unwind mode by calling
// ::EnableUnwinding.  There is no way to switch it back to Admin mode
// after that.  To safely switch back to Admin mode would require the
// caller (or other external agent) to guarantee that there are no
// pending ::Unwind calls.
