# Profiling categories
# ====================
# This file defines all profiling categories with their sub-categories. It is
# parsed by generate_profiling_categories.py at build time to create
# ProfilingCategoryList.h and profiling_categories.rs files.
#
# Profiling sub-categories are applied to each sampled stack to describe the
# type of workload that the CPU is busy with. Only one sub-category can be
# assigned so be mindful that these are non-overlapping. The active category is
# set by pushing a label to the profiling stack, or by the unwinder in cases
# such as JITs. A profile sample in arbitrary C++/Rust will typically be
# categorized based on the top of the label stack.
#
# Each category consists of a name and a set of attributes that are described below:
#
# name [required]
# ====
# Name of the profiling category. This will be used in the C++ enum fields (not
# by Rust).
#
# label [required]
# =====
# Label of the profiling category. This a more human readable string for the
# category. Label will be displayed in the Firefox Profiler front-end. But also
# this will be used as a Rust enum field (with non-alphanumeric characters
# removed) because it's more idiomatic for Rust enums than name fields (which
# are snake cased fields with all caps, which is not idiomatic to rust enum
# field).
#
# color [required]
# =====
# Color that this category will show up as in the Firefox Profiler front-end.
# The list of available color names for categories is:
# - transparent
# - blue
# - green
# - grey
# - lightblue
# - magenta
# - orange
# - purple
# - yellow
#
# subcategories [required]
# =============
# A list of sub-categories that belong to this category.
# There must be at least one sub-category for each category and there must be at
# least one category with the same name as the category to indicate the default
# sub-category. Each sub-category must have name and label attributes.
#
# name attribute should either be the same as the category (for default
# sub-category) or should start with parent category name + underscore
# (e.g. JS_Parsing).
#
# label attribute has the same purpose as parent category label attribute.
#
# For example:
# - name: JS
#   subcategories:
#     - name: JS
#       label: Other
#     - name: JS_Parsing
#       label: Parsing
#
# Note that the first sub-category has the same name with the category. This is
# the default sub-category. Also note the other sub-categories starting with the
# category name + underscore.
