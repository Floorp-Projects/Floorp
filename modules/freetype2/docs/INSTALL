There are  several ways  to build the  FreeType library,  depending on
your system and the level of  customization you need.  Here is a short
overview of the documentation available:


I. Prerequisites and dependencies
=================================

  FreeType is a low level C library  that only depends on the standard
  C library with very few platform-dependent optimizations utilized at
  build time.  Any  C99-compliant compiler  should be able  to compile
  FreeType.  System libraries,  such as  zlib,  Gzip,  bzip2,  Brotli,
  and libpng,  might  be  used  to handle  compressed fonts  or decode
  embedded PNG glyphs.

  FreeType  auto-configuration scripts  should be  able to detect  the
  prerequisites if the necessary headers are available  at the default
  locations.  Otherwise,  modify  `include/freetype/config/ftoption.h`
  to control how the FreeType library gets built.  Normally, you don't
  need to change anything.

  Applications have very limited control over FreeType's behaviour  at
  run-time;  look at the documentation of function `FT_Property_Set`.


II. Normal installation and upgrades
====================================

  1. Unix and Unix-like systems

    This also includes MacOS, Cygwin, MinGW + MSYS, Mingw-w64 + MSYS2,
    and possibly other, similar environments.

    Please read `INSTALL.UNIX` to install or upgrade FreeType  2 on  a
    Unix system.   Note  that  you  *need*  GNU  Make   for  automatic
    compilation,  since other make tools won't work (this includes BSD
    Make).

    GNU Make VERSION 3.81 OR NEWER IS NEEDED!


  2. Other systems using GNU Make

    On some  non-Unix platforms, it  is possible to build  the library
    using only  the GNU Make utility.   Note that *NO OTHER  MAKE TOOL
    WILL  WORK*[1]!   This  methods   supports  several  compilers  on
    Windows, OS/2, and BeOS,  including MinGW* (without MSYS*), Visual
    C++, Borland C++, and more.

    Instructions are provided in the file `INSTALL.GNU`.


  3. Other build tools and platforms.

    A few other tools  can be used  to build FreeType.  You  can  find
    the  corresponding instruction files  in  the FreeType root folder
    or the builds/ sub-folder.

      CMake   :: see `CMakeLists.txt` for more information
      Meson   :: see `meson.build` for more information
      MSBuild :: see `builds/windows/vc2010/freetype.vcxproj`
      MMS     :: see `vms_make.com` and `docs/INSTALL.VMS`


  4. With an IDE Project File (e.g., for Visual Studio or CodeWarrior)

    We provide a  small number of 'project files'  for various IDEs to
    automatically build  the library as  well.  Note that  these files
    are not actively supported by FreeType developers,  they can break
    or become obsolete.

    To find them, have a  look at the content of the `builds/<system>`
    directory, where <system> stands for your OS or environment.


  5. From you own IDE, or own Makefiles

    If  you  want  to  create   your  own  project  file,  follow  the
    instructions   given  in  the   `INSTALL.ANY`  document   of  this
    directory.


III. Custom builds of the library
=================================

  Customizing the compilation  of FreeType is easy, and  allows you to
  select only the components of  the font engine that you really need.
  For more details read the file `CUSTOMIZE`.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

[1] make++, a make tool written in Perl, has sufficient support of GNU
    make extensions to build FreeType.  See

      https://makepp.sourceforge.net

    for more information;  you need version 2.0 or newer, and you must
    pass option `--norc-substitution`.
