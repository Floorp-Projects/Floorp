   *
   * STATUS_LOAD_PARTIAL: Used internally by imgRequest to
   * flag that a request is being cancelled as a result of
   * a failure of a proxy holder and not an internal failure.
   * At least I think that's what it does. Regardless, there's
   * no reason for this flag to be public, and it should either
   * go away or become a private state flag within imgRequest.
   * Don't rely on it.
