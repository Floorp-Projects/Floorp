/**
 * nsIZipWriter
 *
 * An interface for a zip archiver that can be used from script.
 *
 * The interface supports both a synchronous method of archiving data and a
 * queueing system to allow operations to be prepared then run in sequence
 * with notification after completion.
 *
 * Operations added to the queue do not get performed until performQueue is
 * called at which point they will be performed in the order that they were
 * added to the queue.
 *
 * Operations performed on the queue will throw any errors out to the
 * observer.
 *
 * An attempt to perform a synchronous operation while the background queue
 * is in progress will throw NS_ERROR_IN_PROGRESS.
 *
 * Entry names should use /'s as path separators and should not start with
 * a /.
 *
 * It is not generally necessary to add directory entries in order to add file
 * entries within them, however it is possible that some zip programs may
 * experience problems what that.
