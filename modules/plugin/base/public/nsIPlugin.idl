 * The nsIPlugin interface is the minimum interface plugin developers need to

 *
 * The old NPP_New plugin operation is now subsumed by two operations:
 *
 * CreateInstance -- called once, after the plugin instance is created. This 
 * method is used to initialize the new plugin instance (although the actual
 * plugin instance object will be created by the plugin manager).
 *
 * nsIPluginInstance::Start -- called when the plugin instance is to be
 * started. This happens in two circumstances: (1) after the plugin instance
 * is first initialized, and (2) after a plugin instance is returned to
 * (e.g. by going back in the window history) after previously being stopped
 * by the Stop method.
