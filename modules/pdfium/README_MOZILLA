The source in this directory was copied from upstream by running the
update.sh script from modules/pdfium. Any changes that we make to our
copy of the upstream code should be made by that script (e.g. by applying
patch files after the copy step).

The upstream repository is https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium
