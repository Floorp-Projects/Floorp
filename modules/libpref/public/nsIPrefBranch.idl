   *              the |root| of the aSubject branch.
   *
   * aSubject.get*Pref(aData) will get the new value of the modified
   * preference. For example, if your observer is registered with
   * addObserver("bar.", ...) on a branch with root "foo.", modifying
   * the preference "foo.bar.baz" will trigger the observer, and aData
   * parameter will be "bar.baz".
   *
   * @param aDomain   The preference on which to listen for changes. This can
   *                  be the name of an entire branch to observe.
   *                  e.g. Holding the "root" prefbranch and calling
   *                  addObserver("foo.bar.", ...) will observe changes to
   *                  foo.bar.baz and foo.bar.bzip
   * @param aObserver The object to be notified if the preference changes.
   * @param aHoldWeak true  Hold a weak reference to |aObserver|. The object
   *                        must implement the nsISupportsWeakReference
   *                        interface or this will fail.
   *                  false Hold a strong reference to |aObserver|.
   *
   * @note
   * Registering as a preference observer can open an object to potential
   * cyclical references which will cause memory leaks. These cycles generally
   * occur because an object both registers itself as an observer (causing the
   * branch to hold a reference to the observer) and holds a reference to the
   * branch object for the purpose of getting/setting preference values. There
   * are 3 approaches which have been implemented in an attempt to avoid these
   * situations.
   * 1) The nsPrefBranch object supports nsISupportsWeakReference. Any consumer
   *    may hold a weak reference to it instead of a strong one.
   * 2) The nsPrefBranch object listens for xpcom-shutdown and frees all of the
   *    objects currently in its observer list. This ensures that long lived
   *    objects (services for example) will be freed correctly.
   * 3) The observer can request to be held as a weak reference when it is
   *    registered. This insures that shorter lived objects (say one tied to an
   *    open window) will not fall into the cyclical reference trap.
   *
   * @note
   * The list of registered observers may be changed during the dispatch of
   * nsPref:changed notification. However, the observers are not guaranteed
   * to be notified in any particular order, so you can't be sure whether the
   * added/removed observer will be called during the notification when it
   * is added/removed.
   *
   * @note
   * It is possible to change preferences during the notification.
   *
   * @note
   * It is not safe to change observers during this callback in Gecko 
   * releases before 1.9. If you want a safe way to remove a pref observer,
   * please use an nsITimer.
