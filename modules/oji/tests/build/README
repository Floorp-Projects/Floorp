======================
I. To build OJI API test:
======================

 1. set MOZILLA_HOME (top of Mozilla's tree) and JAVAHOME variables
 2. goto build directory and say
	nmake -f Makefile.win

=====================
II. To run OJI API tests:
=====================

 1. Copy all *.dll files from build/bin directory to Mozilla's bin
    directory
 2. Add the following string into your morProfile/prefs.js file
 	user_pref("security.checkxpconnect", false);	
 5. Update Path variable to include 
	$MOZILLA_HOME/dist/win32_d.obj/bin and
	$MOZILLA_HOME/dist/win32_d.obj/bin/components
 6. In Mozilla's bin directory say 
	regxpcom.exe ojiapitl.dll
    If this step fails for some reason see section III(1).

A. Quick mode (all test cases in one Mozilla session):
-------------------------------------------------
 7. Copy OJITest.lst from build directory to Mozilla's 
    bin directory
 8. in Mozilla's bin directory say
	viewer file:/test.html
 9. Click "Start" button in the loaded document


B. Slow mode (new Mozilla session for each test case):
------------------------------------------------------
 7. Goto script directory and set correct parameters in the first few 
    lines of autorun.pl file.
 8. Run perl script
	perl autorun.pl
 9 See results of execution in the log directory.


Note: If you plan to run JNIEnv tests add classes/test.jar (or simply classes
directory) into your CLASSPATH. Also you may need to add this path 
into your Java Policy file with java.security.AllPermission permission
(otherwise it's impossible to load native libraries from these classes).


====================
III. Known problems:
====================
 1. In the last version of Mozilla regxpcom fails to registry 
   anything. So do the following:
	a. Put all dll's into Mozilla's bin/components (instead of bin directory) directory
	b. Delete component.reg file in Mozilla's bin directory

 2. Buildin OJI tests fails because linker can't find destructor of
    nsCOMPtr_base class (~nsCOMPtr_base). I had no time to evalute 
    this problem - so simply comment the followin line in the 
    dist/include/nsCOMPtr.h file:
	#define NSCAP_FEATURE_FACTOR_DESTRUCTOR
	
 3. While running tests in the 'slow' mode (using autorun.pl) no logs
    from STDOUT and STDERR are stored in log files if MOZILLA_EXCUTABLE
    is set to viewer.exe.

==========================
I. To build OJI API test:
==========================

 1. set MOZILLA_HOME (top of Mozilla's tree) and JAVAHOME variables
 2. goto build directory and say
	gmake

==========================
II. To run OJI API tests:
==========================

 1. Copy all *.so files from build/bin directory to Mozilla's bin
    directory
 2. Copy test.html,loader.html to a location on your WebServer.
    Change test.html to reflect correct URL path.
 3. set environment variable TEST_URL to point to URL path where 
    test.html is located.
 4. Add the following string into your mozProfile/prefs.js file
 	user_pref("security.checkxpconnect", false);	
 5. Update Path variable to include 
	$MOZILLA_HOME/dist/win32_d.obj/bin and
	$MOZILLA_HOME/dist/win32_d.obj/bin/components
 6. In Mozilla's bin directory say 
	regxpcom libojiapitl.so
    If this step fails for some reason see section III(1).

A. Quick mode (all test cases in one Mozilla session):
------------------------------------------------------
 7. Copy OJITest.lst from build directory to Mozilla's 
    bin directory

B. Slow mode (new Mozilla session for each test case):
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 7. Goto script directory and set correct parameters in the first few 
    lines of autorun.pl file.
        MOZILLA_EXECUTABLE -> Mozilla binary name
        ADDITIONAL_PARAMETERS -> Enter Profile you want to use

 8. Run perl script
	perl autorun.pl
 9 See results of execution in the log directory.


Note: If you plan to run JNIEnv tests add classes/test.jar into your CLASSPATH
