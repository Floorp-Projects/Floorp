Frequently Asked Questions ( for Build and Execution)

Build Problems
--------------
NOTE: These API tests are build using Gnu COmpiler gcc.
      Always ensure that you compile Tests in same mode as Mozilla is compiled.
      (Debug/Non-debug).

Solaris/Linux:
==============

1) On invoking gmake I get a message
    WARNING: MOZILLA_HOME variable is incorrect !  

  MOZILLA_HOME dir. should point to absolute Path of mozilla dir. under
  which all sources are located (e.g. /opt/mozilla).


2) On invoking gmake I get an error
    /usr/ucb/cc:  language optional software package not installed
    make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `link'

  This is because it could not find a valid GNU compiler 'gcc' in your PATH.
  Update your PATH variable to point a valid location for 'gcc'
  Also set the environment variable CC to gcc
  (if in C-shell then,  setenv CC gcc).


3) On invoking gmake I get an error, even though I have 'gcc' in my PATH.
   Error message displayed is
    /usr/ucb/cc:  language optional software package not installed
    make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `link'

   
  Set environment variable CC to gcc
  (if in C-shell then,  setenv CC gcc).


4) On invoking gmake I get an error, 
    sh: javac: not found

  This is because you do not have 'javac' in your PATH
  Add ${JDKHOME}/bin into your PATH environment variable


5) On invoking gmake I get an error, 
    undefined versioned symbol not found.  NSGetModule@@Exported

  This is the famous problem of Mozilla being compiled in DEBUG mode
  and OJI API tests in non-debug mode.
  Ensure that both are the same (See mozilla.org build req. for setting
  Debug/Non-debug mode).


Win32:
======

5) On invoking nmake I get an error
    OJITestLoader.h: fatal error: Cannot open include file 'nsISupports.h'
   no such file or directory

  This is because MOZILLA_HOME is not set
  MOZILLA_HOME dir. should point to absolute Path of mozilla dir. under
  which all sources are located (e.g. /opt/mozilla).


6) On invoking nmake I get an error
   LINK: fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file nspr4.lib

  This is because MOZILLA_HOME is not set
  MOZILLA_HOME dir. should point to absolute Path of mozilla dir. under
  which all sources are located (e.g. /opt/mozilla).


7) On invoking nmake I get an error
    .... Cannot open include file prtypes.h

  This usually happens if you have built MOZILLA in non-debug mode and are
  trying to build the tests in debug mode.
  Check you environment. You will have MOZ_DEBUG set
  Unsetting it will resolve the problem
  ( set MOZ_DEBUG= )


8) On invoking nmake I get an error (even after I have set MOZILLA_HOME)
   LINK: fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file nspr4.lib

  This usually happens if you have built MOZILLA in non-debug mode and are
  trying to build the tests in debug mode.
  Check you environment. You will have MOZ_DEBUG set
  Unsetting it will resolve the problem
  ( set MOZ_DEBUG= )


9) On invoking nmake I get an error 
      NMAKE: fatal error ..: javac : return code...

  This is because you do not have 'javac' in your PATH
  Add ${JDKHOME}/bin into your PATH environment variable

Execution Problems
------------------
NOTE: These API tests are build using Gnu Compiler gcc.

10)  On execution autorun.pl I get errors
       syntax error in file autorun.pl at line 36, next 2 tokens "use POSIX"
       syntax error in file autorun.pl at line 72, next 2 tokens "cwd("
       syntax error in file autorun.pl at line 94, next 2 tokens "\usage("
       Execution of autorun.pl aborted due to compilation errors.
 

    This is becuase you are using an older version of Perl
    Use Perl version >= 5 and add the same to PATH environment variable


11) On execution of autorun.pl I get message
        MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME is not set. Please set it and rerun this script....

   The environment variable MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME is not set
   It should point to absolute dir. where mozilla-bin is located
   Set MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME <mozilla dir>/dist/bin


12) How can I invoke a specific test

   In the script directory, there is a file OJITestsList.lst. This file 
   contains list of all tests. To execute any particular one use '-t' 
   option.
    perl autorun.pl -t JNIEnv_AllocObject_2 
   This command will execute on this particular test.


13) On executing autorun.pl, browser always invokes "Profile Window". Is there
    any way to supress this box.

   In autorun.pl, search of ADDITIONAL_PARAMETERS. It is set to "-P default"
   Change it to reflect your Profile name  (-P myProfile)


14) On executing autorun.pl, browser does not load the test.html.

   This is because it is not able tofind test.html.
   There are 2 ways of setting. One is to set environment variable TEST_URL
   to point to dir. which contains test.html
   (In C-Shell setenv TEST_URL <mozilla dir>/modules/oji/tests/script )

   or open autorun.pl and change DEFAULT_TEST_URL to indicate your path


15) On executing autorun.pl, browser in invoked, but before test.html is loaded
    it exits. 

   This is due to the DELAY_FACTOR set in the script.
   On slower machine, you may want to increase the  value of this variable.
   Open autorun.pl, search for DELAY_FACTOR. change the value to a 
   higher number (currently it is set to 50)
    
16) On executin autorun.pl, it immedialtely exits. On checking the log file
    it says  fatal: libgkggfx.so: open failed: No such file or directory

    This is because <MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME> is not set in LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and
    so is not able to find the above mentioned library.
    Setting it, will resolve the problem.
    (setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH <MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME>:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH})


17) On executing autorun.pl, browser in invoked, an test.html is loaded, but
    it does not prompt me for a "Internet Security" Dialog box.

   There can be many factors for this
    * Cross-check the 'test.html'. It should have the following line
       netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege("UniversalXPConnect")

    * Check <home dir>/.mozilla/default/prefs.js (on Solaris/Linux) or
            c:/Program Files/Mozilla/Users50/Default/prefs.js (on Win32)
      file. If it has the follwing entries
          user_pref("capability.principal.codebase.p0.granted", "UniversalXPConnect");
          user_pref("capability.principal.codebase.p0.id", "file://");

      then, you have already given access permissions. Remove these entries
      and try execution again.

    * Check the above prefs.js if it has entry 
          user_pref("capability.principal.codebase.p0.denied", "UniversalXPConnect");
      
      then you have Denied permissions to execute it. Remove that entry and 
      re-try execution.


18) On executin autorun.pl, it loads test.html and  exits after sometime.
    However the result is FAILED. On checking the log file it indicates
       ld.so.1: /opt/mozilla/dist/bin/mozilla-bin: fatal: liboji.so: open 
        failed: No such file or directory

   This is because <MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME>/components dir. is not set in 
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and so is not able to find the above mentioned library.
   Setting it, will resolve the problem.
   (setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH <MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME>/components:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH})


19) Where can I find list of All Test Cases?
 
   In 'script' dir. there is a file 'OJITestsList.lst'. This file lists
   out all Test Cases.


20) Is there a list of Test Cases that have to PASS for a particular platform
   
   In 'script' directory there is a file OJIValidTestsList.lst. This is
   list of Test cases which have to PASS for a particular platform.


21) What should I do to invoke 'should PASS' Tests for a particular platform

   In 'script' dir. rename 'OJITestsList.lst' to 'OJITestsList.lst.orig'.
   Copy OJIValidTestsList.lst to OJITestsList.lst
   And then invoke autorun.pl


22) Is Macintosh platform supported.

   Currently tests are not supported for Macintosh platform.
    

23) What platforms are supported.
    
   Win32 (NT/98/95/2000)  and Solaris 2.7/2.8 (intel/sparc)


24) On Win32 platforms, after execution  all the Tests, my "Start Menu bar"
    is filled with tons of small "Duke' icons. How can I get rid of it?

   This  is one of the bugs in Java Plugin. After exiting browser, the Duke 
   icon is still displayed in the rightmost corner of Start Bar. If we move
   mouse over the icon, it disappears.

   To avoid this whole bunch of icons, after you invoke autorun.pl, just
   place the mouse at the righmost corner on the Duke icon.


25) Where are the  result files stored.
    
   In 'script/log' directory you will find a bunch of log files.
   BWTest.txt file lists out PASS/FAIL results.
   BWTest.html is the above file in HTML format.
   BWTestRun.log is the history of tests you ran.


26) What other options are supported by autorun.pl
 
    Invoke perl autorun.pl -help
    It will list out all options


27) After running tests, I went ahead and remove the libraries from components 
    directory (libojapi*.so)
    Now when I invoke Mozilla, it complains of not finding those libraries.
    How can I remove this dependency.

    In you MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME dir. there is a file 'component.reg'.
    Delete this file and invoke mozilla again.


28) All my JNI Tests seem to be failing even after I have granted permissions
    to XPConnect call (thru' Internet Security Box).

   All JNI tests has dependency on Java class files in 'build/classes' dir.
   If the JVM cannot find theses classes, all tests will fail.
   Go to <JDKHOME>/jre/bin directory. Invoke the 'ControlPanel' executable.
   (On Win32 platforms click on  Start->Settings->Control Panel->Duke icon)
   
   In the Java RunTime Parameters Text Field, add the follwing entry
   -Xbootclasspath/a:<mozilla dir>/modules/oji/tests/build/classes
   
   where <mozilla dir> is absolute path  to mozilla dir.
   ( e.g:  -Xbootclasspath/a:c:\mozilla\modules\oji\tests\build\classes ) 

   Press 'Apply'
   Go to to your <home dir>/.java
   There should be a 'properties130_01' file with the entry
    javaplugin.jre.params=-Xbootclasspath/a\:c\:\\mozilla\\modules\oji\\tests\\build\\classes
   Now retry, executing the Tests .



29) On Win98, when I run thru' the tests, and if Mozilla crashes, it invokes
    a VC++ debug window, which stays on top. Sometimes I see a lot of 
    such windows.  How can I ge rid of them? (I do not see the same on NT)
      

   This is a bug we have encuntered. 
   In src/Killer dir. there is a file killer.cpp.win98.
   DO the following.
     copy killer.cpp to killer.cpp.win32
     copy killer.cpp.win98 to killer.cpp
     then execute command
     cl killer.cpp /link user32.lib

   This will generate a new killer.exe .
     copy killer.exe to 'script' dir.
   Now re-run the Tests. This problem should be resolved.


30) After I run a particular test, and if tests is flagged of as FAILED
    how do I know what went wrong.

  In 'script/log' dir. for Each Test case there is a equivalent log created
  named <testcase>_<pid>.log

  To find out which is the most recent log, check by time stamp
    (ls -lt <testcase>_*.log )
  Open the recent one, and it will tell you what went wrong


32) If I encounter any other problems while running these tests, whom can I 
    contact?

   Send feedback to oji@eng.sun.com. Someone will get in touch with you.
