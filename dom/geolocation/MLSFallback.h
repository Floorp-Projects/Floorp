/*
 This class wraps the NetworkGeolocationProvider in a delayed startup.
 It is for providing a fallback to MLS when:
 1) using another provider as the primary provider, and
 2) that primary provider may fail to return a result (i.e. the error returned
 is indeterminate, or no error callback occurs)

 The intent is that the primary provider is started, then MLSFallback
 is started with sufficient delay that the primary provider will respond first
 if successful (in the majority of cases).

 MLS has an average response of 3s, so with the 2s default delay, a response can
 be expected in 5s.

 Telemetry is recommended to monitor that the primary provider is responding
 first when expected to do so.
