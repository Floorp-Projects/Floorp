 * The goal of this test is to prove that orphaned files are cleaned up during
 * origin initialization. A file is orphaned when there's a file with zero size
 * in the $dbName.files/journals directory and the file table in the database
 * contains no records for given id. A file can become orphaned when we didn't
 * have a chance to remove the file from disk during shutdown or the app just
 * crashed.
