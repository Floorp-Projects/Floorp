  // - parent->child: This happens after a Close(). The child wants to inform

  //                  that the channel can be interrupted.
  // - child->parent: before any operation, the child could start a migration
  //                  from the current thread to a dedicated DOM-File one. The
  //                  reason why a __delete__ is sent from child to parent is
  //                  because it doesn't require any additional runnables.
