         <contents>
            <para>
For estimated tax payments for tax years beginning in 1999, the safe harbor for higher income individuals (other than farmers and fishermen) has been modified. If your 1998 adjusted gross income was more than $150,000 ($75,000 if you aremarried filing a separate return for 1999), you will have to pay the smaller of 90% of your expected tax for 1999 or 105% (up from 100%) of the tax shown on your 1998 return (provided your 1998 return covered all 12 months) to avoid an estimated tax penalty.
