/**
 * This interface represents a content sink for generic XML files.
 * The goal of this sink is to deal with XML documents that do not
 * have pre-built semantics, though it may also be implemented for
 * cases in which semantics are hard-wired.
 *
 * The expectation is that the parser has already performed
 * well-formedness and validity checking.
 *
 * XXX The expectation is that entity expansion will be done by the sink
 * itself. This would require, however, that the sink has the ability
 * to query the parser for entity replacement text.
 *
 * XXX This interface does not contain a mechanism for the sink to
 * get specific schema/DTD information from the parser. This information
 * may be necessary for entity expansion. It is also necessary for
 * building the DOM portions that relate to the schema.
 *
 * XXX This interface does not deal with the presence of an external
 * subset. It seems possible that this could be dealt with completely
 * at the parser level.
