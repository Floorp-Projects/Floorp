== jQuery ChangeLog ==

== 1.2.2 ==

* show is now element aware (uses default display type instead of just forcing block)
* New special events api: jQuery.events.special
* ready is now a real event and can be bound, unbound and triggered.
* mouseenter and mouseleave now work on all supported browsers
* The hover helper method now uses the mouseenter and mouseleave events
* New offset test suite test/offset.html (requires your pop-up blocker to be disabled)
* Refactored the width and height methods (fixes lots of bugs)
* Fixed event memory leaks in IE (html, remove, empty also no longer leak memory)
* Fixed window/document width/height values
* Fixed event.pageX and event.pageY in IE

== 1.2 ==

=== 1.1.3 ===
* Always create an ActiveXObject when it is available instead of the XMLHttpRequest, even in IE7
* Removed XMLHttpRequest shadowing, may break code that relies on existence of that function for browser checking
* ...

=== 1.1.2 ===

* Event handlers (like element.onclick) are now removed when no more functions are bound to the event.
* Fixed DOM Manipulations for form elements.
* Fixed jQuery.isFunction to return false on nodes.
* Fixed jQuery.className.has, escaping regex characters in className (for metadata)
* Fixed an issue in IE where an event on a cloned element is fired during a .clone() inside of an event handler.
* Fixed IE ID selectors selecting by the name attribute.
* Change: Events are now internally stored in elem.$events rather than elem.events (due to a nasty bug relating to DOM 0 expandos).
* .attr('href') is now consistent in all browsers.
* @href is now consistent in all browsers.
* Fixed the slideDown flickering bug.
* Having a \r endline in $("...") caused a never-ending loop.
* Fixed IE6 AJAX memory leak
* Fixed bug in pushStack, reporting an element at [0] in a jQuery object with length 0

=== 1.1.1 ===

* Setting the numerical value of a css property failed, for example: .css("opacity",0.5) (also occurred with zIndex, fontWeight)
* Calling $(..., jqobj) with a context of a jQuery object failed.
* Accessing a property on an element that doesn't exist caused an error, for example: $("#foobar").attr("id")
* Calling .load() without a callback caused an error.
* You couldn't cancel an event that was triggered using .trigger() or .click() (for example).
* .add()ing a single DOM element to a jQuery object was broken.
* Passing in undefined values to a $.post() caused weird errors to occur.
* Accessing child nodes within an xml document didn't work properly.
* jQuery.isFunction() was unable to reliably determine a function, in a cross-browser way.
* Triggering a .click() failed in IE.
* Triggered click handlers were executed twice in most browsers.
* A newline passed into $(...) caused Firefox to go into a never-ending loop.
* Calling $.post() without any data caused an error.
* Calling a descendant selector after a child selector caused strange results, for example: $("ul > li ul")
* Triggered events did not occur if an event handler was not bound for that event.

== 1.1 ==

* Massive speed-ups (4x-10x) in the selector engine.
* You can now unbind event handlers from within themselves
* Added new .one( "type", fn ) method
* text(String) now escapes HTML
* Added attr(String,Function) to calculate the value
* Performming .click(), .blur(), .focus(), .submit() will actually trigger the browsers default action for those events.
* Added global settings for AJAX (in addition to timeout), use $.ajaxSetup() to modify them
* Implemented a better error handling for ajax requests. Exceptions caused by dropping connections are now handled, too.
* Improved event fixing (Opera provides event.srcElement, must ignore it if target is available; only create pageX if clientX is available)
* Fixed nth-child selectors to start on the right number
* jQuery is no longer destructive. Doing var a = $("a"); a.find("span"); does not change the original "a" variable.
* Fixed synchronous requests
* Fixed ID with context selectors (eg. div #id doesn't ignore "div" anymore)
* Fixed docs for html(): Now mentions that is not available for XML documents
* Improved AJAX docs (eg. more examples for $.ajax)
* Documented filter(Function), a very powerful approach for custom filtering
* Improved docs for FX module, merging method descriptions and marking optional arguments
* Improved docs for append, prepend, before and after, merging the three pairs into one
* Improved show/hide animations to show only hidden and hide only visible elements
* Removed .oneEvent() and .unEvent() helper methods.
* Removed all CSS helper methods.
* Removed most attribute helper methods.
* Removed the (undocumented) .find( "selector", fn ) for all destructive methods.
* $.get, $.getIfModified, $.post, $.getScript and $.getJSON now all pass through the XMLHttpRequest as returned by $.ajax

== 1.0.4 ==

* Tons of bug fixes
* Extensions to $.ajax: $.ajax accepts additonal options: beforeSend, async and processData; returns XMLHttpRequest to allow manual aborting of requests, see docs for details
* AJAX module: the public $.ajax API is now used internally (for $.get/$.post etc.); loading scripts works now much more reliable on all browers except Safari
* New global ajax handler: ajaxSend - called before an ajax request is sent
* Extensions to global ajax handlers: ajaxSend, ajaxSuccess, ajaxError and ajaxComplete get XMLHttpRequest and settings passed as arguments
* Extensions to event handling: pageX and pageY are available x-browser (IE does not provide native pageX/Y)
* Improved docs: $(String) method has now two seperate descriptions, one for selecting elements, one for creating (html on-the-fly)
* FX module: Most inline stlyes added by animations are now removed when the animation is complete, eg. height style when animating height (exception: display styles)
* Added note to attr(String, Object) about issues with setting the name property on input elements
* Seperated internal stuff from get() into set()
* Merged the two API examples for each() into one more precise example
* Improved docs for $.browser and added docs for $.boxModel
* Docs for the jQuery constructor $() were improved: There is now $(String expression[, Object context]) and $(String html)
