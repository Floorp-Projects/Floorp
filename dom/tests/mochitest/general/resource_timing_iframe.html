  This file is a sub-test file for the Resource Timing and Performance Timeline
  APIs.
  These tests are focused on the iframe corner case.
  The first step is to check that the image from this document was added as
  an entry to this window.performance object.
  The second step is to check that this iframe was not added as an entry to its
  own window.performance object.
  As a final step, we do a double checking: no ifrmes were added as entries
  to this window.performance object.
