Objects Replaced by Navigations
===============================

There are 3 major types of navigations, each of which can cause different
objects to be replaced. The general rules look something like this:

.. csv-table:: objects replaced or preserved across navigations
   :header: "Class/Id", ":ref:`in-process navigations <in-process navigations>`", ":ref:`cross-process navigations <cross-process navigations>`", ":ref:`cross-group navigations <cross-group navigations>`"

   "BrowserId [#bid]_", |preserve|, |preserve|, |preserve|
   "BrowsingContextWebProgress", |preserve|, |preserve|, |preserve|
   "BrowsingContextGroup", |preserve|, |preserve|, |replace|
   "BrowsingContext", |preserve|, |preserve|, |replace|
   "nsFrameLoader", |preserve|, |replace|, |replace|
   "RemoteBrowser", |preserve|, |replace|, |replace|
   "Browser{Parent,Child}", |preserve|, |replace|, |replace|
   "nsDocShell", |preserve|, |replace|, |replace|
   "nsGlobalWindowOuter", |preserve|, |replace|, |replace|
   "nsGlobalWindowInner", "|replace| [#inner]_", |replace|, |replace|
   "WindowContext", "|replace| [#inner]_", |replace|, |replace|
   "WindowGlobal{Parent,Child}", "|replace| [#inner]_", |replace|, |replace|
   "Document", "|replace|", |replace|, |replace|


.. |replace| replace:: ❌ replaced
.. |preserve| replace:: ✔️ preserved

.. [#bid]

   The BrowserId is a unique ID on each ``BrowsingContext`` object, obtained
   using ``GetBrowserId``, not a class. This ID will persist even when a
   ``BrowsingContext`` is replaced (e.g. due to
   ``Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy``).

.. [#inner]

   When navigating from the initial ``about:blank`` document to a same-origin
   document, the same ``nsGlobalWindowInner``, ``WindowContext`` and
   ``WindowGlobal{Parent,Child}`` may be used. This initial ``about:blank``
   document is the one created when synchronously accessing a newly-created
   pop-up window from ``window.open``, or a newly-created document in an
   ``<iframe>``.

Types of Navigations
--------------------

.. _in-process navigations:

in-process navigations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An in-process navigation is the traditional type of navigation, and the most
common type of navigation when :ref:`Fission` is not enabled.

These navigations are used when no process switching or BrowsingContext
replacement is required, which includes most navigations with Fission
disabled, and most same site-origin navigations when Fission is enabled.

.. _cross-process navigations:

cross-process navigations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A cross-process navigation is used when a navigation requires a process
switch to occur, and no BrowsingContext replacement is required. This is a
common type of load when :ref:`Fission` is enabled, though it is also used
for navigations to and from special URLs like ``file://`` URIs when
Fission is disabled.

These process changes are triggered by ``DocumentLoadListener`` when it
determines that a process switch is required. See that class's documentation
for more details.

.. _cross-group navigations:

cross-group navigations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A cross-group navigation is used when the navigation's `response requires
a browsing context group switch
<https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/origin.html#browsing-context-group-switches-due-to-cross-origin-opener-policy>`_.

These types of switches may or may not cause the process to change, but will
finish within a different ``BrowsingContextGroup`` than they started with.
Like :ref:`cross-process navigations`, these navigations are triggered using
the process switching logic in ``DocumentLoadListener``.

As the parent of a content browsing context cannot change due to a navigation,
only toplevel content browsing contexts can cross-group navigate. Navigations in
chrome browsing contexts [#chromebc]_ or content subframes only experience
either in-process or cross-process navigations.

As of the time of this writing, we currently trigger a cross-group navigation
in the following circumstances, though this may change in the future:

- If the `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy
  <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/origin.html#the-cross-origin-opener-policy-header>`_
  header is specified, and a mismatch is detected.
- When switching processes between the parent process, and a content process.
- When loading an extension document in a toplevel browsing context.
- When navigating away from a preloaded ``about:newtab`` document.
- Sometimes, when loading a document with the ``Large-Allocation`` header on
  32-bit windows.
- When putting a ``BrowsingContext`` into BFCache for the session history
  in-parent BFCache implementation. This will happen on most toplevel
  navigations without opener relationships when the ``fission.bfcacheInParent``
  pref is enabled.

State which needs to be saved over cross-group navigations on
``BrowsingContext`` instances is copied in the
``CanonicalBrowsingContext::ReplacedBy`` method.

.. [#chromebc]

   A chrome browsing context does **not** refer to pages with the system
   principal loaded in the content area such as ``about:preferences``.
   Chrome browsing contexts are generally used as the root context in a chrome
   window, such where ``browser.xhtml`` is loaded for a browser window.

   All chrome browsing contexts exclusively load in the parent process and
   cannot process switch when navigating.
