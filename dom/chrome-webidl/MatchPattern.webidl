/**
 * A URL match pattern as used by the WebExtension and Chrome extension APIs.
 *
 * A match pattern is a string with one of the following formats:
 *
 *  - "<all_urls>"
 *    The literal string "<all_urls>" matches any URL with a supported
 *    protocol.
 *
 *  - <proto>://<host>/<path>
 *    A URL pattern with the following placeholders:
 *
 *    - <proto>
 *      The protocol to match, or "*" to match either "http" or "https".
 *    - <host>
 *      The hostname to match. May be either a complete, literal hostname to
 *      match a specific host, the wildcard character "*", to match any host,
 *      or a subdomain pattern, with "*." followed by a domain name, to match
 *      that domain name or any subdomain thereof.
 *    - <path>
 *      A glob pattern for paths to match. A "*" may appear anywhere within
 *      the path, and will match any string of characters. If no "*" appears,
 *      the URL path must exactly match the pattern path.
