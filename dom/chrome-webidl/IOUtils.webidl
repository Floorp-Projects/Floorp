/**
 * IOUtils is a simple, efficient interface for performing file I/O from a
 * privileged chrome-only context. All asynchronous I/O tasks are run on
 * a background thread.
 *
 * Pending I/O tasks will block shutdown at the |profileBeforeChange| phase.
 * During this shutdown phase, no additional I/O tasks will be accepted --
 * method calls to this interface will reject once shutdown has entered this
 * phase.
 *
 * IOUtils methods may reject for any number of reasons. Reasonable attempts
 * have been made to map each common operating system error to a |DOMException|.
 * Most often, a caller only needs to check if a given file wasn't found by
 * catching the rejected error and checking if |ex.name === 'NotFoundError'|.
 * In other cases, it is likely sufficient to allow the error to be caught and
 * reported elsewhere.
