 * The nsIDOMParser interface is a non-SAX interface that can be used
 * to parse a string or byte stream containing XML or HTML content
 * to a DOM document. Parsing is always synchronous - a document is always
 * returned from the parsing methods. This is as opposed to loading and
 * parsing with the XMLHttpRequest interface, which can be used for
 * asynchronous (callback-based) loading.
