/**
 * This interface represents a content node that loads images.  The interface
 * exists to allow getting information on the images that the content node
 * loads and to allow registration of observers for the image loads.
 *
 * Implementors of this interface should handle all the mechanics of actually
 * loading an image -- getting the URI, checking with content policies and
 * the security manager to see whether loading the URI is allowed, performing
 * the load, firing any DOM events as needed.
 *
 * An implementation of this interface may support the concepts of a
 * "current" image and a "pending" image.  If it does, a request to change
 * the currently loaded image will start a "pending" request which will
 * become current only when the image is loaded.  It is the responsibility of
 * observers to check which request they are getting notifications for.
 *
 * Please make sure to update the MozImageLoadingContent WebIDL
 * interface to mirror this interface when changing it.
