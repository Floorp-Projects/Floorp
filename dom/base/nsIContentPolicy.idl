   * Always use a more specific type if one is available. And do not hesitate
   * to add more types as appropriate.
   * But if you are fairly sure that no one would care about your more specific
   * type, then it's ok to use TYPE_OTHER.
   *
   * Extension developers: Whenever it is reasonable, use one of the existing
   * content types. If none of the existing content types are right for
   * something you are doing, file a bug in the Core/DOM component that
   * includes a patch that adds your new content type to the end of the list of
   * TYPE_* constants here. But, don't start using your new content type until
   * your patch has been accepted, because it will be uncertain what exact
   * value and name your new content type will have; in that interim period,
   * use TYPE_OTHER. In your patch, document your new content type in the style
   * of the existing ones. In the bug you file, provide a more detailed
   * description of the new type of content you want Gecko to support, so that
   * the existing implementations of nsIContentPolicy can be properly modified
   * to deal with that new type of content.
   *
   * Implementations of nsIContentPolicy should treat this the same way they
   * treat unknown types, because existing users of TYPE_OTHER may be converted
   * to use new content types.
   *
   * Note that the TYPE_INTERNAL_* constants are never passed to content
   * policy implementations.  They are mapped to other TYPE_* constants, and
   * are only intended for internal usage inside Gecko.
