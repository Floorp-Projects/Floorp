// This file defines a list of use counters, which are things that can
// record usage of Web platform features and then report this information
// through Telemetry.
//
// The format of this file is very strict.  Each line can be:
//
//   (a) a blank line
//
//   (b) a comment, which is a line that begins with "//"
//
//   (c) one of four possible use counter declarations:
//
//         method <IDL interface name>.<IDL operation name>
//         attribute <IDL interface name>.<IDL attribute name>
//         custom <any valid identifier> <description>
//
// The <description> for custom counters will be appended to "Whether a
// dedicated worker " or "Whether a shared worker" or "Whether a service worker
//  ", so phrase it appropriately.  For instance, "constructs a
// Foo object" or "calls Bar.baz('some value')". It may contain any character
// (including whitespace).
//
// To actually cause use counters to be incremented, DOM methods
// and attributes must have a [UseCounter] extended attribute and be exposed to
// workers in the Web IDL file.
// Custom counters are incremented when
// SetUseCounter(UseCounterWoker::Custom_MyName) is called on a WorkerPrivate
// object.
//
// You might reasonably ask why we have this file and we require
// annotating things with [UseCounter] in the relevant WebIDL file as
// well.  Generating things from bindings codegen and ensuring all the
// dependencies were correct would have been rather difficult.
