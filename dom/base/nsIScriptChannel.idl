 * An interface representing a channel which will have to execute some sort of
 * program provided via its URI to compute the data it should return.
 *
 * If a channel implements this interface, the execution of the program in
 * question will be restricted in the following ways:
 *
 * - If the channel does not have an owner principal, the program will not be
 *   executed at all, no matter what.  This is necessary because in this
 *   circumstance we have no way to tell whether script execution is allowed at
 *   all for the originating security context of this channel.
 * - If the channel has an owner principal, how it is executed is controlled by
 *   this interface.  However if the owner principal does not subsume the
 *   principal of the environment in which the program is to be executed the
 *   execution will be forced to happen in a sandbox.
