  /** Test for Bug 1247733 **/

  /**
   * This test ensures that we render the SVG 'use' element correctly, in
   * pages that have been upgraded from HTTP to HTTPS using strict transport
   * security (HSTS)
   *
   * Specifically:
   *  (1) We load a file using HTTPS, in an iframe. The file gets sent
   *      with a Strict-Transport-Security flag.
   *  (2) We load the same file again, but now over HTTP (which should get
   *      upgraded to HTTPS, since we received the Strict-Transport-Security
   *      flag during the first load).
   *  (3) After each of the above loads, we take a snapshot of the iframe
   *      and ensure that it renders as fully lime (which the 'use' element
   *      is responsible for). If the 'use' element fails to render, the iframe
   *      will be fully red, and we'll fail an "assertSnapshots" check.
