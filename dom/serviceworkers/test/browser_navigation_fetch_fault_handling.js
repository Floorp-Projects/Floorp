/**
 * This test file tests our automatic recovery and any related mitigating
 * heuristics that occur during intercepted navigation fetch request.
 * Specifically, we should be resetting interception so that we go to the
 * network in these cases and then potentially taking actions like unregistering
 * the ServiceWorker and/or clearing QuotaManager-managed storage for the
 * origin.
 *
 * See specific test permutations for specific details inline in the test.
 *
 * NOTE THAT CURRENTLY THIS TEST IS DISCUSSING MITIGATIONS THAT ARE NOT YET
 * IMPLEMENTED, JUST PLANNED.  These will be iterated on and added to the rest
 * of the stack of patches on Bug 1503072.
 *
 * ## Test Mechanics
 *
 * ### Fetch Fault Injection
 *
 * We expose:
 * - On nsIServiceWorkerInfo, the per-ServiceWorker XPCOM interface:
 *   - A mechanism for creating synthetic faults by setting the
 *     `nsIServiceWorkerInfo::testingInjectCancellation` attribute to a failing
 *     nsresult.  The fault is applied at the beginning of the steps to dispatch
 *     the fetch event on the global.
 *   - A count of the number of times we experienced these navigation faults
 *     that had to be reset as `nsIServiceWorkerInfo::navigationFaultCount`.
 *     (This would also include real faults, but we only expect to see synthetic
 *     faults in this test.)
 * - On nsIServiceWorkerRegistrationInfo, the per-registration XPCOM interface:
 *   - A readonly attribute that indicates how many times an origin storage
 *     usage check has been initiated.
 *
 * We also use:
 * - `nsIServiceWorkerManager::addListener(nsIServiceWorkerManagerListener)`
 *   allows our test to listen for the unregistration of registrations.  This
 *   allows us to be notified when unregistering or origin-clearing actions have
 *   been taken as a mitigation.
 *
 * ### General Test Approach
 *
 * For each test we:
 * - Ensure/confirm the testing origin has no QuotaManager storage in use.
 * - Install the ServiceWorker.
 * - If we are testing the situation where we want to simulate the origin being
 *   near its quota limit, we also generate Cache API and IDB storage usage
 *   sufficient to put our origin over the threshold.
 *   - We run a quota check on the origin after doing this in order to make sure
 *     that we did this correctly and that we properly constrained the limit for
 *     the origin.  We fail the test for test implementation reasons if we
 *     didn't accomplish this.
 * - Verify a fetch navigation to the SW works without any fault injection,
 *   producing a result produced by the ServiceWorker.
 * - Begin fault permutations in a loop, where for each pass of the loop:
 *   - We trigger a navigation which will result in an intercepted fetch
 *     which will fault.  We wait until the navigation completes.
 *   - We verify that we got the request from the network.
 *   - We verify that the ServiceWorker's navigationFaultCount increased.
 *   - If this the count at which we expect a mitigation to take place, we wait
 *     for the registration to become unregistered AND:
 *     - We check whether the storage for the origin was cleared or not, which
 *       indicates which mitigation of the following happened:
 *       - Unregister the registration directly.
 *       - Clear the origin's data which will also unregister the registration
 *         as a side effect.
 *     - We check whether the registration indicates an origin quota check
 *       happened or not.
 *
 * ### Disk Usage Limits
 *
 * In order to avoid gratuitous disk I/O and related overheads, we limit QM
 * ("temporary") storage to 10 MiB which ends up limiting group usage to 10 MiB.
 * This lets us set a threshold situation where we claim that a SW needs at
 * least 4 MiB of storage for installation/operation, meaning that any usage
 * beyond 6 MiB in the group will constitute a need to clear the group or
 * origin.  We fill with the storage with 8 MiB of artificial usage to this end,
 * storing 4 MiB in Cache API and 4 MiB in IDB.
