/**
 * The nsIDOMSimpleGestureEvent interface is the datatype for all
 * Mozilla-specific simple gesture events in the Document Object Model.
 *
 * The following events are generated:
 *
 * MozSwipeGesture - Generated when the user completes a swipe across
 * across the input device.
 *
 * MozMagnifyGestureStart - Generated when the user begins the magnify
 * ("pinch") gesture.  The "delta" value represents the initial
 * movement.
 *
 * MozMagnifyGestureUpdate - Generated periodically while the user is
 * continuing the magnify ("pinch") gesture.  The "delta" value
 * represents the movement since the last MozMagnifyGestureStart or
 * MozMagnifyGestureUpdate event.
 *
 * MozMagnifyGesture - Generated when the user has completed the
 * magnify ("pinch") gesture.  If you only want to receive a single
 * event when the magnify gesture is complete, you only need to hook
 * this event and can safely ignore the MozMagnifyGestureStart and the
 * MozMagnifyGestureUpdate events. The "delta" value is the cumulative
 * amount represented by the user's gesture.
 *
 * MozRotateGestureStart - Generated when the user begins the rotation
 * gesture.  The "delta" value represents the initial rotation.
 *
 * MozRotateGestureUpdate - Generated periodically while the user is
 * continuing the rotation gesture.  The "delta" value represents the
 * rotation since the last MozRotateGestureStart or
 * MozRotateGestureUpdate event.
 *
 * MozRotateGesture - Generated when the user has completed the
 * rotation gesture.  If you only want to receive a single event when
 * the rotation gesture is complete, you only need to hook this event
 * and can safely ignore the MozRotateGestureStart and the
 * MozRotateGestureUpdate events.  The "delta" value is the cumulative
 * amount of rotation represented by the user's gesture.
 *
 * MozTapGesture - Generated when the user executes a two finger
 * tap gesture on the input device. Client coordinates contain the
 * center point of the tap.
 * (XXX Not implemented on Mac)
 *
 * MozPressTapGesture - Generated when the user executes a press
 * and tap two finger gesture (first finger down, second finger down,
 * second finger up, first finger up) on the input device.
 * Client coordinates contain the center pivot point of the action.
 * (XXX Not implemented on Mac)
 *
 * Default behavior:
 *
 * Some operating systems support default behaviors for gesture events
 * when they are not handled by the application. Consumers should
 * use event.preventDefault() to prevent default behavior when
 * consuming events.
