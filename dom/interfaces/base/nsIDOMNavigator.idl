  /**
   * Pulse the device's vibrator, if it has one.  If the device does not have a
   * vibrator, this function does nothing.  If the window is hidden, this
   * function does nothing.
   *
   * mozVibrate takes one argument, which specifies either how long to vibrate
   * for or gives a pattern of vibrator-on/vibrator-off timings.
   *
   * If a vibration pattern is in effect when this function is called, this
   * call will overwrite the existing pattern, if this call successfully
   * completes.
   *
   * We handle the argument to mozVibrate as follows.
   *
   * - If the argument is undefined or null, we throw
   *   NS_ERROR_DOM_NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR.
   *
   * - If the argument is 0, the empty list, or a list containing entirely 0s,
   *   we cancel any outstanding vibration pattern; that is, we stop the device
   *   from vibrating.
   *
   * - Otherwise, if the argument X is not a list, we treat it as though it's
   *   the singleton list [X] and then proceed as below.
   *
   * - If the argument is a list (or if we wrapped it as a list above), then we
   *   try to convert each element in the list to an integer, by first
   *   converting it to a number and then rounding.  If there is some element
   *   that we can't convert to an integer, or if any of the integers are
   *   negative, we throw NS_ERROR_DOM_NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR.
   *
   *   This list of integers specifies a vibration pattern.  Given a list of
   *   numbers
   *
   *      [a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, ..., a_n]
   *
   *   the device will vibrate for a_1 milliseconds, then be still for b_1
   *   milliseconds, then vibrate for a_2 milliseconds, and so on.
   *
   *   The list may contain an even or an odd number of elements, but if you
   *   pass an even number of elements (that is, if your list ends with b_n
   *   instead of a_n), the final element doesn't specify anything meaningful.
   *
   *   We may throw NS_ERROR_DOM_NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR if the vibration pattern is
   *   too long, or if any of its elements is too large.

  /**
   * Request a wake lock for a resource.
   *
   * A page holds a wake lock to request that a resource not be turned
   * off (or otherwise made unavailable).
   *
   * The topic is the name of a resource that might be made unavailable for
   * various reasons. For example, on a mobile device the power manager might
   * decide to turn off the screen after a period of idle time to save power.
   *
   * The resource manager checks the lock state of a topic before turning off
   * the associated resource. For example, a page could hold a lock on the
   * "screen" topic to prevent the screensaver from appearing or the screen
   * from turning off.
   *
   * The resource manager defines what each topic means and sets policy.  For
   * example, the resource manager might decide to ignore 'screen' wake locks
   * held by pages which are not visible.
   *
   * One topic can be locked multiple times; it is considered released only when
   * all locks on the topic have been released.
   *
   * The returned nsIDOMMozWakeLock object is a token of the lock.  You can
   * unlock the lock via the object's |unlock| method.  The lock is released
   * automatically when its associated window is unloaded.
   *
