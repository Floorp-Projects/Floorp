   * The parameter can be a DOMString or an Array of DOMStrings.  If you pass a
   * string, we lock the screen to that one orientation.  If you pass an Array,
   * we ensure that the screen is always in one of the given orientations.
   *
   * Valid orientations are "portrait", "portrait-primary",
   * "portrait-secondary", "landscape", "landscape-primary", and
   * "landscape-secondary".
   * These tokens are case-sensitive.
   *
   * If you pass a string that's not one of the valid orientations, or if you
   * pass an array of orientations and any of the orientations in the array is
   * not valid, we reject the lock and return false.
   *
   * The "-primary" orientations correspond to holding the device right-side up,
   * while the "-secondary" orientations correspond to holding the device
   * upside-down.	Locking the orientation in "portrait" is the same as locking
   * the orientation in ['portrait-primary', 'portrait-secondary'], and the
   * "landscape" orientation similarly corresponds to the set
   * ['landscape-primary', 'landscape-secondary'].
