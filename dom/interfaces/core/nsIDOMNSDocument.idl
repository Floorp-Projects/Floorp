   *   canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
   *   canvas.setAttribute("width", 100);
   *   canvas.setAttribute("height", 100);
   *   // draw to canvas

   * @param aImageElementId an image element ID to associate with
   * |aImageElement|
   * @param aImageElement a DOM element to be used as the source image of
