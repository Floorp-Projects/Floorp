# Encoding warnings and errors
EncNoDeclarationFrame=The character encoding of a framed document was not declared. The document may appear different if viewed without the document framing it.
EncXmlDecl=The character encoding of an HTML document was declared using the XML declaration syntax. This is non-conforming, and declaring the encoding using a meta tag at the start of the head part is more efficient.
EncMetaTooLate=A meta tag attempting to declare the character encoding declaration was found too late, and the encoding was guessed from content instead. The meta tag needs to be moved to the start of the head part of the document.
EncMetaTooLateFrame=A meta tag attempting to declare the character encoding declaration was found too late, and the encoding of the parent document was used instead. The meta tag needs to be moved to the start of the head part of the document.
EncMetaAfterHeadInKilobyte=The meta tag declaring the character encoding of the document should be moved to start of the head part of the document.
EncNoDecl=The character encoding of the document was not declared, so the encoding was guessed from content. The character encoding needs to be declared in the Content-Type HTTP header, using a meta tag, or using a byte order mark.
EncNoDeclPlain=The character encoding of the document was not declared, so the encoding was guessed from content. The character encoding needs to be declared in the Content-Type HTTP header or using a byte order mark.
EncMetaUnsupported=An unsupported character encoding was declared for the HTML document using a meta tag. The declaration was ignored.
EncProtocolUnsupported=An unsupported character encoding was declared on the transfer protocol level. The declaration was ignored.
EncMetaUtf16=A meta tag was used to declare the character encoding as UTF-16. This was interpreted as an UTF-8 declaration instead.
EncMetaUserDefined=A meta tag was used to declare the character encoding as x-user-defined. This was interpreted as a windows-1252 declaration instead for compatibility with intentionally mis-encoded legacy fonts. This site should migrate to Unicode.
EncMetaReplacement=A meta tag was used to declare an encoding that is a cross-site scripting hazard. The replacement encoding was used instead.
EncProtocolReplacement=An encoding that is a cross-site scripting hazard was declared on the transfer protocol level. The replacement encoding was used instead.
EncDetectorReload=The character encoding of the document was not declared, and the encoding was guessable from content only late. This caused the document to be reloaded. The character encoding needs to be declared in the Content-Type HTTP header, using a meta tag, or using a byte order mark.
EncDetectorReloadPlain=The character encoding of the document was not declared, and the encoding was guessable from content only late. This caused the document to be reloaded. The character encoding needs to be declared in the Content-Type HTTP header or using a byte order mark.
EncError=The byte stream was erroneous according to the character encoding that was declared. The character encoding declaration may be incorrect.
EncErrorFrame=The byte stream was erroneous according to the character encoding that was inherited from the parent document. The character encoding needs to be declared in the Content-Type HTTP header, using a meta tag, or using a byte order mark.
EncErrorFramePlain=The byte stream was erroneous according to the character encoding that was inherited from the parent document. The character encoding needs to be declared in the Content-Type HTTP header or using a byte order mark.
EncSpeculationFailMeta=The start of the document was reparsed, because there were non-ASCII characters before the meta tag that declared the encoding. The meta should be the first child of head without non-ASCII comments before.
EncSpeculationFailXml=The start of the document was reparsed, because there were non-ASCII characters in the part of the document that was unsuccessfully searched for a meta tag before falling back to the XML declaration syntax. A meta tag at the start of the head part should be used instead of the XML declaration syntax.
# The audience of the following message isn't the author of the document but other people debugging browser behavior.
EncSpeculationFail2022=The start of the document was reparsed, because ISO-2022-JP is an ASCII-incompatible encoding.
