TablePartRelPosWarning=Relative positioning of table rows and row groups is now supported. This site may need to be updated because it may depend on this feature having no effect.
ScrollLinkedEffectFound2=This site appears to use a scroll-linked positioning effect. This may not work well with asynchronous panning; see https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Performance/ScrollLinkedEffects for further details and to join the discussion on related tools and features!

## (%5$S, %6$S) is a pair of integer values of the visual rectangle size
## (%7$S) is an integer value
AnimationWarningContentTooLarge=Async animation disabled because frame size (%1$S, %2$S) is bigger than the viewport (%3$S, %4$S) or the visual rectangle (%5$S, %6$S) is larger than the max allowed value (%7$S)
