Test chrome-only MutationObserver animation notifications (async tests)
</title>
<!--

  This file contains tests for animation mutation observers that require
  some asynchronous steps (e.g. waiting for animation events).

  Where possible, however, we prefer to write synchronous tests since they are
  less to timeout when run on automation. These synchronous tests are located
  in test_animation_observers_sync.html.
