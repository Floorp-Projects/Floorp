# Since we define MOCHITEST_FILES, config/makefiles/mochitest.mk goes ahead and
# sets up a rule with libs:: in itm which makes our .DEFAULT_TARGET be "libs".
# Then ruls.mk does |.DEFAULT_TARGET ?= default| which leaves it as "libs".  So
# if we make without an explicit target in this directory, we try to make
# "libs", but with a $(MAKECMDGOALS) of empty string.  And then rules.mk
# helpfully does not include our *.o.pp files, since it includes them only if
# filtering some stuff out from $(MAKECMDGOALS) leaves it nonempty.  The upshot
# is that if some headers change and we run make in this dir without an explicit
# target things don't get rebuilt.
#
# On the other hand, if we set .DEFAULT_TARGET to "default" explicitly here,
# then rules.mk will reinvoke make with "export" and "libs" but this time hey
# will be passed as explicit targets, show up in $(MAKECMDGOALS), and things
# will work.  Do this at the end of our Makefile so the rest of the build system
