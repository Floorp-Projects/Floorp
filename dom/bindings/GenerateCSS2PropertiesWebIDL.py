    #
    # 1) Each supported CSS property name, camelCased.
    # 2) Each supported name that contains dashes but doesn't start with a
    #    dash, without any changes to the name.
    # 3) cssFloat
    #
    # Note that "float" will cause a property called "float" to exist due to (1)
    # in that list.
    #
    # In practice, cssFloat is the only case in which "name" doesn't contain "-"
    # but also doesn't match "prop".  So the stuff we did with "prop" covers (3)
    # and all of (1) except "float".   If we now output attributes for all the
    # cases where "name" doesn't match "prop" and "name" doesn't start with "-",
    # that will cover "float" and (2).
