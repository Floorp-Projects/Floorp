WebIDL
======

WebIDL describes interfaces web browsers are supposed to implement.

The interaction between WebIDL and the build system is somewhat complex.
This document will attempt to explain how it all works.

Overview
========

``.webidl`` files throughout the tree define interfaces the browser
implements. Since Gecko/Firefox is implemented in C++, there is a
mechanism to convert these interfaces and associated metadata to
C++ code. That's where the build system comes into play.

All the code for interacting with ``.webidl`` files lives under
``dom/bindings``. There is code in the build system to deal with
WebIDLs explicitly.

WebIDL source file flavors
==========================

Not all ``.webidl`` files are created equal! There are several flavors,
each represented by a separate symbol from :ref:`mozbuild_symbols`.

WEBIDL_FILES
   Refers to regular/static ``.webidl`` files. Most WebIDL interfaces
   are defined this way.

GENERATED_EVENTS_WEBIDL_FILES
   In addition to generating a binding, these ``.webidl`` files also
   generate a source file implementing the event object in C++

PREPROCESSED_WEBIDL_FILES
   The ``.webidl`` files are generated by preprocessing an input file.
   They otherwise behave like *WEBIDL_FILES*.

TEST_WEBIDL_FILES
   Like *WEBIDL_FILES* but the interfaces are for testing only and
   aren't shipped with the browser.

PREPROCESSED_TEST_WEBIDL_FILES
   Like *TEST_WEBIDL_FILES* except the ``.webidl`` is obtained via
   preprocessing, much like *PREPROCESSED_WEBIDL_FILES*.

GENERATED_WEBIDL_FILES
   The ``.webidl`` for these is obtained through an *external*
   mechanism. Typically there are custom build rules for producing these
   files.

Producing C++ code
==================

The most complicated part about WebIDLs is the process by which
``.webidl`` files are converted into C++.

This process is handled by code in the :py:mod:`mozwebidlcodegen`
package. :py:class:`mozwebidlcodegen.WebIDLCodegenManager` is
specifically where you want to look for how code generation is
performed. This includes complex dependency management.

Requirements
============

This section aims to document the build and developer workflow requirements
for WebIDL.

Parser unit tests
   There are parser tests provided by ``dom/bindings/parser/runtests.py``
   that should run as part of ``make check``. There must be a mechanism
   to run the tests in *human* mode so they output friendly error
   messages.

   The current mechanism for this is ``mach webidl-parser-test``.

Mochitests
   There are various mochitests under ``dom/bindings/test``. They should
   be runnable through the standard mechanisms.

Working with test interfaces
   ``TestExampleGenBinding.cpp`` calls into methods from the
   ``TestExampleInterface`` and ``TestExampleProxyInterface`` interfaces.
   These interfaces need to be generated as part of the build. These
   interfaces should not be exported or packaged.

   There is a ``compiletests`` make target in ``dom/bindings`` that
   isn't part of the build that facilitates turnkey code generation
   and test file compilation.

Minimal rebuilds
   Reprocessing every output for every change is expensive. So we don't
   inconvenience people changing ``.webidl`` files, the build system
   should only perform a minimal rebuild when sources change.

   This logic is mostly all handled in
   :py:class:`mozwebidlcodegen.WebIDLCodegenManager`. The unit tests for
   that Python code should adequately test typical rebuild scenarios.

   Bug 940469 tracks making the existing implementation better.

Explicit method for performing codegen
   There needs to be an explicit method for invoking code generation.
   It needs to cover regular and test files.

   This is implemented via ``make export`` in ``dom/bindings``.

No-op binding generation should be fast
   So developers touching ``.webidl`` files are not inconvenienced,
   no-op binding generation should be fast. Watch out for the build system
   processing large dependency files it doesn't need in order to perform
   code generation.

Ability to generate example files
   *Any* interface can have example ``.h``/``.cpp`` files generated.
   There must be a mechanism to facilitate this.

   This is currently facilitated through ``mach webidl-example``. e.g.
   ``mach webidl-example HTMLStyleElement``.
