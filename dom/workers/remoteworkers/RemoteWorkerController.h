 * 1. When a new process starts, it creates a RemoteWorkerService singleton.
 *    This service creates a new thread (Worker Launcher) and from there, it
 *    starts a PBackground RemoteWorkerServiceChild actor.
 * 2. On the parent process, PBackground thread, RemoteWorkerServiceParent
 *    actors are registered into the RemoteWorkerManager service.
 *
 * 3. At some point, a SharedWorker or a ServiceWorker must be executed.
 *    RemoteWorkerController::Create() is used to start the launching. This
 *    method must be called on the parent process, on the PBackground thread.
 * 4. RemoteWorkerController object is immediately returned to the caller. Any
 *    operation done with this controller object will be stored in a queue,
 *    until the launching is correctly executed.
 * 5. RemoteWorkerManager has the list of active RemoteWorkerServiceParent
 *    actors. From them, it picks one.
 *    In case we don't have any content process to select, a new one is
 *    spawned. If this happens, the operation is suspended until a new
 *    RemoteWorkerServiceParent is registered.
 * 6. RemoteWorkerServiceParent is used to create a RemoteWorkerParent.
 * 7. RemoteWorkerChild is created on a selected process and it executes the
 *    WorkerPrivate.
 * 8. The RemoteWorkerParent actor is passed to the RemoteWorkerController.
 * 9. RemoteWorkerController now is ready to continue and it called
 *    RemoteWorkerObserver to inform that the operation is completed.
 *    In case there were pending operations, they are now executed.
