// The code in this file is responsible for throttling JS execution. It does
// this by introducing a JSExecutionManager class. An execution manager may be
// applied to any number of worker threads or a DocGroup on the main thread.
//
// JS environments associated with a JS execution manager may only execute on a
// certain amount of CPU cores in parallel.
//
// Whenever the main thread, or a worker thread begins executing JS it should
// make sure AutoRequestJSThreadExecution is present on the stack, in practice
// this is done by it being part of AutoEntryScript.
//
// Whenever the main thread may end up blocking on the activity of a worker
// thread, it should make sure to have an AutoYieldJSThreadExecution object
// on the stack.
//
// Whenever a worker thread may end up blocking on the main thread or the
// activity of another worker thread, it should make sure to have an
// AutoYieldJSThreadExecution object on the stack.
//
// Failure to do this may result in a deadlock. When a deadlock occurs due
// to these circumstances we will crash after 20 seconds.
//
// For the main thread this class should only be used in the case of an
// emergency surrounding exploitability of SharedArrayBuffers. A single
// execution manager will then be shared between all Workers and the main
// thread doc group containing the SharedArrayBuffer and ensure all this code
// only runs in a serialized manner. On the main thread we therefore may have
// 1 execution manager per DocGroup, as this is the granularity at which
// SharedArrayBuffers may be present.
