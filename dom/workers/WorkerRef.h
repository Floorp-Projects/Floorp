/*
 * If you want to play with a DOM Worker, you must know that it can go away
 * at any time if nothing prevents its shutting down. This documentation helps
 * to understand how to play with DOM Workers correctly.
 *
 * There are several reasons why a DOM Worker could go away. Here is the
 * complete list:
 *
 * a. GC/CC - If the DOM Worker thread is idle and the Worker object is garbage
 *    collected, it goes away.
 * b. The worker script can call self.close()
 * c. The Worker object calls worker.terminate()
 * d. Firefox is shutting down.
 *
 * When a DOM Worker goes away, it does several steps. See more in
 * WorkerStatus.h. The DOM Worker thread will basically stop scheduling
 * WorkerRunnables, and eventually WorkerControlRunnables. But if there is
 * something preventing the shutting down, it will always possible to dispatch
 * WorkerControlRunnables.  Of course, at some point, the worker _must_ be
 * released, otherwise firefox will leak it and the browser shutdown will hang.
 *
 * WeakWorkerRef is a refcounted, NON thread-safe object.
 *
 * From this object, you can obtain a WorkerPrivate, calling
 * WeakWorkerRef::GetPrivate(). It returns nullptr if the worker is shutting
 * down or if it is already gone away.
 *
 * If you want to know when a DOM Worker starts the shutting down procedure,
 * pass a callback to the mozilla::dom::WeakWorkerRef::Create() method.
 * Your function will be called. Note that _after_ the callback,
 * WeakWorkerRef::GetPrivate() will return nullptr.
 *
 * How to keep a DOM Worker alive?
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * If you need to keep the worker alive, you must use StrongWorkerRef.
 * You can have this refcounted, NON thread-safe object, calling
 * mozilla::dom::StrongWorkerRef::Create(WorkerPrivate* aWorkerPrivate);
 *
 * If you have a StrongWorkerRef:
 * a. the DOM Worker is kept alive.
 * b. you can have access to the WorkerPrivate, calling: Private().
 * c. WorkerControlRunnable can be dispatched.
 *
 * Note that the DOM Worker shutdown can start at any time, but having a
 * StrongWorkerRef prevents the full shutdown. Also with StrongWorkerRef, you
 * can pass a callback when calling mozilla::dom::StrongWorkerRef::Create().
 *
 * When the DOM Worker shutdown starts, WorkerRunnable cannot be dispatched
 * anymore. At this point, you should dispatch WorkerControlRunnable just to
 * release resources.
 *
 * How to have a thread-safe DOM Worker reference?
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * Sometimes you need to play with threads and you need a thread-safe worker
 * reference. ThreadSafeWorkerRef is what you want.
 *
 * Just because this object can be sent to different threads, we don't allow the
 * setting of a callback. It would be confusing.
 *
 * ThreadSafeWorkerRef can be destroyed in any thread. Internally it keeps a
 * reference to its StrongWorkerRef creator and this ref will be dropped on the
 * correct thread when the ThreadSafeWorkerRef is deleted.
 *
 * IPC WorkerRef
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * IPDL protocols require a correct shutdown sequence. Because of this, they
 * need a special configuration:
 * 1. they need to be informed when the Worker starts the shutting down
 * 2. they don't want to prevent the shutdown
 * 3. but at the same time, they need to block the shutdown until the WorkerRef
 *    is not longer alive.
 *
 * Point 1 is a standard feature of WorkerRef; point 2 is similar to
 * WeakWorkerRef; point 3 is similar to StrongWorkerRef.
 *
 * You can create a special IPC WorkerRef using this static method:
 * mozilla::dom::IPCWorkerRef::Create(WorkerPrivate* aWorkerPrivate,
 *                                    const char* * aName);
