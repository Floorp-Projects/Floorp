 * The CoreLocationObjects class contains the CoreLocation objects

 *
 * Declaring them directly in CoreLocationLocationProvider
 * would require Objective-C++ syntax, which would contaminate all
 * files that include this header and require them to be Objective-C++
 * as well.
 *
 * The solution then is to forward-declare CoreLocationObjects here and
 * hold a pointer to it in CoreLocationLocationProvider, and only actually
 * define it in CoreLocationLocationProvider.mm, thus making it safe
 * for Geolocation.cpp, which is C++-only, to include this header.
