/**
 * A driver is responsible for the scheduling of the processing, the thread
 * management, and give the different clocks to a MediaTrackGraph. This is an
 * abstract base class. A MediaTrackGraph can be driven by an
 * OfflineClockDriver, if the graph is offline, or a SystemClockDriver or an
 * AudioCallbackDriver, if the graph is real time.
 * A MediaTrackGraph holds an owning reference to its driver.
 *
 * The lifetime of drivers is a complicated affair. Here are the different
 * scenarii that can happen:
 *
 * Starting a MediaTrackGraph with an AudioCallbackDriver
 * - A new thread T is created, from the main thread.
 * - On this thread T, cubeb is initialized if needed, and a cubeb_stream is
 *   created and started
 * - The thread T posts a message to the main thread to terminate itself.
 * - The graph runs off the audio thread
 *
 * Starting a MediaTrackGraph with a SystemClockDriver:
 * - A new thread T is created from the main thread.
 * - The graph runs off this thread.
 *
 * Switching from a SystemClockDriver to an AudioCallbackDriver:
 * - At the end of the MTG iteration, the graph tells the current driver to
 *   switch to an AudioCallbackDriver, which is created and initialized on the
 *   graph thread.
 * - At the end of the MTG iteration, the SystemClockDriver transfers its timing
 *   info and a reference to itself to the AudioCallbackDriver. It then starts
 *   the AudioCallbackDriver.
 * - When the AudioCallbackDriver starts, it:
 *   - Starts a fallback SystemClockDriver that runs until the
 *     AudioCallbackDriver is running, in case it takes a long time to start (it
 *     could block on I/O, e.g., negotiating a bluetooth connection).
 *   - Checks if it has been switched from a SystemClockDriver, and if that is
 *     the case, sends a message to the main thread to shut the
 *     SystemClockDriver thread down.
 * - When the AudioCallbackDriver is running, data callbacks are blocked. The
 *   fallback driver detects this in its callback and stops itself. The first
 *   DataCallback after the fallback driver had stopped goes through.
 * - The graph now runs off an audio callback.
 *
 * Switching from an AudioCallbackDriver to a SystemClockDriver:
 * - At the end of the MTG iteration, the graph tells the current driver to
 *   switch to a SystemClockDriver.
 * - the AudioCallbackDriver transfers its timing info and a reference to itself
 *   to the SystemClockDriver. A new SystemClockDriver is started from the
 *   current audio thread.
 * - When starting, the SystemClockDriver checks if it has been switched from an
 *   AudioCallbackDriver. If yes, it creates a new temporary thread to release
 *   the cubeb_streams. This temporary thread closes the cubeb_stream, and then
 *   dispatches a message to the main thread to be terminated.
 * - The graph now runs off a normal thread.
 *
 * Two drivers cannot run at the same time for the same graph. The thread safety
 * of the different members of drivers, and their access pattern is documented
 * next to the members themselves.
