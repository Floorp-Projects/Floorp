/**
  * Verify that we can successfully call getUserMedia for the same device in
  * multiple iframes concurrently. This is checked by creating a number of
  * iframes and performing a separate getUserMedia call in each. We verify the
  * stream returned by that call has the same constraints as requested both
  * immediately after the call and after all gUM calls have been made. The test
  * then verifies the streams can be played.
