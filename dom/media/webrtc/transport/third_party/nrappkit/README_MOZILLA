This import of nrappkit is a subset of the distribution at:

  nrappkit.sourceforge.net


The last revision included in this import was on Nov 25, 2008.
This import includes a small nunber of portability fixes that
have been submitted to the upstream repository and are included
in upstream.diff.


Out of the list in the README, we use:

- registry-based configuration (with change callbacks)
  [but without the registry daemon]
- configurable logging system
- event and timer handling
  [though partly reimplemented]
 
Also, we use a bunch of the generic utilities such as string handling,
generic hash tables in C, yet another concrete type mapping, etc.
