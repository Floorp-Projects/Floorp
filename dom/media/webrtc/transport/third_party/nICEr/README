                             nICEr 1.0

PREREQUISITES:
-------------
You must first obtain and build the following packages:

* nrappkit
  - http://nrappkit.sourceforge.net/

* OpenSSL-0.9.8g
  - http://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.8g.tar.gz


For best results, the "ice-<version>" directory should be at
the same level as the "nrappkit" and "openssl-0.9.8g"
directories.  I.e., the directory structure should look like:

   nrappkit/
   ice-<version>/
   openssl/
          include/
          lib/VC/


BUILDING ON UNIX:
----------------
Once the prerequisite packages are built, 'cd' to the
relevant build directory, one of:

   ice-<version>/make/darwin
   ice-<version>/make/linux-fedora
   ice-<version>/make/ubuntu

and simply do a "make".


BUILDING ON WINDOWS:
-------------------
The Visual C++ project files are configured to expect the
directory structure described above.
 
Note: Binary Windows builds of OpenSSL can be found at:
   http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html

Once the prerequisite packages are built, open the VC++ 9.0
solution file: ICE/make/win32/ice.sln and build the solution.
Note: Since the VC++ project/solution files are version 9.0,
Visual Studio 2008 is required.


STATUS:
------
The ICE code has been tested on the following platforms:
-- Fedora Core 4 (Intel 32-bit)
-- Fedora Core 6 (Intel 32-bit)
-- Ubuntu 6.10 
-- MacOSX 10.4.9
-- Windows Vista (Home Premium)
-- Windows XP Pro
-- Windows 2000 SP4


KNOWN ISSUES:
------------
-- TURN SET-ACTIVE-DESTINATION mode not yet supported.

-- Problems may exist with the TURN client implementation; the TURN code
   has received minimal testing due to the unavailability of a real
   TURN server to test against.

-- The ICE-Lite implementation is not complete.

-- The new "impatient" timeout has not yet been thoroughly tested.
