// A stack of transport layers acts as a flow.
// Generally, one reads and writes to the top layer.

// This code has a confusing hybrid threading model which
// probably needs some eventual refactoring.
// TODO(ekr@rtfm.com): Bug 844891
//
// TransportFlows are not inherently bound to a thread *but*
// TransportLayers can be. If any layer in a flow is bound
// to a given thread, then all layers in the flow MUST be
// bound to that thread and you can only manipulate the
// flow (push layers, write, etc.) on that thread.
//
// The sole official exception to this is that you are
// allowed to *destroy* a flow off the bound thread provided
// that there are no listeners on its signals. This exception
// is designed to allow idioms where you create the flow
// and then something goes wrong and you destroy it and
// you don't want to bother with a thread dispatch.
//
// Eventually we hope to relax the "no listeners"
// restriction by thread-locking the signals, but previous
// attempts have caused deadlocks.
//
// Most of these invariants are enforced by hard asserts
// (i.e., those which fire even in production builds).
