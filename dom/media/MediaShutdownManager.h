// The MediaShutdownManager manages shutting down the MediaDecoder
// infrastructure in response to an xpcom-shutdown notification.
// This happens when Gecko is shutting down in the middle of operation.
// This is tricky, as there are a number of moving parts that must
// be shutdown in a particular order. The MediaShutdownManager
// encapsulates all these dependencies to ensure that no shutdown
// order dependencies leak out of the MediaDecoder stack.
// The MediaShutdownManager is a singleton.
//
// The MediaShutdownManager ensures that the MediaDecoder stack
// is shutdown before exiting xpcom-shutdown stage by registering
// itself with nsIAsyncShutdownService to receive notification
// when the stage of shutdown has started and then calls Shutdown()
// on every MediaDecoder. Shutdown will not proceed until all
// MediaDecoders finish shutdown and MediaShutdownManager unregisters
// itself from the async shutdown service.
//
// Note that calling the Unregister() functions may result in the singleton
// being deleted, so don't store references to the singleton, always use the
// singleton by derefing the referenced returned by
// MediaShutdownManager::Instance(), which ensures that the singleton is
// created when needed.
// i.e. like this:
//    MediaShutdownManager::Instance()::Unregister(someDecoder);
//    MediaShutdownManager::Instance()::Register(someOtherDecoder);
// Not like this:
//  MediaShutdownManager& instance = MediaShutdownManager::Instance();
//  instance.Unregister(someDecoder); // Warning! May delete instance!
//  instance.Register(someOtherDecoder); // BAD! instance may be dangling!
