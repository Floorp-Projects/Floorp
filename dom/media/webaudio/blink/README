This directory contains the code originally borrowed from the Blink Web Audio
implementation.  We are forking the code here because in many cases the burden
of adopting Blink specific utilities is too large compared to the prospect of
importing upstream fixes by just copying newer versions of the code in the
future.

The process of borrowing code from Blink is as follows:

* Try to borrow utility classes only, and avoid borrowing code which depends
  too much on the Blink specific utilities.
* First, import the pristine files from the Blink repository before adding
  them to the build system, noting the SVN revision of Blink from which the
  original files were copied in the commit message.
* In a separate commit, add the imported source files to the build system,
  and apply the necessary changes to make it build successfully.
* Use the code in a separate commit.
* Never add headers as exported headers.  All headers should be included
  using the following convention: #include "blink/Header.h".
* Leave the imported code in the WebCore namespace, and import the needed
  names into the Mozilla code via `using'.
* Cherry-pick upsteam fixes manually when needed.  In case you fix a problem
  that is not Mozilla specific locally, try to upstream your changes into
  Blink.
* Ping ehsan for any questions.
