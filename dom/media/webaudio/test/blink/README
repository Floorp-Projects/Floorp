This directory contains tests originally borrowed from the Blink Web Audio test
suite.

The process of borrowing tests from Blink is as follows:

* Import the pristine file from the Blink repo, noting the revision in the
  commit message.
* Modify the test files to turn the LayoutTest into a mochitest-plain and add
* them to the test suite in a separate commit.
