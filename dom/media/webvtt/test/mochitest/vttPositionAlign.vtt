Cue 7 : PositionAlign should be "auto", but computedPositionAlign should be "center".

NOTE ### These following cues are set with `align:start` ###

00:00.700 --> 00:00.800 align:start
LTR character in the beginning and align is "start", so computedPositionAlign should be "line-left".

00:00.700 --> 00:00.800 align:start
שלום RTL character in the beginning and align is "start", so computedPositionAlign should be "line-right".

00:00.700 --> 00:00.800 align:start
@ neutral charater in the beginning, but the first strong charater is LTR in "align:start". So computedPositionAlign should be "line-left".

00:00.700 --> 00:00.800 align:start
@ש neutral charater in the beginning, but the first strong charater is RTL in "align:start". So computedPositionAlign should be "line-right".

NOTE
This line contains only neutral charater, we would treat its base direction as
LTR. However, if there are other following lines contains non-neutral
charaters, we would detemine the base direction by the following line.

00:00.700 --> 00:00.800 align:start
@

00:00.700 --> 00:00.800 align:start
@
The second line starts with LTR charater, computedPositionAlign should be "line-left".

00:00.700 --> 00:00.800 align:start
@
שThe second line starts with RTL charater, computedPositionAlign should be "line-right".

NOTE ### These following cues are set with `align:end` ###

00:00.700 --> 00:00.800 align:end
LTR character in the beginning and align is "end", so computedPositionAlign should be "line-right".

00:00.700 --> 00:00.800 align:end
ש RTL character in the beginning and align is "end", so computedPositionAlign should be "line-left".
