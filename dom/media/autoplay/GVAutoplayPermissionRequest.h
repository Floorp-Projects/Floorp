/**
 * This class provides a method to request autoplay permission for a page, which
 * would be used to be a factor to determine if media is allowed to autoplay or
 * not on GeckoView.
 *
 * A page could only have at most one audible request and one inaudible request,
 * and once a page has been closed or reloaded, those requests would be dropped.
 * In order to achieve that all media existing in the same page can share the
 * result of those requests, the request status would only be stored in the
 * top-level browsing context, which allows them to be synchronized among
 * different processes when Fission is enabled.
 *
 * The current way we choose is to request for a permission when creating media
 * element, in order to get the response from the embedding app before media
 * starts playing if the app can response the request quickly enough. However,
 * the request might be pending if the app doesn't response to it, we might
 * never get the response. As that is just one factor of determining the
 * autoplay result, even if we don't get the response for the request, we still
 * have a chance to play media. Check AutoplayPolicy to see more details about
 * how we decide the final autoplay decision.
