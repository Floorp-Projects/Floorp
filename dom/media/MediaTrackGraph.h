/*
 * MediaTrackGraph is a framework for synchronized audio/video processing
 * and playback. It is designed to be used by other browser components such as
 * HTML media elements, media capture APIs, real-time media streaming APIs,
 * multitrack media APIs, and advanced audio APIs.
 *
 * The MediaTrackGraph uses a dedicated thread to process media --- the media
 * graph thread. This ensures that we can process media through the graph
 * without blocking on main-thread activity. The media graph is only modified
 * on the media graph thread, to ensure graph changes can be processed without
 * interfering with media processing. All interaction with the media graph
 * thread is done with message passing.
 *
 * APIs that modify the graph or its properties are described as "control APIs".
 * These APIs are asynchronous; they queue graph changes internally and
 * those changes are processed all-at-once by the MediaTrackGraph. The
 * MediaTrackGraph monitors the main thread event loop via
 * nsIAppShell::RunInStableState to ensure that graph changes from a single
 * event loop task are always processed all together. Control APIs should only
 * be used on the main thread, currently; we may be able to relax that later.
 *
 * To allow precise synchronization of times in the control API, the
 * MediaTrackGraph maintains a "media timeline". Control APIs that take or
 * return times use that timeline. Those times never advance during
 * an event loop task. This time is returned by
 * MediaTrackGraph::GetCurrentTime().
 *
 * Media decoding, audio processing and media playback use thread-safe APIs to
 * the media graph to ensure they can continue while the main thread is blocked.
 *
 * When the graph is changed, we may need to throw out buffered data and
 * reprocess it. This is triggered automatically by the MediaTrackGraph.

/**
 * A track of audio or video data. The media type must be known at construction
 * and cannot change. All tracks progress at the same rate --- "real time".
 * Tracks cannot seek. The only operation readers can perform on a track is to
 * read the next data.
 *
 * Consumers of a track can be reading from it at different offsets, but that
 * should only happen due to the order in which consumers are being run.
 * Those offsets must not diverge in the long term, otherwise we would require
 * unbounded buffering.
 *
 * (DEPRECATED to be removed in bug 1581074)
 * Tracks can be in a "blocked" state. While blocked, a track does not
 * produce data. A track can be explicitly blocked via the control API,
 * or implicitly blocked by whatever's generating it (e.g. an underrun in the
 * source resource), or implicitly blocked because something consuming it
 * blocks, or implicitly because it has ended.
 *
 * A track can be in an "ended" state. "Ended" tracks are permanently blocked.
 * The "ended" state is terminal.
 *
 * Transitions into and out of the "blocked" and "ended" states are managed
 * by the MediaTrackGraph on the media graph thread.
 *
 * We buffer media data ahead of the consumers' reading offsets. It is possible
 * to have buffered data but still be blocked.
 *
 * Any track can have its audio or video playing when requested. The media
 * track graph plays audio by constructing audio output tracks as necessary.
 * Video is played through a DirectMediaTrackListener managed by
 * VideoStreamTrack.
 *
 * The data in a track is managed by mSegment. The segment starts at GraphTime
 * mStartTime and encodes its own TrackTime duration.
 *
 * Tracks are explicitly managed. The client creates them via
 * MediaTrackGraph::Create{Source|ForwardedInput}Track, and releases them by
 * calling Destroy() when no longer needed (actual destruction will be
 * deferred). The actual object is owned by the MediaTrackGraph. The basic idea
 * is that main thread objects will keep Tracks alive as long as necessary
 * (using the cycle collector to clean up whenever needed).
 *
 * We make them refcounted only so that track-related messages with
 * MediaTrack* pointers can be sent to the main thread safely.
 *
 * The lifetimes of MediaTracks are controlled from the main thread.
 * For MediaTracks exposed to the DOM, the lifetime is controlled by the DOM
 * wrapper; the DOM wrappers own their associated MediaTracks. When a DOM
 * wrapper is destroyed, it sends a Destroy message for the associated
 * MediaTrack and clears its reference (the last main-thread reference to
 * the object). When the Destroy message is processed on the graph thread we
 * immediately release the affected objects (disentangling them from other
 * objects as necessary).
 *
 * This could cause problems for media processing if a MediaTrack is destroyed
 * while a downstream MediaTrack is still using it. Therefore the DOM wrappers
 * must keep upstream MediaTracks alive as long as they could be used in the
 * media graph.
 *
 * At any time, however, a set of MediaTrack wrappers could be collected via
 * cycle collection. Destroy messages will be sent for those objects in
 * arbitrary order and the MediaTrackGraph has to be able to handle this.
