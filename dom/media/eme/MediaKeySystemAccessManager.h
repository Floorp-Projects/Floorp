/**
 * MediaKeySystemAccessManager implements the functionality for
 * Navigator.requestMediaKeySystemAccess(). The navigator may perform its own
 * logic before passing the request to this class, but the majority of
 * processing happens the MediaKeySystemAccessManager. The manager is expected
 * to be run entirely on the main thread of the content process for whichever
 * window it is associated with.
 *
 * As well as implementing the Navigator.requestMediaKeySystemAccess()
 * algorithm, the manager performs Gecko specific logic. For example, the EME
 * specification does not specify a process to check if a CDM is installed as
 * part of requesting access, but that is an important part of obtaining access
 * for Gecko, and is handled by the manager.
 *
 * A request made to the manager can be thought of as entering a pipeline.
 * In this pipeline the request must pass through various stages that can
 * reject the request and remove it from the pipeline. If a request is not
 * rejected by the end of the pipeline it is approved/resolved.
 *
 * The pipeline is structured in such a way that each step should be executed
 * even if it will quickly be exited. For example, the step that checks if a
 * window supports protected media is an instant approve on non-Windows OSes,
 * but we want to execute the function representing that step to ensure a
 * deterministic execution and logging path. The hope is this reduces
 * complexity for when we need to debug or change the code.
 *
 * While the pipeline metaphor generally holds, the implementation details of
 * the manager mean that processing is not always linear: a request may be
 * re-injected earlier into the pipeline for reprocessing. This can happen
 * if the request was pending some other operation, e.g. CDM install, after
 * which we wish to reprocess that request. However, we strive to keep it
 * as linear as possible.
 *
 * A high level version of the happy path pipeline is depicted below. If a
 * request were to fail any of the steps below it would be rejected and ejected
 * from the pipeline.
 *
