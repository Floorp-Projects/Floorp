/**
 * Media applications want fast, "on demand" random access to media data,
 * for pausing, seeking, etc. But we are primarily interested
 * in transporting media data using HTTP over the Internet, which has
 * high latency to open a connection, requires a new connection for every
 * seek, may not even support seeking on some connections (especially
 * live streams), and uses a push model --- data comes from the server
 * and you don't have much control over the rate. Also, transferring data
 * over the Internet can be slow and/or unpredictable, so we want to read
 * ahead to buffer and cache as much data as possible.
 *
 * The job of the media cache is to resolve this impedance mismatch.
 * The media cache reads data from Necko channels into file-backed storage,
 * and offers a random-access file-like API to the stream data
 * (MediaCacheStream). Along the way it solves several problems:
 * -- The cache intelligently reads ahead to prefetch data that may be
 * needed in the future
 * -- The size of the cache is bounded so that we don't fill up
 * storage with read-ahead data
 * -- Cache replacement is managed globally so that the most valuable
 * data (across all streams) is retained
 * -- The cache can suspend Necko channels temporarily when their data is
 * not wanted (yet)
 * -- The cache translates file-like seek requests to HTTP seeks,
 * including optimizations like not triggering a new seek if it would
 * be faster to just keep reading until we reach the seek point. The
 * "seek to EOF" idiom to determine file size is also handled efficiently
 * (seeking to EOF and then seeking back to the previous offset does not
 * trigger any Necko activity)
 * -- The cache also handles the case where the server does not support
 * seeking
 * -- Necko can only send data to the main thread, but MediaCacheStream
 * can distribute data to any thread
 * -- The cache exposes APIs so clients can detect what data is
 * currently held
 *
 * Note that although HTTP is the most important transport and we only
 * support transport-level seeking via HTTP byte-ranges, the media cache
 * works with any kind of Necko channels and provides random access to
 * cached data even for, e.g., FTP streams.
 *
 * The media cache is not persistent. It does not currently allow
 * data from one load to be used by other loads, either within the same
 * browser session or across browser sessions. The media cache file
 * is marked "delete on close" so it will automatically disappear in the
 * event of a browser crash or shutdown.
 *
 * The media cache is block-based. Streams are divided into blocks of a
 * fixed size (currently 4K) and we cache blocks. A single cache contains
 * blocks for all streams.
 *
 * The cache size is controlled by the media.cache_size preference
 * (which is in KB). The default size is 500MB.
 *
 * The replacement policy predicts a "time of next use" for each block
 * in the cache. When we need to free a block, the block with the latest
 * "time of next use" will be evicted. Blocks are divided into
 * different classes, each class having its own predictor:
 * FREE_BLOCK: these blocks are effectively infinitely far in the future;
 * a free block will always be chosen for replacement before other classes
 * of blocks.
 * METADATA_BLOCK: these are blocks that contain data that has been read
 * by the decoder in "metadata mode", e.g. while the decoder is searching
 * the stream during a seek operation. These blocks are managed with an
 * LRU policy; the "time of next use" is predicted to be as far in the
 * future as the last use was in the past.
 * PLAYED_BLOCK: these are blocks that have not been read in "metadata
 * mode", and contain data behind the current decoder read point. (They
 * may not actually have been read by the decoder, if the decoder seeked
 * forward.) These blocks are managed with an LRU policy except that we add
 * REPLAY_DELAY seconds of penalty to their predicted "time of next use",
 * to reflect the uncertainty about whether replay will actually happen
 * or not.
 * READAHEAD_BLOCK: these are blocks that have not been read in
 * "metadata mode" and that are entirely ahead of the current decoder
 * read point. (They may actually have been read by the decoder in the
 * past if the decoder has since seeked backward.) We predict the
 * time of next use for these blocks by assuming steady playback and
 * dividing the number of bytes between the block and the current decoder
 * read point by the decoder's estimate of its playback rate in bytes
 * per second. This ensures that the blocks farthest ahead are considered
 * least valuable.
 * For efficient prediction of the "latest time of next use", we maintain
 * linked lists of blocks in each class, ordering blocks by time of
 * next use. READAHEAD_BLOCKS have one linked list per stream, since their
 * time of next use depends on stream parameters, but the other lists
 * are global.
 *
 * A block containing a current decoder read point can contain data
 * both behind and ahead of the read point. It will be classified as a
 * PLAYED_BLOCK but we will give it special treatment so it is never
 * evicted --- it actually contains the highest-priority readahead data
 * as well as played data.
 *
 * "Time of next use" estimates are also used for flow control. When
 * reading ahead we can predict the time of next use for the data that
 * will be read. If the predicted time of next use is later then the
 * prediction for all currently cached blocks, and the cache is full, then
 * we should suspend reading from the Necko channel.
 *
 * Unfortunately suspending the Necko channel can't immediately stop the
 * flow of data from the server. First our desire to suspend has to be
 * transmitted to the server (in practice, Necko stops reading from the
 * socket, which causes the kernel to shrink its advertised TCP receive
 * window size to zero). Then the server can stop sending the data, but
 * we will receive data roughly corresponding to the product of the link
 * bandwidth multiplied by the round-trip latency. We deal with this by
 * letting the cache overflow temporarily and then trimming it back by
 * moving overflowing blocks back into the body of the cache, replacing
 * less valuable blocks as they become available. We try to avoid simply
 * discarding overflowing readahead data.
 *
 * All changes to the actual contents of the cache happen on the main
 * thread, since that's where Necko's notifications happen.
 *
 * The media cache maintains at most one Necko channel for each stream.
 * (In the future it might be advantageous to relax this, e.g. so that a
 * seek to near the end of the file can happen without disturbing
 * the loading of data from the beginning of the file.) The Necko channel
 * is managed through ChannelMediaResource; MediaCache does not
 * depend on Necko directly.
 *
 * Every time something changes that might affect whether we want to
 * read from a Necko channel, or whether we want to seek on the Necko
 * channel --- such as data arriving or data being consumed by the
 * decoder --- we asynchronously trigger MediaCache::Update on the main
 * thread. That method implements most cache policy. It evaluates for
 * each stream whether we want to suspend or resume the stream and what
 * offset we should seek to, if any. It is also responsible for trimming
 * back the cache size to its desired limit by moving overflowing blocks
 * into the main part of the cache.
 *
 * Streams can be opened in non-seekable mode. In non-seekable mode,
 * the cache will only call ChannelMediaResource::CacheClientSeek with
 * a 0 offset. The cache tries hard not to discard readahead data
 * for non-seekable streams, since that could trigger a potentially
 * disastrous re-read of the entire stream. It's up to cache clients
 * to try to avoid requesting seeks on such streams.
 *
 * MediaCache has a single internal monitor for all synchronization.
 * This is treated as the lowest level monitor in the media code. So,
 * we must not acquire any MediaDecoder locks or MediaResource locks
 * while holding the MediaCache lock. But it's OK to hold those locks
 * and then get the MediaCache lock.
 *
 * MediaCache associates a principal with each stream. CacheClientSeek
 * can trigger new HTTP requests; due to redirects to other domains,
 * each HTTP load can return data with a different principal. This
 * principal must be passed to NotifyDataReceived, and MediaCache
 * will detect when different principals are associated with data in the
 * same stream, and replace them with a null principal.
