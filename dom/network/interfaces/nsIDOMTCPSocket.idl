// Bug 731746 - Allow chrome JS object to implement nsIDOMEventTarget
// nsITCPSocket should be an nsIEventTarget but js objects
// cannot be an nsIEventTarget yet
// #include "nsIEventTarget.idl"

// Bug 723206 - Constructors implemented in JS from IDL should be
//              allowed to have arguments
//
//  Once bug 723206 will be fixed, this method could be replaced by
//  arguments when instantiating a TCPSocket object. For example it will
//  be possible to do (similarly to the WebSocket API):
//    var s = new MozTCPSocket(host, port);
