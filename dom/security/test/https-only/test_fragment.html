<title>Bug 1694932: Https-only mode reloads the page in certain cases when there should be just a fragment navigation </title>

/*
 * Description of the test:
 * Perform a test where a button click leads to scroll the page. Test if https-only detects
 * that the redirection address of the button is on the same page. Instead of a reload https-only
 * should only scroll.
 *
 * Test:
 * Enable https-only and load the url
 * Load: http://mozilla.pettay.fi/moztests/fragment.html
 * Click "Click me"
 * The page should be  scrolled down to 'foo' without a reload
 * It shouldn't receive a message 'before unload' because the on before unload
 *  function in file_fragment.html should not be called
