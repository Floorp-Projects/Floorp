/*
 * Description of the test:
 * We perform each test with 4 different cookie settings and
 * expect https-first to detect which cookie is same origin and
 * which is cross origin. The cookies are in an image or in a frame.
 * The 4 cookie settings differ in two flags which are set or not.
 * The first call is always with secure flag not set and sameSite=none
 * In the second call we don't set the secure flag but sameSite=strict
 * In the third call we set the secure flag and sameSite=none
 * In the forth call we set the secure flag and sameSite=strict
 * More detailed:
 * We run the tests in the following order.
 * Test 1a: Image is loaded with cookie same-origin, not secure and sameSite=none
 * Test 1b: Image is loaded with cookie same-origin, not secure and sameSite=strict
 * Test 1c: Image is loaded with cookie same-origin, secure and sameSite=none
 * Test 1d: Image is loaded with cookie same-origin, secure and sameSite=strict
 * Test 1e: Image is loaded with cookie cross-origin, not secure and sameSite=none
 * Test 1f: Image is loaded with cookie cross-origin, not secure and sameSite=strict
 * Test 2a: Load frame navigation with cookie same-origin, not secure and sameSite=none
 * ...
 * Test 3a: Load frame navigation blank with cookie same-origin, not secure and sameSite=none
 * ...
 * Test 4a: Load frame Inc with cookie same-origin, not secure and sameSite=none
 * ...
 * Test 5a: Load frame Inc Blank with cookie same-origin, not secure and sameSite=none
 * ...
