/**
 * Effectively just a refcounted life-cycle management wrapper around
 * LSObserverChild which exists to receive "storage" event information from
 * other processes.  (Same-process events are handled within the process, see
 * `LSObject::OnChange`.)
 *
 * ## Lifecycle ##
 * - Created by LSObject::EnsureObserver via synchronous LSRequest idiom
 *   whenever the first window's origin adds a "storage" event.  Placed in the
 *   gLSObservers LSObserverHashtable for subsequent LSObject's via
 *   LSObserver::Get lookup.
 * - The LSObserverChild directly handles "Observe" messages, shunting them
 *   directly to Storage::NotifyChange which does all the legwork of notifying
 *   windows about "storage" events.
 * - Destroyed when refcount goes to zero due to all owning LSObjects being
 *   destroyed or having their `LSObject::DropObserver` methods invoked due to
 *   the last "storage" event listener being removed from the owning window.
