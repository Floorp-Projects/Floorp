  // SendMailMessage requires the file name of the message to send, the
  // sender, a comma delimited list of recipients.
  // It builds an Smtp url, makes an smtp connection and runs the url. If you
  // want a handle on the running task, pass in  a valid nsIURI ptr. You can
  // later interrupt this action by asking the netlib service manager to
  // interrupt the url you are given back. Remember to release aURL when you
  // are done with it. Pass nsnull in for aURL if you don't care about 
  // the returned URL.
  //
  // If you don't care about listening to the url, feel free to pass in
  // nsnull for that argument.
  //
  // You can also pass an SMTP server as an argument if you want to send
  // this message with a specific server.. otherwise it will use the
  // default server
