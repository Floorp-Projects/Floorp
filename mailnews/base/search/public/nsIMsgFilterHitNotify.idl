///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// nsIMsgFilterHitNotify is an interface designed to make evaluating filters
// easier. Clients typically open a filter list and ask the filter list to
// evaluate the filters for a particular message, and pass in an
// interface pointer to be notified of hits. The filter list will call the
// ApplyFilterHit method on the interface pointer in case of hits, along with
// the desired action and value.
// return value is used to indicate whether the
// filter list should continue trying to apply filters or not.
