 * The nsICachedNetData interface represents a single entry in a database that
 * caches data retrieved from the network. This interface is implemented by the
 * cache manager on top of the low-level nsINetDataCacheRecord and
 * nsINetDataCache interfaces that are implemented by the database.
 *
 * Each cache record may contain both content and metadata.  The content may
 * be, for example, GIF image data or HTML, and it is accessed through
 * nsIChannel's streaming API.  The opaque metadata, which may contain HTTP
 * headers among other things, is stored as a byte array.  Each entry in the
 * cache is indexed by two different keys: a record id number and a key created
 * by combining the URI with a "secondary key", e.g. HTTP post data.
