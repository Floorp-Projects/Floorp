 * channels, like nsIHttpChannel and nsIWebSocket, which implement the
 * nsIHttpAuthenticableChannel interface.
 *
 * When requesting pages AddAuthorizationHeaders MUST be called
 * in order to get the http cached headers credentials. When the request is
 * unsuccessful because of receiving either a 401 or 407 http response code
 * ProcessAuthentication MUST be called and the page MUST be requested again
 * with the new credentials that the user has provided. After a successful
 * request, checkForSuperfluousAuth MAY be called, and disconnect MUST be
 * called.
