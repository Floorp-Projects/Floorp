/*
 * WebTransportSessionProxy is introduced to enable the creation of a
 * Http3WebTransportSession and coordination of actions that are performed on
 * the main thread and on the socket thread.
 *
 * mChannel, mRedirectChannel, and mListener are used only on the main thread.
 *
 * mWebTransportSession is used only on the socket thread.
 *
 * mState and mSessionId are used on both threads, socket and main thread and it
 * is only used with a lock.
 *
 *
 * WebTransportSessionProxyState:
 * - INIT: before AsyncConnect is called.
 *
 * - NEGOTIATING: It is set during AsyncConnect. During this state HttpChannel
 *   is open but OnStartRequest has not been called yet. This state can
 *   transfer into:
 *    - NEGOTIATING_SUCCEEDED: when a Http3WebTransportSession has been
 *      negotiated.
 *    - DONE: when a WebTransport session has been canceled.
 *
 * - NEGOTIATING_SUCCEEDED: It is set during parsing of
 *   Http3WebTransportSession response when the response has been successful.
 *   mWebTransport is set to the Http3WebTransportSession at the same time the
 *   session changes to this state. This state can transfer into:
 *    - ACTIVE: during the OnStopRequest call if the WebTransport has not been
 *      canceled or failed for other reason, e.g. a browser shutdown or content
 *      blocking policies.
 *    - SESSION_CLOSE_PENDING: if the WebTransport has been canceled via an API
 *      call or content blocking policies. (the main thread initiated close).
 *    - CLOSE_CALLBACK_PENDING: if Http3WebTransportSession has been canceled
 *     due to a shutdown or a server closing a session. (the socket thread
 *     initiated close).
 *
 * - ACTIVE: In this state the session is negotiated and ready to use. This
 *   state can transfer into:
 *    - SESSION_CLOSE_PENDING: if the WebTransport has been canceled via an API
 *      call(nsIWebTransport::closeSession) or content blocking policies. (the
 *      main thread initiated close).
 *    - CLOSE_CALLBACK_PENDING: if Http3WebTransportSession has been canceled
 *      due to a shutdown or a server closing a session. (the socket thread
 *      initiated close).
 *
 * - CLOSE_CALLBACK_PENDING: This is the socket thread initiated close. In this
 *   state, the Http3WebTransportSession has been closed and a
 * CallOnSessionClosed call is dispatched to the main thread to call the
 * appropriate listener.
 *
 * - SESSION_CLOSE_PENDING: This is the main thread initiated close. In this
 * state, the WebTransport has been closed via an API call
 *   (nsIWebTransport::closeSession) and a CloseSessionInternal call is
 * dispatched to the socket thread to close the appropriate
 * Http3WebTransportSession.
 *
 * - DONE: everything has been cleaned up on both threads.
 *
 *
 * AsyncConnect creates mChannel on the main thread. Redirect callbacks are also
 * performed on the main thread (mRedirectChannel set and access only on the
 * main thread). Before this point, there are no activities on the socket thread
 * and Http3WebTransportSession is nullptr. mChannel is going to create a
 * nsHttpTransaction. The transaction will be dispatched on a nsAHttpConnection,
 * i.e. currently only the HTTP/3 version is implemented, therefore this will be
 * a HttpConnectionUDP and a Http3Session. The Http3Session creates a
 * Http3WebTransportSession. Until a response is received
 * Http3WebTransportSession is only accessed by Http3Session. During parsing of
 * a successful received from a server on the socket thread,
 * WebTransportSessionProxy::mWebTransportSession will take a reference to
 * Http3WebTransportSession and mState will be set to NEGOTIATING_SUCCEEDED.
 * From now on WebTransportSessionProxy is responsible for closing
 * Http3WebTransportSession if the closing of the session is initiated on the
 * main thread. OnStartRequest and OnStopRequest will be called on the main
 * thread. The session negotiation can have 2 outcomes:
 * - If both calls, i.e. OnStartRequest an OnStopRequest, indicate that the
 * request has succeeded and mState is NEGOTIATING_SUCCEEDED, the
 * mListener->OnSessionReady will be called during OnStopRequest.
 * - Otherwise, mListener->OnSessionClosed will be called, the state transferred
 * into SESSION_CLOSE_PENDING, and CloseSessionInternal will be dispatched to
 * the socket thread.
 *
 * CloseSession is called on the main thread. If the session is already closed
 * it returns an error. If the session is in state NEGOTIATING or
 * NEGOTIATING_SUCCEEDED mChannel will be canceled. If the session is in state
 * NEGOTIATING_SUCCEEDED or ACTIVE the state transferred into
 * SESSION_CLOSE_PENDING, and CloseSessionInternal will be dispatched to the
 * socket thread
 *
 * OnSessionReadyInternal is called on the socket thread. If mState is
 * NEGOTIATING the state will be set to NEGOTIATING_SUCCEEDED and mWebTransport
 * will be set to the newly negotiated Http3WebTransportSession. If mState is
 * DONE, the Http3WebTransportSession will be close.
 *
 * OnSessionClosed is called on the socket thread. mState will be set to
 * CLOSE_CALLBACK_PENDING and CallOnSessionClosed will be dispatched to the main
 * thread.
 *
 * mWebTransport is set during states NEGOTIATING_SUCCEEDED, ACTIVE and
 * SESSION_CLOSE_PENDING.
