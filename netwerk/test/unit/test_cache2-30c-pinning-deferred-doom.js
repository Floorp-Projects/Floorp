/*

This is a complex test checking the internal "deferred doom" functionality in both CacheEntry and CacheFileHandle.

- We create a batch of 10 non-pinned and 10 pinned entries, write something to them.
- Then we purge them from memory, so they have to reload from disk.
- After that the IO thread is suspended not to process events on the READ (3) level.  This forces opening operation and eviction
  sync operations happen before we know actual pinning status of already cached entries.
- We async-open the same batch of the 10+10 entries again, all should open as existing with the expected, previously stored
  content
- After all these entries are made to open, we clear the cache.  This does some synchronous operations on the entries
  being open and also on the handles being in an already open state (but before the entry metadata has started to be read.)
  Expected is to leave the pinned entries only.
- Now, we resume the IO thread, so it start reading.  One could say this is a hack, but this can very well happen in reality
  on slow disk or when a large number of entries is about to be open at once.  Suspending the IO thread is just doing this
  simulation is a fully deterministic way and actually very easily and elegantly.
- After the resume we want to open all those 10+10 entries once again (no purgin involved this time.).  It is expected
  to open all the pinning entries intact and loose all the non-pinned entries (get them as new and empty again.)
