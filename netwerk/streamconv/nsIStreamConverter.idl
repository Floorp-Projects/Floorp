/**
 * nsIStreamConverter provides an interface to implement when you have code
 * that converts data from one type to another.
 *
 * Suppose you had code that converted plain text into HTML. You could implement
 * this interface to allow everyone else to use your conversion logic using a
 * standard api.
 * <p>
 * <b>STREAM CONVERTER USERS</b>
 *
 * There are currently two ways to use a stream converter:
 * <ol>
 * <li> <b>SYNCHRONOUS</b> Stream to Stream
 *    You can supply the service with a stream of type X
 *    and it will convert it to your desired output type and return
 *    a converted (blocking) stream to you.</li>
 *
 * <li> <b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> nsIStreamListener to nsIStreamListener
 *    You can supply data directly to the converter by calling it's
 *    nsIStreamListener::OnDataAvailable() method. It will then
 *    convert that data from type X to your desired output type and
 *    return converted data to you via the nsIStreamListener you passed
 *    in by calling its OnDataAvailable() method.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>STREAM CONVERTER SUPPLIERS</b>
 *
 * Registering a stream converter:
 * Stream converter registration is a two step process. First of all the stream
 * converter implementation must register itself with the component manager using
 * a contractid in the format below. Second, the stream converter must add the contractid
 * to the registry.
 *
 * Stream converter contractid format (the stream converter root key is defined in this
 * file):
