# Neqo Triage Guideline

[Neqo](https://github.com/mozilla/neqo/issues) has p1, p2, and p3 labels that correspond to the following Bugzilla labels:
- p1 - the issue should be fixed as soon as possible because it is a defect or a fix has been planned for a project.
  - This is P1 and P2 in Bugzilla.
- p2 - the issue should be fixed but they are not critical, an issue can be in this state for a longer time.
  - This is P3 in Bugzilla
- p3 - we are not planning to fix the issue.
  - This contains 2 sets of issues:
    - we would take a fix if someone wants to work on it or
    - we may not want to fix the issue at all at this time
  - This is P5 in Bugzilla
