/**
 * nsICookieService
 *
 * Provides methods for setting and getting cookies in the context of a
 * page load.  See nsICookieManager for methods to manipulate the cookie
 * database directly.  This separation of interface is mainly historical.
 *
 * This service broadcasts the notifications detailed below when the cookie
 * list is changed, or a cookie is rejected.
 *
 * NOTE: observers of these notifications *must* not attempt to change profile
 *       or switch into or out of private browsing mode from within the
 *       observer. Doing so will cause undefined behavior. Mutating the cookie
 *       list (e.g. by calling methods on nsICookieService and friends) is
 *       allowed, but beware that there may be pending notifications you haven't
 *       seen yet -- for instance, a "batch-deleted" notification will likely be
 *       immediately followed by "added". You may check the state of the cookie
 *       list to determine if this is the case.
 *
 * topic  : "cookie-changed"
 *          broadcast whenever the cookie list changes in some way. see
 *          explanation of data strings below.
 * subject: see below.
 * data   : "deleted"
 *          a cookie was deleted. the subject is an nsICookie representing
 *          the deleted cookie.
 *          "added"
 *          a cookie was added. the subject is an nsICookie representing
 *          the added cookie.
 *          "changed"
 *          a cookie was changed. the subject is an nsICookie representing
 *          the new cookie. (note that host, path, and name are invariant
 *          for a given cookie; other parameters may change.)
 *          "batch-deleted"
 *          a set of cookies was purged (typically, because they have either
 *          expired or because the cookie list has grown too large). The subject
 *          is an nsIArray of nsICookie's representing the deleted cookies.
 *          Note that the array could contain a single cookie.
 *          "cleared"
 *          the entire cookie list was cleared. the subject is null.
 *
 * topic  : "cookie-rejected"
 *          broadcast whenever a cookie was rejected from being set as a
 *          result of user prefs.
 * subject: an nsIURI interface pointer representing the URI that attempted
 *          to set the cookie.
 * data   : none.
