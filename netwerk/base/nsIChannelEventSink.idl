    /**
     * Called when a redirect occurs. This may happen due to an HTTP 3xx status
     * code. The purpose of this method is to notify the sink that a redirect
     * is about to happen, but also to give the sink the right to veto the
     * redirect by throwing or passing a failure-code in the callback.
     *
     * Note that vetoing the redirect simply means that |newChannel| will not
     * be opened. It is important to understand that |oldChannel| will continue
     * loading as if it received a HTTP 200, which includes notifying observers
     * and possibly display or process content attached to the HTTP response.
     * If the sink wants to prevent this loading it must explicitly deal with
     * it, e.g. by calling |oldChannel->Cancel()|
     *
     * There is a certain freedom in implementing this method:
     *
     * If the return-value indicates success, a callback on |callback| is
     * required. This callback can be done from within asyncOnChannelRedirect
     * (effectively making the call synchronous) or at some point later
     * (making the call asynchronous). Repeat: A callback must be done
     * if this method returns successfully.
     *
     * If the return value indicates error (method throws an exception)
     * the redirect is vetoed and no callback must be done. Repeat: No
     * callback must be done if this method throws!
     *
     * NOTE: originalURI isn't yet set on the new channel when
     * asyncOnChannelRedirect is called.
