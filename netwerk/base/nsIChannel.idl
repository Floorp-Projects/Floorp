/**
 * The nsIChannel interface allows clients to construct "GET" requests for
 * specific protocols, and manage them in a uniform way.  Once a channel is
 * created (via nsIIOService::newChannel), parameters for that request may
 * be set by using the channel attributes, or by QI'ing to a subclass of
 * nsIChannel for protocol-specific parameters.  Then, the URI can be fetched
 * by calling nsIChannel::open or nsIChannel::asyncOpen.
 *
 * After a request has been completed, the channel is still valid for accessing
 * protocol-specific results.  For example, QI'ing to nsIHttpChannel allows
 * response headers to be retrieved for the corresponding http transaction.
 *
 * This interface must be used only from the XPCOM main thread.
