/**
 * The nsIChannel interface allows the user to construct get requests for
 * specific protocols, and manage them in a uniform way. Once a channel
 * is created (via nsIIOService::NewChannel), parameters for that request
 * may be set by using the channel attributes, or by QueryInterfacing to a
 * subclass of nsIChannel for protocol-specific parameters. Then the actual
 * request can be issued in one of several ways:
 *
 *      - AsyncOpen is used for asynchronous reading, calling back the
 *        user's stream listener.
 *      - Open is used for synchronous read on the underlying channel.
 *
 * After a request has been completed, the channel is still valid for
 * accessing protocol-specific results. For example, QueryInterfacing to 
 * nsIHTTPChannel allows response headers to be retrieved that result from
 * http transactions.
