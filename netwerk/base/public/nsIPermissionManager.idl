 *          broadcast whenever the permission list changes in some way. there
 *          are four possible data strings for this notification; one

 * data   : "deleted"
 *          a permission was deleted. the subject is the deleted permission.
 *          "added"
 *          a permission was added. the subject is the added permission.
