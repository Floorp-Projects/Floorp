 * URIs are essentially structured names for things -- anything.

 *
 *     http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URI/URI_Overview.html
 *  
 * essentially:
 *  
 *      ftp://username:password@hostname:portnumber/pathname
 *      \ /   \               / \      / \        /\       /
 *       -     ---------------   ------   --------  -------
 *       |            |             |        |         |
 *       |            |             |        |        Path
 *       |            |             |       Port

 *       |         PreHost            
 *     Scheme
 *
 * The subclass nsIURL provides a means to open an input or output              
 * stream to a URI as a source/destination, as well as providing additional     
 * accessors to destructure the path, query and reference portions typically    
 * associated with URLs.
