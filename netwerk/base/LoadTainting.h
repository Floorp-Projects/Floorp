// Define an enumeration to reflect the concept of response tainting from the
// the fetch spec:
//
//  https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-response-tainting
//
// Roughly the tainting means:
//
//  * Basic: the request resulted in a same-origin or non-http load
//  * CORS: the request resulted in a cross-origin load with CORS headers
//  * Opaque: the request resulted in a cross-origin load without CORS headers
//
// The enumeration is purposefully designed such that more restrictive tainting
// corresponds to a higher integral value.
//
// NOTE: Checking the tainting is not currently adequate.  You *must* still
//       check the final URL and CORS mode on the channel.
//
// These values are currently only set on the channel LoadInfo when the request
// was initiated through fetch() or when a service worker interception occurs.
// In the future we should set the tainting value within necko so that it is
// consistently applied.  Once that is done consumers can replace checks against
// the final URL and CORS mode with checks against tainting.
