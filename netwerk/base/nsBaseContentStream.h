//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// nsBaseContentStream is designed to be subclassed with the intention of being
// used to satisfy the nsBaseChannel::OpenContentStream method.
//
// The subclass typically overrides the default Available, ReadSegments and
// CloseWithStatus methods.  By default, Read is implemented in terms of
// ReadSegments, and Close is implemented in terms of CloseWithStatus.  If
// CloseWithStatus is overriden, then the subclass will usually want to call
// the base class' CloseWithStatus method before returning.
//
// If the stream is non-blocking, then readSegments may return the exception
// NS_BASE_STREAM_WOULD_BLOCK if there is no data available and the stream is
// not at the "end-of-file" or already closed.  This error code must not be
// returned from the Available implementation.  When the caller receives this
// error code, he may choose to call the stream's AsyncWait method, in which
// case the base stream will have a non-null PendingCallback.  When the stream
// has data or encounters an error, it should be sure to dispatch a pending
// callback if one exists (see DispatchCallback).  The implementation of the
// base stream's CloseWithStatus (and Close) method will ensure that any
// pending callback is dispatched.  It is the responsibility of the subclass
// to ensure that the pending callback is dispatched when it wants to have its
// ReadSegments method called again.
