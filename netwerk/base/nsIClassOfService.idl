/**
 * nsIClassOfService.idl
 *
 * Used to express class dependencies and characteristics - complimentary to
 * nsISupportsPriority which is used to express weight
 *
 * Channels that implement this interface may make use of this
 * information in different ways.
 *
 * The default gecko HTTP/1 stack makes Followers wait for Leaders to
 * complete before dispatching followers. Other classes run in
 * parallel - neither being blocked nor blocking. All grouping is done
 * based on the Load Group - separate load groups proceed
 * independently.
 *
 * HTTP/2 does not use the load group, but prioritization is done per
 * HTTP/2 session. HTTP/2 dispatches all the requests as soon as
 * possible.
 * The various classes are assigned logical priority
 * dependency groups and then transactions of that class depend on the
 * group. In this model Followers block on Leaders and Speculative
 * depends on Background. See Http2Stream.cpp for weighting details.
