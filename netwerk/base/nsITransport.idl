/**
 * nsITransport
 *
 * This interface provides a common way of accessing i/o streams connected
 * to some resource.  This interface does not in any way specify the resource.
 * It provides methods to open blocking or non-blocking, buffered or unbuffered
 * streams to the resource.  The name "transport" is meant to connote the
 * inherent data transfer implied by this interface (i.e., data is being
 * transfered in some fashion via the streams exposed by this interface).
 *
 * A transport can have an event sink associated with it.  The event sink
 * receives transport-specific events as the transfer is occuring.  For a
 * socket transport, these events can include status about the connection.
 * See nsISocketTransport for more info about socket transport specifics.
