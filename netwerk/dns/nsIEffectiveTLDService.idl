     * Returns the public suffix of a URI. A public suffix is the highest-level domain
     * under which individual domains may be registered; it may therefore contain one
     * or more dots. For example, the public suffix for "www.bbc.co.uk" is "co.uk",
     * because the .uk TLD does not allow the registration of domains at the
     * second level ("bbc.uk" is forbidden).
     *
     * The public suffix will be returned encoded in ASCII/ACE and will be normalized
     * according to RFC 3454, i.e. the same encoding returned by nsIURI::GetAsciiHost().
     * If consumers wish to compare the result of this method against the host from
     * another nsIURI, the host should be obtained using nsIURI::GetAsciiHost().
     * In the case of nested URIs, the innermost URI will be used.
