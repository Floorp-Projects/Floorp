     * according to RFC 3454, i.e. the same encoding returned by nsIURI::GetAsciiHost().
     * If consumers wish to compare the result of this method against the host from
     * another nsIURI, the host should be obtained using nsIURI::GetAsciiHost().
     * In the case of nested URIs, the innermost URI will be used.
