 Assumptions:

 The object associated with object or anchor index
 is an nsIAccessible.
 A URI can be represented by the nsIURI interface
 (or nsIURL interface).

 Note that an object which supports nsIAccessibleHyperlink
 does *not* generally implement nsIAccessible, unlike the
    case of the other nsiAccessible* interfaces in this directory.

    Aaron: would the nsISupports return from
    getObject be queryable for nsIURI and nsIURL directly?
