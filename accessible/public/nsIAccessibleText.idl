 Assumptions:

 Using wstring (UCS2) instead of string encoded in UTF-8.
 Multibyte encodings (or at least potentially multi-byte
 encodings) would be preferred for the reasons cited above.

 The following methods will throw an exception on failure
 (since not every text component will allow every operation):
 setSelectionBounds, addSelection, removeSelection, setCaretOffset.

 we assume that all text components support the idea of
 a caret offset, whether visible or "virtual".  If this
 isn't the case, caretOffset can be made readonly and
 a setCaretOffset method provided which throws an exception
 on failure (as with *selection methods above).
