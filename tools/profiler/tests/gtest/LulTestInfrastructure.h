// Derived from:
// cfi_assembler.h: Define CFISection, a class for creating properly
// (and improperly) formatted DWARF CFI data for unit tests.

// Derived from:
// test-assembler.h: interface to class for building complex binary streams.

// To test the Breakpad symbol dumper and processor thoroughly, for
// all combinations of host system and minidump processor
// architecture, we need to be able to easily generate complex test
// data like debugging information and minidump files.
//
// For example, if we want our unit tests to provide full code
// coverage for stack walking, it may be difficult to persuade the
// compiler to generate every possible sort of stack walking
// information that we want to support; there are probably DWARF CFI
// opcodes that GCC never emits. Similarly, if we want to test our
// error handling, we will need to generate damaged minidumps or
// debugging information that (we hope) the client or compiler will
// never produce on its own.
//
// google_breakpad::TestAssembler provides a predictable and
// (relatively) simple way to generate complex formatted data streams
// like minidumps and CFI. Furthermore, because TestAssembler is
// portable, developers without access to (say) Visual Studio or a
// SPARC assembler can still work on test data for those targets.

// A Label represents a value not yet known that we need to store in a
// section. As long as all the labels a section refers to are defined
// by the time we retrieve its contents as bytes, we can use undefined
// labels freely in that section's construction.
//
// A label can be in one of three states:
// - undefined,
// - defined as the sum of some other label and a constant, or
// - a constant.
//
// A label's value never changes, but it can accumulate constraints.
// Adding labels and integers is permitted, and yields a label.
// Subtracting a constant from a label is permitted, and also yields a
// label. Subtracting two labels that have some relationship to each
// other is permitted, and yields a constant.
//
// For example:
//
//   Label a;               // a's value is undefined
//   Label b;               // b's value is undefined
//   {
//     Label c = a + 4;     // okay, even though a's value is unknown
//     b = c + 4;           // also okay; b is now a+8
//   }
//   Label d = b - 2;       // okay; d == a+6, even though c is gone
//   d.Value();             // error: d's value is not yet known
//   d - a;                 // is 6, even though their values are not known
//   a = 12;                // now b == 20, and d == 18
//   d.Value();             // 18: no longer an error
//   b.Value();             // 20
//   d = 10;                // error: d is already defined.
//
// Label objects' lifetimes are unconstrained: notice that, in the
// above example, even though a and b are only related through c, and
// c goes out of scope, the assignment to a sets b's value as well. In
// particular, it's not necessary to ensure that a Label lives beyond
// Sections that refer to it.
