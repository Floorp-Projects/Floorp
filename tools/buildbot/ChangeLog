2006-12-10  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): Releasing buildbot-0.7.5
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo: set version to match

2006-12-10  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* README (REQUIREMENTS): update for release
	* NEWS: update for release
	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (command_version): mention that this
	version (2.2) was released with buildbot-0.7.5

	* buildbot/test/test_config.py (StartService.testStartService):
	inhibit the usual read-config-on-startup behavior, since otherwise
	the log.err that gets recorded causes the test to fail

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (LogFile.finish): forget about all
	subscribers once the log has finished, since after that point
	we're never going to use them again. This might help free up some
	memory somewhere.

	* buildbot/clients/debug.py: update to use gtk.main_quit() rather
	than the old/deprecated gtk.mainquit()

2006-12-09  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/steps/transfer.py (_FileWriter.__del__): handle errors
	better when we can't open the masterdst file

	* buildbot/scripts/startup.py (Follower._failure): add missing
	import statement for BuildSlaveDetectedError

	* buildbot/steps/transfer.py (FileUpload): cleanup
	(FileDownload): same. Add tests for slave version, add mode=.
	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (SlaveFileUploadCommand): same
	(SlaveFileDownloadCommand): same
	* buildbot/test/test_transfer.py: enhance tests
	* buildbot/test/runutils.py (makeBuildStep): create a fake form of
	step.slaveVersion

2006-12-08  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (sendchange): halt the reactor on
	both success *and* failure. Without this, the 'buildbot
	sendchange' command would hang if it could not contact the
	buildmaster or deliver the Change, which would generally cause the
	user's commit/record/checkin command to hang too. Thanks to
	Christian Unger for the catch.

2006-12-06  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* NEWS: update with items for the next release

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Adding LogObservers): add a somewhat
	whimsical example pulled from a punch-drunk email I sent out late
	one night.
	(Transferring Files): document some of the other parameters
	(Adding LogObservers): update to 0.7.5 buildbot.steps.*
	(SVNPoller): rename svnpoller.SvnSource to SVNPoller
	* buildbot/test/test_svnpoller.py: same
	* buildbot/changes/svnpoller.py (SVNPoller): same

2006-11-26  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Build Properties): remind users that
	WithProperties must appear in a command= list, not as a top-level
	instance.
	* buildbot/steps/shell.py (ShellCommand.start): and assert that
	we're sending a list or a single string to the RemoteShellCommand

	* buildbot/scheduler.py (Nightly): Improve docs slightly.

	* buildbot/scripts/startup.py (start): skip the whole
	watch-the-logfile thing under windows, since it needs os.fork()

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (restart): remove the old message
	that got printed after the buildbot was restarted.. it most cases
	it didn't get printed at the right time anyways

2006-11-25  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py: enhance 'start' and 'restart' to
	follow twistd.log and print lines until the process has started
	started properly. For the buildmaster, this means until the config
	file has been parsed and accepted. For the buildslave, this means
	until we've connected to the master. We give up after 5 seconds in
	any case. Helpful error messages and troubleshooting suggestions
	are printed when we don't see a successful startup. This closes the
	remainder of SF#1517975.
	* buildbot/scripts/startup.py: moved app startup code to here
	* buildbot/scripts/logwatcher.py: utility class to follow log
	* buildbot/scripts/reconfig.py: rewrite to use LogWatcher
	* buildbot/slave/bot.py: announce our BuildSlaveness to the log
	so the LogWatcher can tell the difference between a buildmaster
	and a buildslave

2006-11-24  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: update to match the version
	in use on twistedmatrix.com
	(IRC): re-enable IRC bot. The 'irc.us.freenode.net' hostname I
	was using before stopped working, but 'irc.freenode.net' works
	just fine.

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (run): oops, forgot to enable the new
	'reconfig' command

	* buildbot/clients/base.py (TextClient.not_connected): upon
	UnauthorizedLogin failures, remind the user to connect to the
	PBListener port instead of the slaveport.
	(TextClient.disconnected): shut down more quietly
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (statuslog): add another reminder

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (Options.subCommands): rename
	'buildbot sighup DIR' to 'buildbot reconfig DIR', but keep
	'sighup' as an alias.
	* buildbot/scripts/reconfig.py (Reconfigurator): enhance the
	reconfig command to follow twistd.log and print all of the lines
	from the start of the config-file reload to its completion. This
	should make it a lot easier to discover bugs in the config file.
	Use --quiet to disable this behavior. This addresses half of
	SF#1517975, the other half will be to add this same utility to
	'buildbot start' and 'buildbot restart'.
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Loading the Config File): same
	(Shutdown): same

	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IBuilderControl.forceBuild): remove this
	method, it has been deprecated for a long time. Use
	IBuilderControl.requestBuild instead.
	* buildbot/process/builder.py (BuilderControl.forceBuild): remove
	* buildbot/master.py (BotPerspective.perspective_forceBuild): same
	* buildbot/slave/bot.py (Bot.debug_forceBuild): same
	* buildbot/test/test_control.py (Force.testForce): same
	* buildbot/test/test_run.py: use requestBuild instead

	* buildbot/clients/debug.py: replace 'Force Build' button with
	'Request Build' (which just adds one to the queue), add Ping
	Builder, add branch/revision fields to Request Build.
	* buildbot/clients/debug.glade: same
	* buildbot/master.py: update interface to match. This creates an
	incompatibility between new debugclients and old buildmasters.

	* buildbot/process/builder.py (Builder._attached): delay the call
	to maybeStartBuild for a reactor turn, to avoid starting a build
	in the middle of a reconfig (say, if the new Builder uses a new
	slave which is already connected).

2006-11-23  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_transfer.py: appease pyflakes
	* buildbot/test/test_steps.py: same

	* buildbot/test/test_bonsaipoller.py: remove the 'import *' that
	keeps pyflakes from finding undefined names

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadConfig_Builders): changing a
	Builder no longer induces a disconnect/reconnect cycle. This means
	that any builds currently in progress will not be interrupted, and
	any builds which are queued in the Builder will not be lost. This
	is implemented by having the new Builder extract the state (i.e.
	all pending Builds and any desired SlaveBuilders) from the old
	Builder.
	(BotPerspective): refactor. The BotPerspective no longer keeps
	track of all the Builders that want to use this slave; instead, it
	asks the BotMaster each time it needs this list. This removes
	addBuilder and removeBuilder. Clean up attached() to acquire all
	the slave's information in a more atomic fashion. updateSlave() is
	now the way to make sure the slave is using the right set of
	Builders: just call it after everything else has been
	reconfigured.
	(BotMaster): refactor, removing addBuilder/removeBuilder and
	replacing them with an all-at-once setBuilders() call.

	* buildbot/test/test_slaves.py (Reconfig): new test case to
	exercise this functionality
	* buildbot/steps/dummy.py (Wait): new dummy BuildStep for the test
	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (WaitCommand): same

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Loading the Config File): document the
	changes

	* buildbot/process/builder.py (SlaveBuilder): refactor. Allow the
	SlaveBuilder to have its parent Builder changed.
	(SlaveBuilder.isAvailable): new method to give access to state,
	which is now a private attribute
	(SlaveBuilder.buildStarted,buildFinished): new methods to inform
	the SlaveBuilder about how it is being used. These methods update
	its internal state. buildFinished() is now the place that invokes
	maybeStartBuild() on its parent Builder.
	(Builder.consumeTheSoulOfYourPredecessor): new method to allow a
	new Builder to take over for an old one, transferring state from
	the old one.
	(Buider): refactor the way that SlaveBuilders are used to match,
	giving them a bit more autonomy.
	(Builder.buildFinished): this no longer calls maybeStartBuild():
	instead the SlaveBuilder calls it on whoever its parent Builder is
	at the time. This way, when an old Builder is replaced by a new
	one, and there was a build in progress during the transition, when
	that build finishes, it will be the new Builder that is told about
	the newly available slave so it can start a new build.

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.startBuild._release_slave): when
	the Build finishes, tell the SlaveBuilder that they've been
	released.

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (SlaveStatus): add some new setter
	methods for use by BotPerspective, to keep some attributes more
	private

	* buildbot/slave/bot.py (Bot.remote_getDirs): this is no longer
	called by the buildmaster.
	(Bot.setBuilderList): instead, we locally announce any leftover
	directories based upon which Builders we were told about. The
	master doesn't really care; it's the local admin who may or may not
	wish to delete them.


	* contrib/svn_buildbot.py: use /usr/bin/python, not /usr/bin/env,
	to allow use of python2.4 or whatever. This tool still requires
	python2.3 or newer.

2006-11-19  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* NEWS (IStatusLog.readlines): more news items

2006-11-18  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* NEWS: start collecting items for the next release.

2006-11-04  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/changes/bonsaipoller.py: apply updates from Ben
	Hearsum. Closes SF#1590310.
	* buildbot/test/test_bonsaipoller.py: and tests

	* buildbot/status/tinderbox.py
	(TinderboxMailNotifier.buildMessage): send out a "testfailed"
	status when the build results in WARNINGS. Patch from Dave
	Liebreich. Closes SF#1587352.

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (LogFileWatcher.poll): overcome a
	linux-vs-osx behavior difference w.r.t. reading from files that
	have reached EOF. This should fix LogFileWatcher on OS-X. Thanks
	to Mark Rowe for the patch.

2006-10-15  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IStatus.getURLForThing): oops, the
	method name was misspelled in the interface definition. Thanks to
	Roy Rapoport for the catch.

2006-10-13  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Adding LogObservers): update sample code
	to match the great Steps renaming

	* buildbot/steps/transfer.py (FileUpload.start): Fix stupid error.
	Maybe I should run my own unit tests before recording a big
	change. Good thing I've got a buildbot to remind me.

2006-10-12  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/steps/transfer.py: rework __init__ and args setup
	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (SlaveFileDownloadCommand): minor
	docs improvements
	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (SlaveFileDownloadCommand.setup):
	when opening the target file, only catch IOError (to report via
	stderr/rc!=0), let the others be reported as normal exceptions

2006-10-08  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* contrib/svn_watcher.py: fix security holes by using proper argv
	arrays and subprocess.Popen() rather than commands.getoutput().
	Thanks to Nick Mathewson for the patch. Note that svn_watcher.py
	is deprecated in favor of buildbot/changes/svnpoller.py, and will
	probably be removed by the next release.
	* CREDITS: add Nick

2006-10-04  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/steps/python.py (PyFlakes.createSummary): skip any
	initial lines that weren't emitted by pyflakes. When the pyflakes
	command is run under a Makefile, 'make' will echo the command it
	runs to stdio, and that was getting logged as a "misc" warning.
	* buildbot/test/test_steps.py (Python.testPyFlakes2): test it
	* buildbot/test/test_steps.py (testPyFlakes3): another test

2006-10-01  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/html.py (HtmlResource.render): if we get a
	unicode object from our content() method, encode it into utf-8
	like we've been claiming to all along. This allows the comments
	and author names from svnpoller.py to be delivered properly.

	* buildbot/changes/svnpoller.py (SvnSource.create_changes):
	de-unicodify filenames before creating the Change, because the
	rest of buildbot is unlikely to handle them well. Leave the 'who'
	field as a unicode object.. I don't think there's anything that
	will break very soon, and it will probably nudge us towards
	accepting unicode everywhere sooner or later. Stop using the
	"date" field that comes out of SVN, since it is using the
	repository's clock (and timezone) and what we care about is the
	buildmaster's (otherwise Changes from the future show up later
	than the builds they triggered).
	* buildbot/test/test_svnpoller.py (Everything.test1): match the
	change to .when

	* buildbot/changes/svnpoller.py (SvnSource): added Niklaus Giger's
	Suvbersion repository polling ChangeSource. I've hacked it up
	considerably: any bugs are entirely my own fault. Thank you
	Niklaus!
	* buildbot/test/test_svnpoller.py: tests for it
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (SvnSource): document it

2006-09-30  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/scheduler.py (Periodic): submit a reason= to the
	BuildSet to indicate which Scheduler triggered the build. Thanks
	to Mateusz Loskot for the suggestion.
	(Nightly): same
	* buildbot/test/test_scheduler.py (Scheduling.testPeriodic1): test it

	* buildbot/changes/p4poller.py (P4Source): some minor stylistic
	changes: set self.loop in __init__, remove unused volatile=

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (.buildbot config directory): add more
	docs on the .buildbot/options keys used by "buildbot try"
	* buildbot/scripts/tryclient.py (Try.createJob): remove dead code
	(Try.deliverJob): same

	* buildbot/changes/bonsaipoller.py (BonsaiParser): more updates
	from Robert Helmer
	(BonsaiPoller): same

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (LogFileWatcher.stop): explicitly
	close the filehandle when we stop watching the file. Before, the
	filehandle was only closed when the LogFileWatcher was
	garbage-collected, which could be quite a while in the future. If
	it was still open by the time the next build started, windows will
	refuse to let the new build delete the old build/ directory. Fixes
	SF#1568415, thanks to <scmikes>, <FireMoth>, and <radix> on
	#twisted for the catch.

2006-09-29  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/tinderbox.py (TinderboxMailNotifier): updates
	from Robert Helmer

2006-09-25  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* setup.py: the new buildbot.steps module wasn't being installed.
	Thanks to Jose Dapena Paz for the catch, fixes SF#1560631.
	(testmsgs): add the extra stuff from buildbot/test/* so you can
	run unit tests on an installed copy of buildbot, not just from
	the source tree.

	* contrib/svn_buildbot.py (ChangeSender.getChanges): the first *4*
	columns of 'svnlook changed' output contain status information, so
	strip [:4] instead of [:6]. Depending upon what the status flags
	were, this would sometimes lead to mangled filenames. Thanks to
	Riccardo Magliocchetti for the patch. Closes SF#1545146.

	* buildbot/steps/source.py (Monotone): initial Monotone support,
	contributed by Nathaniel Smith. Still needs docs and tests, but
	this code has been in use on the Monotone buildbot for a long
	time now.
	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (Monotone): slave-side support
	* buildbot/changes/monotone.py (MonotoneSource): polling change
	source

	* buildbot/changes/bonsaipoller.py (BonsaiPoller): Ben also
	contributed a Change Source that polls a Bonsai server (a
	kind of web-based viewcvs CGI script).

	* buildbot/status/tinderbox.py (TinderboxMailNotifier): Ben
	Hearsum contributed a status plugin which sends email in the same
	format that Tinderbox does: this allows a number of tinderbox
	tools to be driven by Buildbot instead. Thanks Ben!

2006-09-24  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/changes/mail.py (parseBonsaiMail): fix the parser.
	Thanks to Robert Helmer for the patch.

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.setupSlaveBuilder): tell our
	BuildStatus about the buildslave name at the *beginning* of the
	build, rather than at the end. Thanks to Alexander Lorenz for the
	patch.
	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceBuild.body): always
	include the slavename in the build page, not just when the build
	has finished.
	* buildbot/status/mail.py (MailNotifier.buildMessage): include the
	slavename in the email message

2006-09-21  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/scripts/sample.cfg: update to use new BuildStep classes
	from buildbot.steps
	* docs/examples/glib_master.cfg: same
	* docs/examples/hello.cfg: same
	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: same, update to current usage

2006-09-19  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/steps/python.py (PyFlakes): refactor, add summary logs
	(PyFlakes.createSummary): make it compatible with python-2.2

	* buildbot/test/test_steps.py (Python.testPyFlakes): add a test
	for at least the output-parsing parts of PyFlakes

2006-09-18  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/steps/python.py: oops, fix import of StringIO

2006-09-17  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (VCBase._do_vctest_update_retry_1): it
	turns out that SVN-1.4.0 doesn't fail to update once you've
	replaced a file with a directory, unlike older versions of SVN and
	pretty much every other VC tool we support. Since what we really
	care about is that the update succeeds anyway, stop checking that
	the tree got clobbered and just assert that the build succeeded.
	(VCBase.printLogs): add a utility function for debugging

	* buildbot/process/step.py: oops, added extra imports by mistake

	* buildbot/changes/p4poller.py (P4Source._process_describe): do an
	rstrip() on the first line coming out of the 'p4 describe'
	process, to remove the stray ^M that Wade Brainerd reports seeing
	in the 'when' field. Fixes SF#1555985.

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadConfig): improve the error
	message logged when c['schedulers'] is not right
	* buildbot/scheduler.py (Scheduler.__init__): improve error
	message when a Scheduler() is created with the wrong arguments
	* buildbot/test/test_config.py (ConfigTest.testSchedulerErrors):
	verify that these error messages are emitted

	* buildbot/process/buildstep.py: rename step.py to buildstep.py .
	The idea is that all the base classes (like BuildStep and
	RemoteCommand and LogObserver) live in b.p.buildstep, and b.p.step
	will be a leftover backwards-compatibility file that only contains
	aliases for the steps that were moved out to buildbot.steps.*
	* lots: change imports to match
	* buildbot/process/step.py: add a DeprecationWarning if it ever
	gets imported

2006-09-12  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/scheduler.py (Scheduler.__init__): make sure that
	builderNames= is actually a sequence, since if you happen to give
	it a single builder-specification dictionary instead, it won't get
	caught by the existing assert. Thanks to Brett Neely for the
	catch.

	* buildbot/steps/python.py (BuildEPYDoc, PyFlakes): add new steps. No
	tests yet, alas.
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Python BuildSteps): document them
	(sendchange): include a link to PBChangeSource, since you need one

	* buildbot/steps/shell.py: clean up test-case-name line, remove some
	unnecessary imports
	* buildbot/steps/dummy.py: same

2006-09-08  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/steps/transfer.py (FileUpload,FileDownload): new
	BuildStep which lets you transfer files from the master to the
	slave or vice versa. Thanks to Albert Hofkamp for the original
	patch. Fixes SF#1504631.
	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (SlaveFileUploadCommand): slave-side
	support for it
	(SlaveFileDownloadCommand): same
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Transferring Files): document it
	* buildbot/test/test_transfer.py: test it
	* buildbot/test/runutils.py (StepTester): new utility class for
	testing BuildSteps and RemoteCommands without Builds or Bots or PB
	* buildbot/test/test_steps.py (CheckStepTester): validate that the
	utility class works

	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IStatusLog.readlines): make it easier to
	walk through StatusLogs one line at a time, mostly for the benefit
	of ShellCommand.createSummary methods. You can either walk through
	STDOUT or STDERR, but the default is STDOUT.

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (LogFile.readlines): implement it.
	Note that this is not yet memory-efficient, it just pulls the
	whole file into RAM and then splits it up with a StringIO.
	Eventually this should be a generator that only pulls chunks from
	disk as necessary.
	* buildbot/test/test_status.py (Log.testReadlines): test it

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo: update to match changes
	* buildbot/process/factory.py: stop using old definitions
	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py: same
	* buildbot/test/test_*.py: same

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py: move definition to..
	* buildbot/steps/python_twisted.py: .. here, unfortunately python's
	relative-import mechanisms prevent this from being named 'twisted'
	or 'python/twisted' as I would have preferred.

	* buildbot/process/maxq.py: move definition to..
	* buildbot/steps/maxq.py: .. here, leave a compatibility import

	* buildbot/process/step.py: split the user-visible BuildSteps into
	separate files, all under buildbot/steps/
	* buildbot/steps/source.py: this holds VC-checkout steps like SVN
	* buildbot/steps/shell.py: this holds ShellCommand and friends
	* buildbot/steps/dummy.py: this holds the testing steps like Dummy

2006-09-05  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* lots: run pyflakes, removed a lot of unused imports, changed the
	form of some conditional imports to remove false pyflakes
	warnings. There are still a number of warnings left, mostly from
	imports that are done for their side-effects.
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py: import twisted.python.failure, since it
	was missing

2006-08-26  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_locks.py (Unit.testLater): make the tests
	compatible with twisted-1.3.0, for some reason I just can't seem
	to let go of the past.

2006-08-25  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/mail.py (MailNotifier.__init__): fix typo in docs

	* buildbot/process/step.py (LoggingBuildStep.startCommand): set up
	all logfiles= in startCommand(), rather than in start() . This
	makes it easier to have the 'stdio' log come before any secondary
	logfiles, which I feel makes the waterfall display more
	understandable.
	(LoggingBuildStep.setupLogfiles): move the addLog/cmd.useLog code
	from ShellCommand up into LoggingBuildStep
	(LoggingBuildStep.__init__): move the handling of logfiles= from
	ShellCommand up to LoggingBuildStep, because startCommand is
	provided by LoggingBuildStep, whereas start() was specific to
	subclasses like ShellCommand and Source. This removes code
	duplication in those subclasses.
	(ShellCommand.__init__): same
	(ShellCommand.checkForOldSlaveAndLogfiles): split out the check
	for a slave that's too old to understand logfiles= into a separate
	method, so it can live in ShellCommand. The rest of
	setupLogfiles() can live in LoggingBuildStep.

2006-08-24  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/locks.py (BaseLock): you can now configure Locks to
	allow multiple simultaneous owners. They still default to
	maxCount=1. Fixes SF#1434997. Thanks to James Knight (foom) for
	the patch.
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Interlocks): document the new options
	* buildbot/test/test_locks.py: add a bunch of new unit tests
	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.acquireLocks): locks now offer
	waitUntilMaybeAvailable, not waitUntilAvailable
	* buildbot/process/step.py (BuildStep.acquireLocks): same
	* buildbot/master.py (BotMaster.getLockByID): real locks now use
	the whole lockid in their constructor, not just the name. Also,
	keep track of which real locks we've handed out by the full
	lockid, not just class+name, otherwise changing just the maxCount=
	in the master.cfg file would not actually cause a behavioral
	change

2006-08-23  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): bump to 0.7.4+ while between
	releases
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo: same

2006-08-23  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): Releasing buildbot-0.7.4
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo: set version to match
	* NEWS: update for 0.7.4
	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (command_version): mention that this
	version (2.1) was released with buildbot-0.7.4

2006-08-22  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* README: update

	* CREDITS: new file, list of people who have helped. Thanks!
	* MANIFEST.in: ship it

	* MANIFEST.in: stop shipping the old PyCon-2003 paper.. with the
	new diagrams, the user's manual is more informative than it was.
	Start shipping the .html user's manual (and generated .png
	images).
	* Makefile: update 'release' target to match

	* buildbot/test/test_web.py (GetURL.testBrokenStuff): delete this
	test.. I think the web-parts effort will render it pointless well
	before it ever actually starts to work.

2006-08-20  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/changes/pb.py (PBChangeSource): fix and simplify
	meaning of the prefix= argument. It is now just a string which is
	stripped from the beginning of the filename. If prefix= is set but
	not found on any given filename, that filename is ignored. If all
	filenames in a Change are ignored, the Change is dropped. This is
	much simpler than the previous sep= nonsense, and I should have
	implemented it this way from the beginning. Effectively resolves
	SF#1217699 and SF#1381867. Thanks to Gary Granger and Marius
	Gedminas for the catch and suggested fixes.
	(ChangePerspective.perspective_addChange): implement the actual
	prefix comparison
	* buildbot/test/test_changes.py (TestChangePerspective): test it
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (PBChangeSource): document it, explain
	how to properly use prefix=
	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg (source): update prefix= by
	adding the trailing slash


	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: update to actual practice

	* buildbot/test/test_web.py (WaterfallSteps.test_urls): oops,
	update test case to match new link text.. the HREF has both a
	class= setting and an enclosing [] pair that I didn't match in the
	test.

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (ShellCommand.command=): explain why a
	list of strings is preferred over a single string with embedded
	spaces
	(ShellCommand.description=): explain that either single strings or
	a list of strings is acceptable, and why you might prefer one over
	the other. Add an example. Fixes SF#1524659, thanks to Paul
	Winkler for the catch.
	(Build Steps): update to use f.addStep() rather than using s()
	and the constructor list

	* buildbot/process/step.py (ShellCommand): accept either a single
	string or a list of strings in both description= and
	descriptionDone=
	* buildbot/test/test_steps.py (Steps.test_description): test it
	* buildbot/test/runutils.py (makeBuildStep): support for that test

	* contrib/CSS/*.css: add some contributed CSS stylesheets, to make
	the Waterfall display a bit less ugly. Thanks to John O'Duinn for
	collecting the files and creating the patch.

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (BuildStep URLs): document new feature:
	per-step URLs that will be displayed on the waterfall display,
	for things like the HTML output of code-coverage tools, when
	the results are hosted elsewhere.
	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IBuildStepStatus.getURLs): document the
	way to retrieve these URLs
	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuildStepStatus.getURLs): implement
	the method to retrieve these URLs. Also provide backwards
	compatibility for saved BuildStepStatus instances that didn't have
	the .urls attribute
	* buildbot/process/step.py (BuildStep.addURL): method to set these
	URLs from within a BuildStep
	* buildbot/status/html.py (StepBox.getBox): emit links to the URLs
	(StepBox.getBox): give these external links a distinct CSS class
	named "BuildStep external" so a .css file can display them
	differently

	* buildbot/test/test_web.py (WaterfallSteps): test that we really
	do emit those links
	* buildbot/test/test_steps.py (Steps): test that we can all the
	URLs. Also add a bunch of other tests on methods that can be
	called from within BuildSteps
	* buildbot/test/runutils.py (makeBuildStep): add utility function

2006-08-13  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (BuildStep LogFiles): document them

2006-08-10  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Index of master.cfg keys): add another
	index, this one of things like c['sources'] and c['schedulers']
	(indices): it looks like my clever idea of putting the @fooindex
	commands in between the @node and the @subsection (to make the
	HREF anchor jump to slightly above the section title, which works
	much better in html) confused texinfo horribly, so I'm moving the
	index tags back to be just after the @subsection marker. I also
	added extra lines between the @node/@section paragraph and the
	index tags, since I think maybe texinfo wants to see these be
	separate paragraphs.

	* docs/Makefile (images): make sure images get built when
	rendering the manual
	* docs/images/Makefile: same

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py: rename 'buildbot master' to
	'buildbot create-master', and 'buildbot slave' to 'buildbot
	create-slave'
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo: same
	* README: same

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo: reimplement the "useful classes" index
	with actual texinfo indices. The .info rendering is a bit
	weird-looking but it works well, and the HTML rendering is quite
	nice. This also puts the index targets in the regular flow of the
	text, which is easier to maintain.

2006-08-06  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (ShellCommand.__init__): patch from
	Kevin Turner to prefer the environ= argument be a list rather than
	a string. If it is a list, it will be joined with a platform-local
	os.pathsep delimiter, and then prepended to any existing
	$PYTHONPATH value. This works better in cross-platform (i.e.
	windows buildslaves) environments when you need to push multiple
	directories onto the front of the path.
	(SlaveShellCommand): documented the new magic
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (ShellCommand): documented the new magic
	in a user-visible form

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (BaseHelper.dovc): patch from Kevin
	Turner to prefer lists over strings when creating/running VC
	commands during unit tests. This is clearly necessary to survive
	vcexe containing spaces, like "C:\Program Files\darcs.exe". I
	renamed the wq() function to qw() though, since that's how it's
	spelled in perl. Eventually I'd prefer all commands to be
	specified with lists.

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (LogFileWatcher): handle logfiles
	which are deleted (or not yet created) correctly. Also add
	failsafe code to not explode if the file-watching poller doesn't
	get started. Thanks to JP Calderone for the catch and the poller
	patch.
	* buildbot/test/test_shell.py (SlaveSide._testLogFiles): add test
	for that case
	* buildbot/test/emitlogs.py: same

	* NEWS: summarize recent changes

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Debug options): suggest an .ssh/options
	clause to avoid the "host key mismatch" warning

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (Trial.start): if the
	buildslave is too old to understand logfiles=, fall back to
	running 'cat _trial_temp/test.log' like before.
	(Trial.commandComplete): same. this takes advantage of the
	LoggingBuildStep refactoring to stall commandComplete long enough
	to run a second RemoteShellCommand.

	* buildbot/process/step.py (LoggingBuildStep.startCommand):
	refactor command-completion handling, to allow methods like
	commandComplete/createSummary/evaluateCommand to return Deferreds.
	(LoggingBuildStep._commandComplete): delete the refactored method
	(ShellCommand.setupLogfiles): if the buildslave is too old to
	understand logfiles=, put a warning message both into twistd.log
	and into the otherwise empty user-visible LogFiles.

	* buildbot/process/step.py (LoggedRemoteCommand.useLog): allow
	callers to provide the slave-side logfile name, rather than
	forcing it to come from the local name of the LogFile.
	(BuildStep.getSlaveName): new method

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.getSlaveName): new method, so
	steps can find out which buildslave they're running on

	* buildbot/test/test_steps.py (Version.checkCompare): oops, update
	to match the s/cvs_ver/command_version/ change

2006-08-05  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (command_version): replace the CVS
	auto-updated cvs_ver keyword with a manually-updated variable,
	since CVS is no longer the master repository. Add a description of
	the remote API change starting in this version (2.1), specifically
	the fact that SlaveShellCommand now accepts 'initial_stdin',
	'keep_stdin_open', and 'logfiles'.

2006-07-31  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (System Architecture): Finally add lots of
	diagrams to describe how the whole system fits together. The
	images themselves are kept in SVG files, with ascii-art versions
	in corresponding .txt files. Texinfo knows how to interpolate the
	text version into .info files, reference the .png versions from
	.html files, and include .eps versions in the .ps format.
	* docs/images/Makefile: tools to create .png and .eps
	* docs/images/*.svg: created pictures with Inkscape.
	* .darcs-boring: ignore the generated .eps and .png files

2006-07-24  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadConfig): check for duplicate
	Scheduler names, since they cause setServiceParent to explode
	later.
	* buildbot/test/test_config.py (ConfigTest._testSchedulers_7): test it

2006-07-20  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/scripts/sample.cfg: simplify the sample BuildFactory,
	which runs the buildbot unit tests

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Index of Useful Classes): add a table of
	classes that are useful in master.cfg

2006-07-15  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* Makefile (some-apidocs): new target to build only some epydocs

	* setup.py: minor comment.. does the classifiers= argument prevent
	the setup.py script from working on python2.2/2.3?

	* buildbot/scripts/sample.cfg: update manhole example, arrange into
	major sections

	* buildbot/twcompat.py: fix minor typo in comments

	* buildbot/manhole.py: move all Manhole-related code out to this
	module. Implement SSH-based manholes (with TwistedConch), and move
	to conch's nifty line-editing syntax-coloring REPL shell instead
	of the boring non-editing monochromatic (and deprecated) old
	'telnet' protocol.
	* buildbot/master.py: remove all Manhole-related code
	(BuildMaster.loadConfig._add): make sure the old manhole is
	removed before we add the new one
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Debug options): document new Manhole options

	* buildbot/twcompat.py (_which): fix some epydoc issues
	* buildbot/status/html.py (Waterfall.__init__): same

2006-06-29  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/interfaces.py: get Interface from b.twcompat to hush
	deprecation warnings under newer Twisteds (by using
	zope.interface.Interface instead of old twisted.python.components
	stuff)
	* buildbot/slave/interfaces.py: same

2006-06-28  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (SVN): add --non-interactive to all
	svn commands, so it will fail immediately instead of hanging while
	it waits for a username/password to be typed in.

	* buildbot/slave/bot.py (SlaveBuilder.commandComplete): add minor
	log message if the step was shut down

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (SlaveOptions.longdesc): remove
	obsolete reference to mktap.

2006-06-20  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_steps.py (BuildStep.testShellCommand1): update
	test to include new 'logfiles' argument sent from master to slave

2006-06-19  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (Trial): track Progress from
	_trial_temp/test.log too

	* buildbot/process/step.py (OutputProgressObserver): generalize
	the earlier StdioProgressObserver into an OutputProgressObserver
	that can track LogFiles other than stdio.
	(LoggingBuildStep.__init__): same

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (Trial): use logfiles= to track
	_trial_temp/test.log, not a separate 'cat' command. TODO: this
	will fail under windows because of os.sep issues. It might have
	worked before if 'cat' was doing cygwin path conversion.

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (LogFileWatcher.__init__): note the
	creation of LogFileWatchers
	(ShellCommand._startCommand): and record the files that were
	watched in the 'headers' section of the ShellCommand output

	* buildbot/process/step.py (RemoteShellCommand.__init__): duh, you
	need to actually pass it to the slave if you want it to work.
	(ShellCommand): document it a bit

	* buildbot/test/test_shell.py: new test to validate LogFiles
	* buildbot/test/runutils.py (SlaveCommandTestBase): updates to
	test LogFiles
	* buildbot/test/emitlogs.py: enhance to wait for a line on stdin
	before printing the last batch of lines, to test that the polling
	logic is working properly

	* buildbot/process/step.py (LoggedRemoteCommand): improve LogFile
	handling, making it possible to track multiple logs for a single
	RemoteCommand. The previous single logfile is now known as the
	'stdio' log.
	(LoggedRemoteCommand.remoteUpdate): accept key='log' updates
	(RemoteShellCommand.__init__): accept logfiles=
	(LoggingBuildStep.startCommand): stdio_log is now one of many
	(ShellCommand): added logfiles= argument, as well as a class-level
	.logfiles attribute, which will be merged together to figure out
	which logfiles should be tracked. The latter maybe be useful for
	subclasses of ShellCommand which know they will aways produce
	secondary logfiles in the same location.

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (ShellCommandPP): add writeStdin()
	and closeStdin() methods, preparing to make it possible to write
	to a ShellCommand's stdin at any time, not just at startup. These
	writes are buffered if the child process hasn't started yet.
	(LogFileWatcher): new helper class to watch arbitrary logfiles
	while a ShellCommand runs. This class polls the file every two
	seconds, and sends back 10k chunks to the buildmaster.
	(ShellCommand): rename stdin= to initialStdin=, and add
	keepStdinOpen= and logfiles= to arguments. Set up LogFileWatchers
	at startup.
	(ShellCommand.addLogfile): LogFile text is sent in updates with a
	key of "log" and a value of (logname, data).
	(SlaveShellCommand): add 'initial_stdin', 'keep_stdin_open', and
	'logfiles' to the master-visible args dictionary.
	(SourceBase.doPatch): match s/stdin/initialStdin/ change
	(CVS.start): same
	(P4.doVCFull): same
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (Patch.testPatch): same


	* buildbot/test/emit.py: write to a logfile in the current
	directory. We use this to figure out what was used as a basedir
	rather than looking to see which copy of emit.py gets run, so that
	we can run the commands from inside _trial_temp rather than inside
	buildbot/test
	* buildbot/test/subdir/emit.py: same
	* buildbot/test/runutils.py (FakeSlaveBuilder): take a 'basedir'
	argument rather than running from buildbot/test/
	(SlaveCommandTestBase.setUpBuilder): explicitly set up the Builder
	rather than using an implicit setUp()
	* buildbot/test/test_slavecommand.py (ShellBase.setUp): same
	(ShellBase.testShell1, etc): use explicit path to emit.py instead
	of assuming that we're running in buildbot/test/ (and that '.' is
	on our $PATH)

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (Command.doStart): refactor Command
	startup/completion a bit: now the SlaveBuilder calls doStart(),
	which is not meant for overridding by subclasses, and doStart()
	calls start(), which is. Likewise the SlaveBuilder calls
	doInterrupt(), and subclasses override interrupt(). This also puts
	responsibility for maintaining .running in Command rather than in
	SlaveBuilder.
	(Command.doInterrupt): same
	(Command.commandComplete): same, this is called when the deferred
	returned by start() completes.
	* buildbot/slave/bot.py (SlaveBuilder.remote_startCommand): same
	(SlaveBuilder.remote_interruptCommand): same
	(SlaveBuilder.stopCommand): same

2006-06-16  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_shell.py: new test file to contain everything
	relating to ShellCommand
	(SlaveSide.testLogFiles): (todo) test for the upcoming "watch
	multiple logfiles in realtime" feature, not yet implemented
	* buildbot/test/emitlogs.py: support file for testLogFiles
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (ShellCommand): document the feature

	* buildbot/test/test_steps.py (BuildStep.setUp): rmtree refactoring

	* buildbot/test/runutils.py (SlaveCommandTestBase): utility class
	for tests which exercise SlaveCommands in isolation.

	* buildbot/test/test_slavecommand.py: Move some utilities like
	SignalMixin and FakeSlaveBuilder from here ..
	* buildbot/test/runutils.py: .. to here, so they can be used by
	other test classes too
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py: more SignalMixin refactoring
	* buildbot/test/test_control.py: same
	* buildbot/test/test_run.py: and some rmtree refactoring

2006-06-15  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (P4.testCheckoutBranch): rename from
	'testBranch' to match other VC tests and have the tests run in
	roughly increasing order of dependency

	* buildbot/test/test_steps.py (LogObserver): new test to verify
	LogObservers can be created at various times and still get
	connected up properly

	* buildbot/test/runutils.py (setupBuildStepStatus): utility method
	to create BuildStepStatus instances that actually work.

	* buildbot/process/step.py (LogObserver): add outReceived and
	errReceived base methods, to be overridden

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuildStatus.addStepWithName): change
	API to take a name instead of a step, reducing the coupling
	somewhat. This returns the BuildStepStatus object so it can be
	passed to the new Step, instead of jamming it directly into the
	Step.
	* buildbot/process/step.py (BuildStep.setStepStatus): add a setter
	method
	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.setupBuild): use both methods
	* buildbot/test/test_web.py (Logfile.setUp): rearrange the setup
	process a bit to match

2006-06-14  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Adding LogObservers): add some limited
	docs on writing new LogObserver classes
	(Writing New Status Plugins): brief docs on how Status Plugins fit
	together

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (TrialTestCaseCounter):
	implement a LogObserver that counts how many unit tests have been
	run so far
	(Trial.__init__): wire it in
	* buildbot/test/test_twisted.py (Counter): unit test for it

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (HLint.commandComplete): update
	to new cmd.logs['stdio'] scheme
	(Trial.commandComplete): same
	(BuildDebs.commandComplete): same

	* buildbot/process/step.py (LoggedRemoteCommand): use a dict of
	LogFiles, instead of just a single one. The old single logfile is
	now called "stdio". LoggedRemoteCommand no longer creates a
	LogFile for you (the code to do that was broken anyway). If you
	don't create a "stdio" LogFile, then stdout/stderr will be
	discarded.
	(LogObserver): implement "LogObservers", which a BuildStep can add
	to parse the output of a command in real-time. The primary use is
	to provide more useful information to the Progress code, allowing
	better ETA estimates.
	(LogLineObserver): utility subclass which feeds complete lines to
	the parser instead of bytes.
	(BuildStep.progressMetrics): this is safer as a tuple
	(BuildStep.setProgress): utility method, meant to be called by
	LogObservers
	(BuildStep.addLogObserver): new method, to be called at any time
	during the BuildStep (even before any LogFiles have been created),
	to attach (or schedule for eventual attachment) a LogObserver to a
	LogFile.
	(StdioProgressObserver): new LogObserver which replaces the old
	"output" progress gatherer
	(LoggingBuildStep.__init__): same
	(LoggingBuildStep.startCommand): set up the "stdio" LogFile
	(LoggingBuildStep._commandComplete): must use logs['stdio']
	instead of the old single ".log" attribute.
	* buildbot/status/builder.py (LogFile): remove old logProgressTo
	functionality, now subsumed into StdioProgressObserver
	* buildbot/test/test_status.py (Subscription._testSlave_2): the
	log name changed from "output" to "stdio".


	* buildbot/interfaces.py (ILogFile): add the Interface used from
	the BuildStep towards the LogFile
	(ILogObserver): and the one provided by a LogObserver
	* buildbot/status/builder.py (LogFile): implement it

	* buildbot/interfaces.py (LOG_CHANNEL_*): move STDOUT / STDERR /
	HEADER constants here ..
	* buildbot/status/builder.py (STDOUT): .. from here

2006-06-13  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_p4poller.py (TestP4Poller.failUnlessIn): fix
	compatibility with python2.2, which doesn't have the 'substr in
	str' feature.
	(TestP4Poller.makeTime): utility function to construct the
	timestamp using the same strptime() approach as p4poller does. It
	turns out that time.mktime() behaves slightly differently under
	python2.2, probably something to do with the DST flag, and that
	causes the test to fail under python2.2. (changing the mktime()
	arguments to have dst=0 instead of -1 caused it to fail under
	python2.3. Go figure.)
	(TestP4Poller._testCheck3): use our makeTime() instead of mktime()

2006-06-12  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step.py (P4): merge in patch SF#1473939, adding
	proper Perforce (P4) support. Many many thanks to Scott Lamb for
	contributing such an excellent patch, including docs and unit
	tests! This makes it *so* much easier to apply. I had to update
	test_vc.py to handle some recent refactorings, but everything else
	applied smoothly. The only remaining thing I'd like to fix would
	be to remove the hard-wired port 1666 used by p4d, and allow it to
	claim any unused port. This would allow two copies of the test
	suite to run on the same host at the same time, as well as
	allowing the test suite to run while a real (production) p4d was
	running on the same host. Oh, and maybe we should add a warning to
	step.P4 that gets emitted if the slave is too old to provide the
	'p4' SlaveCommand. Otherwise it looks great. (closes: SF#1473939).
	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (P4): same
	(P4Sync): same, some minor updates
	* buildbot/changes/p4poller.py: same
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo: same
	* buildbot/test/test_p4poller.py: same
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (P4): same

	* setup.py: add Trove classifiers for PyPI

2006-06-08  Brian Warner  <warner@allmydata.com>

	* buildbot/status/client.py
	(RemoteBuilder.remote_getCurrentBuilds): oops, I screwed up when
	changing this from getCurrentBuild() to getCurrentBuilds(). Each
	build needs to be IRemote'd separately, rather than IRemote'ing
	the whole list at once. I can't wait until newpb's serialization
	adapters make this unnecessary.

2006-06-06  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step.py (WithProperties): make this inherit
	from ComparableMixin, so that reloading an unchanged config file
	doesn't cause us to spuriously reload any Builders which use them.
	* buildbot/test/test_config.py (ConfigTest.testWithProperties):
	add a test for it

2006-06-03  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* contrib/windows/{setup.py, buildbot_service.py}: add support for
	running py2exe on windows, contributed by Mark Hammond. Addresses
	SF#1401121, but I think we still need to include
	buildbot/scripts/sample.cfg
	* setup.py: include buildbot_service.py as a script under windows
	* buildbot/status/html.py: when sys.frozen (i.e. we're running in
	a py2exe application), get the icon/css datafiles from a different
	place than usual.

	* buildbot/status/mail.py (MailNotifier.buildMessage): don't
	double-escape the build URL. Thanks to Olivier Bonnet for the
	patch. Fixes SF#1452801.

2006-06-02  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* contrib/svn_buildbot.py (ChangeSender.getChanges): ignore the
	first six columns of 'svnlook' output, not just the first column,
	since property changes appear in the other five. Thanks to Olivier
	Bonnet for the patch. Fixes SF#1398174.

2006-06-01  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_web.py (Logfile.setUp): set the .reason on
	the fake build, so that title= has something to be set to

	* buildbot/status/html.py (BuildBox.getBox): set the 'title='
	attribute of the "Build #NN" link in the yellow start-the-build
	box to the build's reason. This means that you get a little
	tooltip explaining why the build was done when you hover over the
	yellow box. Thanks to Zandr Milewski for the suggestion.

	* buildbot/clients/gtkPanes.py (Box.setColor): ignore color=None
	(Box.setETA): handle ETA=None (by stopping the timer)
	(Box.update): make the [soon] text less different than the usual
	text, so the rest of the text doesn't flop around so much. It
	would be awfully nice to figure out how to center this stuff.
	(ThreeRowBuilder.stepETAUpdate): more debugging printouts

	* buildbot/process/step.py (ShellCommand): set flunkOnFailure=True
	by default, so that any ShellCommand which fails marks the overall
	build as a failure. I should have done this from the beginning.
	Add flunkOnFailure=False to the arguments if you want to turn off
	this behavior.

2006-05-30  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/clients/gtkPanes.py: add a third row: now it shows
	last-build/current-build/current-step. Show what step is currently
	running. Show ETA for both the overall build and the current step.
	Update GTK calls to modern non-deprecated forms. There's still a
	lot of dead code and debug noise to remove.

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (Trial): set the step name, so it
	shows up properly in status displays

2006-05-28  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_properties.py (Run.testInterpolate): on the
	build we use to verify that WithProperties works:

	** set flunkOnFailure=True so that build failures get noticed
	** set workdir='.' so that the build succeeds, otherwise it is trying
	    to touch 'build/something', and 'build/' doesn't exist because
	    usually that's created by a Source step
	** set timeout=10, because Twisted-1.3.0 has a race condition that
	    this test somehow triggers, in which the 'touch' process becomes
	    a zombie and we wait for th etimeout before giving up on it.

	* buildbot/test/runutils.py (RunMixin.logBuildResults): utility method
	to log the Build results and step logs to the twisted log.
	(RunMixin.failUnlessBuildSucceeded): use logBuildResults to record
	what went wrong if a build was expected to succeed but didn't.

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (Trial): set the default
	trialMode to '--reporter=bwverbose', which specifies verbose
	black-and-white text. Back in twisted-1.3/2.0 days we had to use
	'-to', but those are completely missing in modern Twisteds.

	* buildbot/scripts/sample.cfg: make the sample Manhole config use
	a localhost-only port, to encourage better security

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Change Sources): mention
	darcs_buildbot.py

	* .darcs-boring: add a Darcs boringfile

	* README (REQUIREMENTS): stop claiming compatibility with
	Twisted-1.3.0

	* contrib/darcs_buildbot.py: write a darcs-commit-hook change
	sender

2006-05-27  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/__init__.py: bump to 0.7.3+ while between releases
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo: same

2006-05-23  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): Releasing buildbot-0.7.3
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo: set version to match
	* NEWS: update for 0.7.3

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Change Sources): mention hg_buildbot.py,
	give a quick mapping from VC system to possible ChangeSources
	(Build Properties): add 'buildername'

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.setupStatus): oops, set
	'buildername' and 'buildnumber' properties
	* buildbot/test/test_properties.py (Interpolate.testBuildNumber):
	test them

2006-05-22  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Build Properties): explain the syntax of
	property interpolation better

	* README (INSTALLATION): remove old '-v' argument from recommended
	trial command line

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (ShellCommand): add docs for description=
	and descriptionDone= arguments. Thanks to Niklaus Giger for the
	patch. SF#1475494.

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (SVN.parseGotRevision._parse): use
	'svnversion' instead of grepping the output of 'svn info', much
	simpler and avoids CR/LF problems on windows. Thanks to Olivier
	Bonnet for the suggestion.
	(SVN.parseGotRevision): oops, older verisons of 'svnversion'
	require the WC_PATH argument, so run 'svnversion .' instead.

	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IChangeSource): methods in Interfaces
	aren't supposed to have 'self' in their argument list

2006-05-21  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step.py (ShellCommand.start): make
	testInterpolate pass. I was passing the uninterpolated command to
	the RemoteShellCommand constructor
	(ShellCommand._interpolateProperties): oops, handle non-list
	commands (i.e. strings with multiple words separated by spaces in
	them) properly, instead of forgetting about them.

	* buildbot/test/test_properties.py (Run.testInterpolate): new test
	to actually try to use build properties in a real build. This test
	fails.
	* buildbot/test/runutils.py (RunMixin.requestBuild): utility methods
	to start and evaluate builds

	* buildbot/test/test__versions.py: add a pseudo-test to record
	what version of Twisted/Python/Buildbot are running. This should
	show up at the beginning of _trial_tmp/test.log, and exists to help
	debug other problems.

	* buildbot/status/html.py (Waterfall): add 'robots_txt=' argument,
	a filename to be served as 'robots.txt' to discourage web spiders.
	Adapted from a patch by Tobi Vollebregt, thanks!
	* buildbot/test/test_web.py (Waterfall._test_waterfall_5): test it
	(Waterfall.test_waterfall): tweak the way that filenames are put
	into the config file, to accomodate windows pathnames better.

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (HTML Waterfall): document it

	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py
	(QuickTwistedBuildFactory.__init__): recent versions of Twisted
	changed the build process. The new setup.py no longer takes the
	'all' argument.
	(FullTwistedBuildFactory.__init__): same
	(TwistedReactorsBuildFactory.__init__): same

	* contrib/hg_buildbot.py: wrote a commit script for mercurial, to
	be placed in the [hooks] section of the central repository (the
	one that everybody pushes changes to).

2006-05-20  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (Darcs.doVCFull): when writing the
	.darcs-context file, use binary mode. I think this was causing a
	Darcs failure under windows.

2006-05-19  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/scripts/tryclient.py (CVSExtractor.getBaseRevision):
	use a timezone string of +0000 and gmtime, since this timestamp is
	sent to a buildmaster and %z is broken.

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (CVSHelper.getdate): use no timezone
	string and localtime, since this timestamp will only be consumed
	locally, and %z is broken.

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (CVS.parseGotRevision): use +0000 and
	gmtime, since this timestamp is returned to the buildmaster, and
	%z is broken.

2006-05-18  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* NEWS: update in preparation for next release

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (VCS_Helper): factor out all the
	setup-repository and do-we-have-the-vc-tools code into a separate
	"helper" class, which sticks around in a single module-level
	object. This seems more likely to continue to work in the future
	than having it hide in the TestCase and hope that TestCases stick
	around for a long time.

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (MercurialSupport.vc_create): 'hg
	addremove' has been deprecated in recent versions of mercurial, so
	use 'hg add' instead

2006-05-07  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/scheduler.py (Try_Jobdir.messageReceived): when
	operating under windows, move the file before opening it, since
	you can't rename a file that somebody has open.

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.setupBuild): if something goes
	wrong while creating a Step, log the name and arguments, since the
	error message when you get the number of arguments wrong is really
	opaque.

2006-05-06  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (Trial.setupEnvironment): more
	bugs in twisted-specific code not covered by my unit tests, this
	time use 'cmd' argument instead of self.cmd

	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py (TwistedBuild.isFileImportant):
	fix stupid braino: either use startwith or find()==0, not both.
	(TwistedReactorsBuildFactory.__init__): another dumb typo

	* buildbot/test/test_slavecommand.py (ShellBase.testInterrupt1): 
	mark this test as TODO under windows, since process-killing seems
	dodgy there. We'll come back to this later and try to fix it
	properly.

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (CVSSupport.getdate): use localtime,
	and don't include a timezone
	(CVSSupport.vc_try_checkout): stop trying to strip the timezone.
	This should avoid the windows-with-verbose-timezone-name problem
	altogether.
	(Patch.testPatch): add a test which runs 'patch' with less
	overhead than the full VCBase.do_patch sequence, to try to isolate
	a windows test failure. This one uses slave.commands.ShellCommand
	and 'patch', but none of the VC code.

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (getCommand): use which() to find the
	executables for 'cvs', 'svn', etc. This ought to help under
	windows.

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (VCBase.do_getpatch): Delete the
	working directory before starting. If an earlier test failed, the
	leftover directory would mistakenly flunk a later test.
	(ArchCommon.registerRepository): fix some tla-vs-baz problems.
	Make sure that we use the right commandlines if which("tla") picks
	up "tla.exe" (as it does under windows).
	(TlaSupport.do_get): factor out this tla-vs-baz difference
	(TlaSupport.vc_create): more tla-vs-baz differences

	* buildbot/test/test_slavecommand.py
	(ShellBase.testShellMissingCommand): stop trying to assert
	anything about the error message: different shells on different
	OSes with different languages makes it hard, and it really isn't
	that interesting of a thing to test anyway.

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (CVSSupport.capable): skip CVS tests if
	we detect cvs-1.10 (which is the version shipped with OS-X 10.3
	"Panther"), because it has a bug which flunks a couple tests in
	weird ways. I've checked that cvs-1.12.9 (as shipped with debian)
	is ok. OS-X 10.4 "Tiger" ships with cvs-1.11, but I haven't been
	able to test that yet.

2006-04-30  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (VCBase.runCommand): set $LC_ALL="C" to
	make sure child commands emit messages in english, so our regexps
	will match. Thanks to Nikaus Giger for identifying the problems.
	(VCBase._do_vctest_export_1): mode="export" is not responsible
	for setting the "got_revision" property, since in many cases it is
	not convenient to determine.
	(SVNSupport.capable): when running 'svn --version' to check for
	ra_local, we want error messages in english
	* buildbot/test/test_slavecommand.py 
	(ShellBase.testShellMissingCommand): set $LC_ALL="C" to get bash
	to emit the error message in english

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (SourceBase.setup): stash a copy of
	the environment with $LC_ALL="C" so that Commands which need to
	parse the output of their child processes can obtain it in
	english.
	(SVN.parseGotRevision): call "svn info" afterwards instead of
	watching the output of the "svn update" or "svn checkout".
	(Darcs.parseGotRevision): use $LC_ALL="C" when running the command
	(Arch.parseGotRevision): same
	(Bazaar.parseGotRevision): same
	(Mercurial.parseGotRevision): same

	* buildbot/scripts/tryclient.py (SourceStampExtractor.dovc): set
	$LC_ALL="C" when running commands under 'buildbot try', too

	* buildbot/test/__init__.py: remove the global os.environ()
	setting, instead we do it just for the tests that run commands and
	need to parse their output.

	* buildbot/test/test_scheduler.py (Scheduling.testTryJobdir):
	remove the overly-short .timeout on this test, because non-DNotify
	platforms must fall back to polling which happens at 10 second
	intervals, so a 5 second timeout would never succeed.

2006-04-24  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Installing the code): update trial
	invocation, SF#1469116 by Niklaus Giger.
	(Attributes of Changes): updated branch-name examples to be
	a bit more realistic, SF#1475240 by Stephen Davis.

	* contrib/windows/buildbot2.bat: utility wrapper for windows
	developers, contributed by Nick Trout (after a year of neglect..
	sorry!). SF#1194231.

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (*.capable): store the actual VC
	binary's pathname in VCS[vcname], so it can be retrieved later
	(CVSSupport.vc_try_checkout): incorporate Niklaus Giger's patch to
	strip out non-numeric timezone information, specifically the funky
	German string that his system produced that confuses CVS.
	(DarcsSupport.vc_create): use dovc() instead of vc(), this should
	allow Darcs tests to work on windows
	* buildbot/scripts/tryclient.py (SourceStampExtractor): use
	procutils.which() everywhere, to allow tryclient to work under
	windows. Also from Niklaus Giger, SF#1463394.

	* buildbot/twcompat.py (which): move the replacement for a missing
	twisted.python.procutils.which from test_vc.py to here, so it can
	be used in other places too (specifically tryclient.py)

2006-04-23  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceBuild.body): replace the
	bare buildbotURL/projectName line with a proper DIV, along with a
	CSS class of "title", from Stefan Seefeld (SF#1461675).
	(WaterfallStatusResource.body0): remove the redundant 'table'
	class from the table
	(WaterfallStatusResource.body): same. Also add class="LastBuild"
	to the top-row TR, and class="Activity" to the second-row TR,
	rather than putting them in the individual TD nodes.

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (VCBase.checkGotRevision): test
	'got_revision' build property for all VC systems that implement
	accurate ones: SVN, Darcs, Arch, Bazaar, Mercurial.

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (SourceBase._handleGotRevision): try
	to determine which revision we actually obtained
	(CVS.parseGotRevision): implement this for CVS, which just means
	to grab a timestamp. Not ideal, and it depends upon the buildslave
	having a clock that is reasonably well syncronized with the server,
	but it's better than nothing.
	(SVN.parseGotRevision): implement it for SVN, which is accurate
	(Darcs.parseGotRevision): same
	(Arch.parseGotRevision): same
	(Bazaar.parseGotRevision): same
	(Mercurial.parseGotRevision): same

	* buildbot/process/step.py (LoggedRemoteCommand.remoteUpdate):
	keep a record of all non-stdout/stderr/header/rc status updates,
	for the benefit of RemoteCommands that send other useful things,
	like got_revision
	(Source.commandComplete): put any 'got_revision' status values
	into a build property of the same name


	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (Trial): update to deal with
	new ShellCommand refactoring

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Build Properties): document new feature
	that allows BuildSteps to get/set Build-wide properties like which
	revision was requested and/or checked out.

	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IBuildStatus.getProperty): new method
	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuildStatus.getProperty): implement
	it. Note that this bumps the persistenceVersion of the saved Build
	object, so add the necessary upgrade-old-version logic to include
	an empty properties dict.

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.setProperty): implement it
	(Build.getProperty): same
	(Build.startBuild): change build startup to set 'branch',
	'revision', and 'slavename' properties at the right time

	* buildbot/process/step.py (BuildStep.__init__): change setup to
	require 'build' argument in a better way
	(LoggingBuildStep): split ShellCommand into two pieces, for better
	subclassing elsewhere. LoggingBuildStep is a BuildStep which runs
	a single RemoteCommand that sends stdout/stderr status text. It
	also provides the usual commandComplete / createSummary /
	evaluateCommand / getText methods to be overridden...
	(ShellCommand): .. whereas ShellCommand is specifically for
	running RemoteShellCommands. Other shell-like BuildSteps (like
	Source) can inherit from LoggingBuildStep instead of ShellCommand
	(WithProperties): marker class to do build-property interpolation
	(Source): inherit from LoggingBuildStep instead of ShellCommand
	(RemoteDummy): same

	* buildbot/test/test_properties.py: test new functionality

2006-04-21  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py: rename testBranch to
	testCheckoutBranch to keep the tests in about the right
	alphabetical order

2006-04-18  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (PBListener): improve cross-references
	between PBListener and 'buildbot statusgui', thanks to John Pye
	for the suggestion.

2006-04-17  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/twcompat.py (maybeWait): handle SkipTest properly when
	running under Twisted-1.3.0, otherwise skipped tests are reported
	as errors.

	* all: use isinstance() instead of 'type(x) is foo', suggested by
	Neal Norwitz

	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py (QuickTwistedBuildFactory):
	oops, fix a brain-fade from the other week, when making the
	addStep changes. I changed all the __init__ upcalls to use the
	wrong superclass name.
	(FullTwistedBuildFactory.__init__): same
	(TwistedDebsBuildFactory.__init__): same
	(TwistedReactorsBuildFactory.__init__): same
	(TwistedBuild.isFileImportant): use .startswith for clarity,
	thanks to Neal Norwitz for the suggestions.

	* contrib/viewcvspoll.py: script to poll a viewcvs database for
	changes, then deliver them over PB to a remote buildmaster.

	* contrib/svnpoller.py: added script by John Pye to poll a remote
	SVN repository (by running 'svn log') from a cronjob, and run
	'buildbot sendchange' to deliver the changes to a remote
	buildmaster.
	* contrib/svn_watcher.py: added script by Niklaus Giger (a
	modification of svnpoller.py), same purpose, but this one loops
	internally (rather than expecting to run from a cronjob) and works
	under windows.
	* contrib/README.txt: same

2006-04-11  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* all: fix a number of incorrect names and missing imports, thanks
	to Anthony Baxter for the patch.
	* buildbot/status/html.py (WaterfallStatusResource.statusToHTML): 
	remove unused buggy method.
	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuildStatus.saveYourself): rmtree
	comes from shutil, not "shutils"
	* buildbot/process/step.py (TreeSize.evaluateCommand): fix bad name
	(Arch.checkSlaveVersion): same
	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (Trial.commandComplete): same, in
	some disabled code
	* buildbot/process/step_twisted2.py: add some missing imports
	* buildbot/twcompat.py (_deferGenerator): fix cut-and-paste error,
	this code used to live in twisted.internet.defer

2006-04-10  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step.py (Mercurial): add Mercurial support
	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (Mercurial): same
	* buildbot/scripts/tryclient.py (MercurialExtractor): same
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (Mercurial): same, checkout over HTTP is
	not yet tested, but 'try' support *is* covered
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Mercurial): document it

	* buildbot/process/step.py (LoggedRemoteCommand.remoteUpdate): add
	some debugging messages (turned off)
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py: improve debug messages

2006-04-07  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (which): define our own which() in case
	we can't import twisted.python.procutils, because procutils doesn't
	exist in Twisted-1.3

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Interlocks): fix some typos, mention use
	of SlaveLocks for performance tests

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: update to match current usage

	* buildbot/changes/p4poller.py (P4Source): add new arguments:
	password, p4 binary, pollinterval, maximum history to check.
	Patch from an anonymous sf.net contributor, SF#1219384.
	* buildbot/process/step.py (P4Sync.__init__): add username,
	password, and client arguments.
	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (P4Sync): same

2006-04-05  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/factory.py (BuildFactory.addStep): new method
	to add steps to a BuildFactory. Use it instead of f.steps.append,
	and you can probably avoid using the s() convenience function.
	Patch from Neal Norwitz, sf.net #1412605.
	(other): update all factories to use addStep
	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py: update all factories to use
	addStep.

2006-04-03  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py: modified find-the-VC-command logic to
	work under windows too. Adapted from a patch by Niklaus Giger,
	addresses SF#1463399.

	* buildbot/test/__init__.py: set $LANG to 'C', to insure that
	spawned commands emit parseable results in english and not some
	other language. Patch from Niklaus Giger, SF#1463395.

	* README (INSTALLATION): discourage users from running unit tests on
	a "network drive", patch from Niklaus Giger, SF#1463394.

2006-03-22  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* contrib/svn_buildbot.py: rearrange, add an easy-to-change
	function to turn a repository-relative pathname into a (branch,
	branch-relative-filename) tuple. Change this function to handle
	the branch naming policy used by your Subversion repository.
	Thanks to AllMyData.com for sponsoring this work.

2006-03-16  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/scripts/sample.cfg: add python-mode declaration for
	vim. Thanks to John Pye for the patch.

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Launching the daemons): fix @reboot job
	command line, mention the importance of running 'crontab' as the
	buildmaster/buildslave user. Thanks to John Pye for the catch.

2006-03-13  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/words.py (IRC): add an optional password=
	argument, which will be sent to Nickserv in an IDENTIFY message at
	login, to claim the nickname. freenode requires this before the
	bot can sent (or reply to) private messages. Thanks to Clement
	Stenac for the patch.
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (IRC Bot): document it

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (LogFile.merge): don't write chunks
	larger than chunkSize. Fixes SF#1349253.
	* buildbot/test/test_status.py (Log.testLargeSummary): test it
	(Log.testConsumer): update to match new internal chunking behavior

2006-03-12  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py: remove the last use of waitForDeferred

	* buildbot/test/test_maildir.py (MaildirTest): rename the
	'timeout' method, as it collides with trial's internals

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py: add 'buildbot restart' command
	(stop): don't sys.exit() out of here, otherwise restart can't work
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Shutdown): document it

	* buildbot/buildset.py (BuildSet.__init__): clean up docstring
	* buildbot/status/html.py (Waterfall.__init__): same
	* buildbot/process/builder.py (Builder.startBuild): same
	* buildbot/process/base.py (BuildRequest): same
	* buildbot/sourcestamp.py (SourceStamp): same
	* buildbot/scheduler.py (Nightly): same

	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): bump to 0.7.2+ while between
	releases
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo: same

2006-02-17  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): Releasing buildbot-0.7.2
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo: set version number to match
	* NEWS: update for 0.7.2

2006-02-16  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Build Dependencies): add cindex tag

2006-02-09  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (How Different VC Systems Specify Sources):
	add text to explain per-build branch parameters
	* NEWS: mention --umask

2006-02-08  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (Maker.makeSlaveTAC): remove unused
	method
	(SlaveOptions.optParameters): add --umask, to make it possible to
	make buildslave-generated files (including build products) be
	world-readable
	(slaveTAC): same
	* buildbot/slave/bot.py (BuildSlave.startService): same

2006-01-23  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/builder.py: urllib.quote() all URLs that include
	Builder names, so that builders can include characters like '/'
	and ' ' without completely breaking the resulting HTML. Thanks to
	Kevin Turner for the patch.
	* buildbot/status/html.py: same
	* buildbot/test/test_web.py (GetURL.testBuild): match changes

	* NEWS: update in preparation for upcoming release

2006-01-18  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: update to match the Twisted
	buildbot: remove python2.2, switch to exarkun's buildslaves,
	disable the .deb builder until we figure out how to build twisted
	.debs from SVN, add some ktrace debugging to the OS-X build
	process and remove the qt build, remove threadless builders,
	change freebsd builder to use landonf's buildslave.

2006-01-12  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/master.py (Manhole.__init__): let port= be a strports
	specification string, but handle a regular int for backwards
	compatibility. This allows "tcp:12345:interface=127.0.0.1" to be
	used in master.cfg to limit connections to just the local host.
	(BuildMaster.loadConfig): same for c['slavePortnum']
	* buildbot/scheduler.py (Try_Userpass.__init__): same
	* buildbot/status/client.py (PBListener.__init__): same
	* buildbot/status/html.py (Waterfall.__init__): same, for both
	http_port and distrib_port. Include backwards-compatibility checks
	so distrib_port can be a filename string and still mean unix:/foo
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Setting the slaveport): document it
	(Debug options): same
	(HTML Waterfall): same
	(PBListener): same
	(try): same
	* buildbot/test/test_config.py (ConfigTest): test it

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadConfig): wait for the
	slaveport's disownServiceParent deferred to fire before opening
	the new one. Fixes an annoying bug in the unit tests.

2006-01-03  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster): remove the .schedulers
	attribute, replacing it with an allSchedulers() method that looks
	for all IService children that implement IScheduler. Having only
	one parent/child relationship means fewer opportunities for bugs.
	(BuildMaster.allSchedulers): new method
	(BuildMaster.loadConfig_Schedulers): update to use allSchedulers,
	also fix ugly bug that caused any config-file reload to
	half-forget about the earlier Schedulers, causing an exception
	when a Change arrived and was handed to a half-connected
	Scheduler. The exception was in scheduler.py line 54ish:
	  self.parent.submitBuildSet(bs)
	  exceptions.AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute
	  'submitBuildSet'
	(BuildMaster.addChange): update to use allSchedulers()

	* buildbot/scheduler.py (BaseScheduler.__implements__): fix this
	to work properly with twisted-1.3.0, where you must explicitly
	include the __implements__ from parent classes
	(BaseScheduler.__repr__): make it easier to distinguish distinct
	instances
	(BaseUpstreamScheduler.__implements__): same

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (Status.getSchedulers): update to
	use allSchedulers()
	* buildbot/test/test_run.py (Run.testMaster): same
	* buildbot/test/test_dependencies.py (Dependencies.findScheduler): same
	* buildbot/test/test_config.py (ConfigTest.testSchedulers): same,
	make sure Scheduler instances are left alone when an identical
	config file is reloaded
	(ConfigElements.testSchedulers): make sure Schedulers are properly
	comparable

	* Makefile (TRIALARGS): my local default Twisted version is now
	2.1.0, update the trial arguments accordingly

2005-12-22  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: merge changes from pyr: add
	new win32 builders

	* buildbot/scheduler.py (BaseScheduler.addChange): include a dummy
	addChange in the parent class, although I suspect this should be
	fixed better in the future.

2005-11-26  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/scheduler.py (AnyBranchScheduler.addChange): don't
	explode when branch==None, thanks to Kevin Turner for the catch
	* buildbot/test/test_scheduler.py (Scheduling.testAnyBranch): test
	it

	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): bump to 0.7.1+ while between
	releases
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo: same

2005-11-26  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): Releasing buildbot-0.7.1
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo: set version number to match

2005-11-26  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* NEWS: update for 0.7.1

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuildStepStatus.unsubscribe): make
	sure that unsubscribe works even if we never sent an ETA update.
	Also, don't explode on duplicate unsubscribe.
	(BuildStepStatus.addLog): make the convenience "return self"-added
	watcher automatically unsubscribe when the Step finishes.
	(BuildStatus.unsubscribe): same handle-duplicate-unsubscribe
	(BuildStatus.stepStarted): same auto-unsubscribe
	(BuilderStatus.buildStarted): same auto-unsubscribe

	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IStatusReceiver.buildStarted): document
	auto-unsubscribe
	(IStatusReceiver.stepStarted): same
	(IStatusReceiver.logStarted): same

	* buildbot/test/test_run.py (Status): move the Status test..
	* buildbot/test/test_status.py (Subscription): .. to here

2005-11-25  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* NEWS: more updates

	* buildbot/locks.py: fix the problem in which loading a master.cfg
	file that changes some Builders (but not all of them) can result
	in having multiple copies of the same Lock. Now, the real Locks
	are kept in a table inside the BotMaster, and the Builders/Steps
	use "LockIDs", which are still instances of MasterLock and
	SlaveLock. The real Locks are instances of the new RealMasterLock
	and RealSlaveLock classes.
	* buildbot/master.py (BotMaster.getLockByID): new method to
	convert LockIDs into real Locks.
	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.startBuild): convert LockIDs
	into real Locks before building
	* buildbot/process/step.py (BuildStep.startStep): same
	* buildbot/test/test_locks.py (Locks.testLock1a): add a test which
	exercises the problem


	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Scheduler Types): give a few hints about
	what Schedulers are available

	* buildbot/scheduler.py (Nightly): add new Scheduler based upon
	work by Dobes Vandermeer and hacked mercilessly by me. This offers
	'cron'-style build scheduling at certain times of day, week,
	month, or year.
	* buildbot/test/test_scheduler.py (Scheduling.testNightly): test it

	* buildbot/scheduler.py (Scheduler): change fileIsImportant
	handling: treat self.fileIsImportant more as an attribute that
	contains a callable than as a method. If the attribute is None,
	don't call it and assume all filenames are important. It is still
	possible to provide a fileIsImportant method in a subclass,
	however.
	(AnyBranchScheduler): handle fileIsImportant=None, previously it
	was broken
	* buildbot/test/test_scheduler.py (Scheduling.testAnyBranch2):
	test using AnyBranchScheduler with fileIsImportant=None

2005-11-24  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_config.py (StartService): don't claim a fixed
	port number, instead set slavePort=0 on the first pass, figure out
	what port was allocated, then switch to a config file that uses
	the allocated port.

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadConfig): close the old
	slaveport before opening the new one, because unit tests might
	replace slavePort=0 with the same allocated portnumber, and if we
	don't wait for the old port to close first, we get a "port already
	in use" error. There is a tiny race condition here, but the only
	threat is from other programs that bind (statically) to the same
	port number we happened to be allocated, and only if those
	programs use SO_REUSEADDR, and only if they get control in between
	reactor turns.

	* Makefile (TRIALARGS): update to handle Twisted > 2.1.0

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadConfig_Sources): remove all
	deleted ChangeSources before adding any new ones
	* buildbot/changes/freshcvs.py (FreshCVSSourceNewcred): fix
	compare_attrs, to make sure that a config-file reload does not
	unnecessarily replace an unmodified ChangeSource instance
	* buildbot/test/test_config.py (ConfigTest.testSources): update

	* buildbot/scheduler.py (AnyBranchScheduler): fix branches=[] to
	mean "don't build anything", and add a warning if it gets used
	because it isn't actually useful.

	* contrib/svn_buildbot.py: update example usage to match the port
	number that gets used by the PBChangeSource
	* buildbot/scripts/sample.cfg: add example of PBChangeSource

2005-11-22  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* NEWS: start collecting items for next release

	* buildbot/process/step.py (SVN.computeSourceRevision): assume
	revisions are strings
	(P4Sync.computeSourceRevision): same

	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceBuild.body): add a link
	to the Buildbot's overall status page
	(StatusResourceBuilder.body): same

2005-11-15  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadConfig): serialize the
	config-file loading, specifically to make sure old StatusTargets
	are finished shutting down before new ones start up (thus
	resolving a bug in which changing the Waterfall object would fail
	because both new and old instances were claiming the same
	listening port). Also load new Schedulers after all the new
	Builders are set up, in case they fire off a new build right away.
	* buildbot/test/test_config.py (StartService): test it

	* buildbot/status/mail.py (MailNotifier.buildMessage): oops, add
	the branch name to the mail body

	* buildbot/changes/pb.py (PBChangeSource.compare_attrs): add this.
	Without it, a config-file reload fails to update an existing
	PBChangeSource.
	* buildbot/changes/freshcvs.py (FreshCVSSourceNewcred): add
	username/passwd to compare_attrs, for the same reason
	* buildbot/status/html.py (Waterfall): add favicon to
	compare_attrs, same reason

2005-11-05  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/scripts/tryclient.py (createJobfile): stringify the
	baserev before stuffing it in the jobfile. This resolves problems
	under SVN (and probably Arch) where revisions are expressed as
	numbers. I'm inclined to use string-based revisions everywhere in
	the future, but this fix should be safe for now. Thanks to Steven
	Walter for the patch.

	* buildbot/changes/changes.py (ChangeMaster.saveYourself): use
	binary mode when opening pickle files, to make windows work
	better. Thanks to Dobes Vandermeer for the catch.
	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuildStatus.saveYourself): same
	(BuilderStatus.getBuildByNumber): same
	(Status.builderAdded): same
	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadChanges): same

	* buildbot/util.py (Swappable): delete unused leftover code

	* buildbot/process/step.py (SVN): when building on a non-default
	branch, add the word "[branch]" to the VC step's description, so
	it is obvious that we're not building the usual stuff. Likewise,
	when we are building a specific revision, add the text "rNNN" to
	indicate what that revision number is. Thanks to Brad Hards and
	Nathaniel Smith for the suggestion.
	(Darcs.startVC): same
	(Arch.startVC): same
	(Bazaar.startVC): same

	* buildbot/process/factory.py (GNUAutoconf.__init__): fix a silly
	typo, caught by Mark Dillavou, closes SF#1216636.

	* buildbot/test/test_status.py (Log.TODO_testDuplicate): add notes
	about a test to add some day

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: update: bot1 can now handle
	the 'full-2.3' build, and the 'reactors' build is now run under
	python-2.4 because the buildslave no longer has gtk/etc bindings
	for earlier versions.

2005-11-03  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IBuilderControl.resubmitBuild): new
	method, takes an IBuildStatus and rebuilds it. It might make more
	sense to add this to IBuildControl instead, but that instance goes
	away completely once the build has finished, and resubmitting
	builds can take place weeks later.
	* buildbot/process/builder.py (BuilderControl.resubmitBuild): same
	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceBuild): also stash an
	IBuilderControl so we can use resubmitBuild.
	(StatusResourceBuild.body): render "resubmit" button if we can.
	Also add hrefs for each BuildStep
	(StatusResourceBuild.rebuild): add action for "resubmit" button
	(StatusResourceBuilder.getChild): give it an IBuilderControl

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (Status.getURLForThing): change the
	URL for BuildSteps to have a "step-" prefix, so the magic URLs
	that live as targets of buttons like "stop" and "rebuild" can't
	collide with them.
	* buildbot/status/builder.py (Status.getURLForThing): same
	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceBuild.getChild): same
	(StepBox.getBox): same
	* buildbot/test/test_web.py (GetURL): same
	(Logfile): same

	* buildbot/process/step.py (SVN.__init__): put svnurl/baseURL
	exclusivity checks after Source.__init__ upcall, so misspelled
	arguments will be reported more usefully
	(Darcs.__init__): same

2005-10-29  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: don't double-fire the 'quick'
	builder. Move the Try scheduler off to a separate port.

2005-10-27  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/clients/gtkPanes.py
	(TwoRowClient.remote_builderRemoved): disappearing Builders used
	to cause the app to crash, now they don't.

	* buildbot/clients/debug.py: display the buildmaster's location
	in the window's title bar

2005-10-26  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/mail.py (MailNotifier): urllib.escape the URLs
	in case they have spaces or whatnot. Patch from Dobes Vandermeer.
	* buildbot/test/test_status.py (MyStatus.getURLForThing): fix it

	* buildbot/status/html.py (td): put a single non-breaking space
	inside otherwise empty <td> elements, as a workaround for buggy
	browsers which would optimize them away (along with any associated
	styles, like the kind that create the waterfall grid borders).
	Patch from Frerich Raabe.

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (Trial): expose the trialMode=
	argv-list as an argument, defaulting to ["-to"], which is
	appropriate for the Trial that comes with Twisted-2.1.0 and
	earlier. The Trial in current Twisted SVN wants
	["--reporter=bwverbose"] instead. Also expose trialArgs=, which
	defaults to an empty list.
	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py (TwistedTrial.trialMode):
	match it, now that trialMode= is a list instead of a single string

	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): bump to 0.7.0+ while between
	releases
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo: same

2005-10-24  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): Releasing buildbot-0.7.0
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo: set version number to match

2005-10-24  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* README: update for 0.7.0
	* NEWS: same
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo: move the freshcvs stuff out of the README

	* buildbot/clients/debug.glade: add 'branch' box to fake-commit
	* buildbot/clients/debug.py (DebugWidget.do_commit): same. Don't
	send the branch= argument unless the user really provided one, to
	retain compatibility with older buildmasters that don't accept
	that argument.
	* buildbot/master.py (DebugPerspective.perspective_fakeChange):
	same

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo: update lots of stuff

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (sendchange): add a --branch argument
	to the 'buildbot sendchange' command
	* buildbot/clients/sendchange.py (Sender.send): same
	* buildbot/changes/pb.py (ChangePerspective): same
	* buildbot/test/test_changes.py (Sender.testSender): test it

	* buildbot/process/step.py (SVN.__init__): change 'base_url' and
	'default_branch' argument names to 'baseURL' and 'defaultBranch',
	for consistency with other BuildStep arguments that use camelCase.
	Well, at least more of them use camelCase (like flunkOnWarnings)
	than don't.. I wish I'd picked one style and stuck with it
	earlier. Annoying, but it's best done before the release, since
	these arguments didn't exist at all in 0.6.6 .
	(Darcs): same
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (SVN.testCheckout): same
	(Darcs.testPatch): same
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (SVN): document the change
	(Darcs): same, add some build-on-branch docs
	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: match change

	* buildbot/process/step.py (BuildStep): rename
	slaveVersionNewEnough to slaveVersionIsOlderThan, because that's
	how it is normally used.
	* buildbot/test/test_steps.py (Version.checkCompare): same

	* buildbot/process/step.py (CVS.startVC): refuse to build
	update/copy -style builds on a non-default branch with an old
	buildslave (<=0.6.6) that doesn't know how to do it properly. The
	concern is that it will do a VC 'update' in an existing tree when
	it is supposed to be switching branches (and therefore clobbering
	the tree to do a full checkout), thus building the wrong source.
	This used to be a warning, but I think the confusion it is likely
	to cause warrants making it an error.
	(SVN.startVC): same, also make mode=export on old slaves an error
	(Darcs.startVC): same
	(Git.startVC): improve error message for non-Git-enabled slaves
	(Arch.checkSlaveVersion): same. continue to emit a warning when a
	specific revision is built on a slave that doesn't pay attention
	to args['revision'], because for slowly-changing trees it will
	probably do the right thing, and because we have no way to tell
	whether we're asking it to build the most recent version or not.
	* buildbot/interfaces.py (BuildSlaveTooOldError): new exception

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (SlaveOptions.postOptions): assert
	that 'master' is in host:portnum format, to catch errors sooner

2005-10-23  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (ProcessDocs.createSummary):
	when creating the list of warning messages, include the line
	immediately after each WARNING: line, since that's usually where
	the file and line number wind up.

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: OS-X slave now does QT, add a
	TryScheduler

	* NEWS: update

2005-10-22  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/html.py (HtmlResource): incorporate valid-HTML
	patch from Brad Hards
	* buildbot/status/classic.css: same
	* buildbot/test/test_web.py (Waterfall): match changes

	* buildbot/test/test_steps.py (BuildStep.setUp): set
	nextBuildNumber so the test passes
	* buildbot/test/test_status.py (MyBuilder): same

	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceBuild.body): revision
	might be numeric, so stringify it before html-escapifying it
	(CurrentBox.getBox): add a "waiting" state, and show a countdown
	timer for the upcoming build
	* buildbot/status/classic.css: add background-color attributes for
	offline/waiting/building classes

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuildStatus): derive from
	styles.Versioned, fix upgrade of .sourceStamp attribute. Also set
	the default (i.e. unknown) .slavename to "???" instead of None,
	since even unknown slavenames need to be printed eventually.
	(BuilderStatus): also derive from styles.Versioned . More
	importantly, determine .nextBuildNumber at creation/unpickling
	time by scanning the directory of saved BuildStatus instances and
	choosing one larger than the highest-numbered one found. This
	should fix the problem where random errors during upgrades cause
	the buildbot to forget about earlier builds. .nextBuildNumber is
	no longer stored in the pickle.
	(Status.builderAdded): if we can't unpickle the BuilderStatus,
	at least log the error. Also call Builder.determineNextBuildNumber
	once the basedir is set.

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadChanges): do
	styles.doUpgrade afterwards, in case I decide to make Changes
	derived from styles.Versioned some day and forget to make this
	change later.


	* buildbot/test/test_runner.py (Options.testForceOptions): skip
	when running under older pythons (<2.3) in which the shlex module
	doesn't have a 'split' function.

	* buildbot/process/step.py (ShellCommand.start): make
	errorMessages= be a list of strings to stuff in the log before the
	command actually starts. This makes it easier to flag multiple
	warning messages, e.g. when the Source steps have to deal with an
	old buildslave.
	(CVS.startVC): handle slaves that don't handle multiple branches
	by switching into 'clobber' mode
	(SVN.startVC): same. Also reject branches without base_url
	(Darcs.startVC): same. Also reject revision= in older slaves
	(Arch.checkSlaveVersion): same (just the multiple-branches stuff)
	(Bazaar.startVC): same, and test for baz separately than for arch

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (cvs_ver): document new features

	* buildbot/process/step.py (BuildStep.slaveVersion): document it
	(BuildStep.slaveVersionNewEnough): more useful utility method
	* buildbot/test/test_steps.py (Version): start testing it

	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcStatusBot.command_FORCE): note that
	the 'force' command requires python2.3, for the shlex.split method

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: remove old freshcvs stuff,
	since we don't use it anymore. The Twisted buildbot uses a
	PBChangeSource now.

2005-10-21  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py: rework all BuildFactory
	classes to take a 'source' step as an argument, instead of
	building up the SVN instance in the factory.
	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: enable build-on-branch by
	providing a base_url and default_branch

	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcStatusBot.command_FORCE): add
	control over --branch and --revision, not that they are always
	legal to provide
	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceBuilder.force): same
	(StatusResourceBuild.body): display SourceStamp components

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (ForceOptions): option parser for the
	IRC 'force' command, so it can be shared with an eventual
	command-line-tool 'buildbot force' mode.
	* buildbot/test/test_runner.py (Options.testForceOptions): test it

2005-10-20  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/mail.py (MailNotifier.buildMessage): reformat

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: update to use Schedulers

	* buildbot/scripts/sample.cfg: update with Schedulers

	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IBuilderControl.requestBuildSoon): new
	method specifically for use by HTML "force build" button and the
	IRC "force" command. Raises an immediate error if there are no
	slaves available.
	(IBuilderControl.requestBuild): make this just submit a build, not
	try to check for existing slaves or set up any when-finished
	Deferreds or anything.
	* buildbot/process/builder.py (BuilderControl): same
	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceBuilder.force): same
	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcStatusBot.command_FORCE): same
	* buildbot/test/test_slaves.py: same
	* buildbot/test/test_web.py: same

2005-10-19  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: re-sync with reality: bring
	back python2.2 tests, turn off OS-X threadedselect-reactor tests

2005-10-18  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/html.py: provide 'status' argument to most
	StatusResourceFOO objects
	(StatusResourceBuild.body): href-ify the Builder name, add "Steps
	and Logfiles" section to make the Build page into a more-or-less
	comprehensive source of status information about the build

	* buildbot/status/mail.py (MailNotifier): include the Build's URL
	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcStatusBot.buildFinished): same

2005-10-17  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py (TwistedTrial): update Trial
	arguments to accomodate Twisted >=2.1.0 . I will have to figure
	out what to do about other projects: the correct options for
	recent Twisteds will not work for older ones.

2005-10-15  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (Status.getURLForThing): add method
	to provide a URL for arbitrary IStatusFoo objects. The idea is to
	use this in email/IRC status clients to make them more useful, by
	providing the end user with hints on where to learn more about the
	object being reported on.
	* buildbot/test/test_web.py (GetURL): tests for it

2005-10-14  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_config.py (ConfigTest._testSources_1): oops,
	fix bug resulting from deferredResult changes

2005-10-13  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_changes.py: remove use of deferredResult
	* buildbot/test/test_config.py: same
	* buildbot/test/test_control.py: same
	* buildbot/test/test_status.py: same
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py: this is the only remaining use, since
	it gets used at module level. This needs to be replaced by some
	sort of class-level run-once routine.

	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcStatusBot.command_WATCH): fix typo

	* lots: implement multiple slaves per Builder, which means multiple
	current builds per Builder. Some highlights:
	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IBuilderStatus.getState): return a tuple
	of (state,currentBuilds) instead of (state,currentBuild)
	(IBuilderStatus.getCurrentBuilds): replace getCurrentBuild()
	(IBuildStatus.getSlavename): new method, so you can tell which
	slave got used. This only gets set when the build completes.
	(IBuildRequestStatus.getBuilds): new method

	* buildbot/process/builder.py (SlaveBuilder): add a .state
	attribute to track things like ATTACHING and IDLE and BUILDING,
	instead of..
	(Builder): .. the .slaves attribute here, which has been turned
	into a simple list of available slaves. Added a separate
	attaching_slaves list to track ones that are not yet ready for
	builds.
	(Builder.fireTestEvent): put off the test-event callback for a
	reactor turn, to make tests a bit more consistent.
	(Ping): cleaned up the slaveping a bit, now it disconnects if the
	ping fails due to an exception. This needs work, I'm worried that
	a code error could lead to a constantly re-connecting slave.
	Especially since I'm trying to move to a distinct remote_ping
	method, separate from the remote_print that we currently use.
	(BuilderControl.requestBuild): return a convenience Deferred that
	provides an IBuildStatus when the build finishes.
	(BuilderControl.ping): ping all connected slaves, only return True
	if they all respond.

	* buildbot/slave/bot.py (BuildSlave.stopService): stop trying to
	reconnect when we shut down.

	* buildbot/status/builder.py: implement new methods, convert
	one-build-at-a-time methods to handle multiple builds
	* buildbot/status/*.py: do the same in all default status targets
	* buildbot/status/html.py: report the build's slavename in the
	per-Build page, report all buildslaves on the per-Builder page

	* buildbot/test/test_run.py: update/create tests
	* buildbot/test/test_slaves.py: same
	* buildbot/test/test_scheduler.py: remove stale test

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo: document the new builder-specification
	'slavenames' parameter

2005-10-12  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/buildset.py (BuildSet): fix bug where BuildSet did not
	report failure correctly, causing Dependent builds to run when
	they shouldn't have.
	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuildSetStatus): same
	* buildbot/test/test_buildreq.py (Set.testBuildSet): verify it
	(Set.testSuccess): test the both-pass case too
	* buildbot/test/test_dependencies.py (Dependencies.testRun_Fail):
	fix this test: it was ending too early, masking the failure before
	(Logger): specialized StatusReceiver to make sure the dependent
	builds aren't even started, much less completed.

2005-10-07  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/slave/bot.py (SlaveBuilder.activity): survive
	bot.SlaveBuilder being disowned in the middle of a build

	* buildbot/status/base.py (StatusReceiverMultiService): oops, make
	this inherit from StatusReceiver. Also upcall in __init__. This
	fixes the embarrasing crash when the new buildSetSubmitted method
	is invoked and Waterfall/etc don't implement their own.
	* buildbot/test/test_run.py: add a TODO note about a test to catch
	just this sort of thing.

	* buildbot/process/builder.py (Builder.attached): remove the
	already-attached warning, this situation is normal. Add some
	comments explaining it.

2005-10-02  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/changes/maildir.py (Maildir.start): Tolerate
	OverflowError when setting up dnotify, because some 64-bit systems
	have problems with signed-vs-unsigned constants and trip up on the
	DN_MULTISHOT flag. Patch from Brad Hards.

2005-09-06  Fred Drake  <fdrake@users.sourceforge.net>

	* buildbot/process/step.py (BuildStep, ShellCommand): Add
	progressMetrics, description, descriptionDone to the 'parms' list,
	and make use the 'parms' list from the implementation class
	instead of only BuildStep to initialize the parameters.  This
	allows buildbot.process.factory.s() to initialize all the parms,
	not just those defined in directly by BuildStep.

2005-09-03  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* NEWS: start adding items for the next release

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: (sync with reality) turn off
	python2.2 tests, change 'Quick' builder to only use python2.3

2005-09-02  Fred Drake  <fdrake@users.sourceforge.net>

	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceBuilder.body): only show
	the "Ping Builder" button if the build control is available; the
	user sees an exception otherwise

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (PBChangeSource): fix a typo

2005-09-01  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IBuilderStatus.getState): update
	signature, point out that 'build' can be None
	(IBuildStatus.getETA): point out ETA can be none

	* buildbot/status/html.py (CurrentBox.getBox): tolerate build/ETA
	being None
	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcStatusBot.emit_status): same

2005-08-31  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/base.py (StatusReceiver.builderChangedState):
	update to match correct signature: removed 'eta' argument
	* buildbot/status/mail.py (MailNotifier.builderChangedState): same

2005-08-30  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (LogFile): remove the assertion that
	blows up when you try to overwrite an existing logfile, instead
	just emit a warning. This case gets hit when the buildmaster is
	killed and doesn't get a chance to write out the serialized
	BuilderStatus object, so the .nextBuildNumber attribute gets out
	of date.

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (sendchange): add --revision_file to
	the 'buildbot sendchange' arguments, for the Darcs context file
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (sendchange): document it

	* buildbot/status/html.py: add pending/upcoming builds to CurrentBox
	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IScheduler.getPendingBuildTimes): new method
	(IStatus.getSchedulers): new method
	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuilderStatus): track pendingBuilds
	(Status.getSchedulers): implement
	* buildbot/process/builder.py (Builder): maintain
	BuilderStatus.pendingBuilds
	* buildbot/scheduler.py (Scheduler.getPendingBuildTimes): new method
	(TryBase.addChange): Try schedulers should ignore Changes

	* buildbot/scripts/tryclient.py (getTopdir): implement getTopdir
	for 'try' on CVS/SVN
	* buildbot/test/test_runner.py (Try.testGetTopdir): test case

	* buildbot/scripts/tryclient.py (Try): make jobdir-style 'try'
	report status properly.
	(Try.createJob): implement unique buildset IDs

	* buildbot/status/client.py (StatusClientPerspective): add a
	perspective_getBuildSets method for the benefit of jobdir-style
	'try'.
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (try): more docs
	* buildbot/test/test_scheduler.py (Scheduling.testGetBuildSets):
	new test case

2005-08-18  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/scripts/tryclient.py (Try): make 'try' status reporting
	actually work. It's functional but still kind of clunky. Also, it
	only works with the pb-style.. needs to be made to work with the
	jobdir-style too.

	* buildbot/status/client.py (RemoteBuildSet): new class
	(RemoteBuildRequest): same
	(RemoteBuild.remote_waitUntilFinished): return the RemoteBuild
	object, not the internal BuildStatus object.
	(RemoteBuild.remote_subscribe): new method to subscribe to builds
	outside of the usual buildStarted() return value.
	(BuildSubscriber): support class for RemoteBuild.remote_subscribe

	* buildbot/scheduler.py (Try_Jobdir): convey buildsetID properly
	(Try_Userpass_Perspective.perspective_try): return a remotely
	usable BuildSetStatus object

	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IBuildStatus): remove obsolete
	isStarted()/waitUntilStarted()

2005-08-16  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/builder.py: implement IBuildSetStatus and
	IBuildRequestStatus, wire them into place.
	* buildbot/buildset.py: same. Add ID, move wait-until-finished
	methods into the BuildSetStatus object.
	* buildbot/interfaces.py: same
	(IStatus.getBuildSets): new method to get pending BuildSets
	(IStatusReceiver.buildsetSubmitted): new method which hears about
	new BuildSets
	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.submitBuildSet): same
	* buildbot/process/base.py (BuildRequest): same, replace
	waitUntilStarted with subscribe/unsubscribe
	* buildbot/process/builder.py (BuilderControl.forceBuild): use
	subscribe instead of waitUntilStarted
	* buildbot/status/base.py (StatusReceiver.buildsetSubmitted): stub
	for new method
	* buildbot/status/client.py (StatusClientPerspective.builderRemoved): 
	same
	* buildbot/test/test_buildreq.py: update for new code
	* buildbot/test/test_control.py (Force.testRequest): same


	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (Darcs.doVCFull): fix get-revision
	for Darcs to not use the tempfile module, so it works under
	python-2.2 too. We really didn't need the full cleverness of that
	module, since the slave has exclusive control of its own builddir.

2005-08-15  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/scripts/tryclient.py (CVSExtractor): implement 'try'
	for CVS trees. It doesn't work for non-trunk branches,
	unfortunately.
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (CVS.testTry): test it, but skip the
	branch test

	* Makefile: make it easier to test against python2.2

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (VCBase.tearDown): provide for
	tearDown2, so things like Arch can unregister archives as they're
	shutting down. The previous subclass-override-tearDown technique
	resulted in a nested maybeWait() and test failures under
	Twisted-1.3.0

	* buildbot/scripts/tryclient.py (getSourceStamp): extract branches
	where we can (Arch), add a branch= argument to set the branch used
	when we can't
	(BazExtractor): extract the branch too
	(TlaExtractor): same
	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (TryOptions): add --branch
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (try): document --branch/try_branch

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (Darcs): implement get-revision for
	Darcs, so that 'try' will work. This requires the tempfile module
	from python-2.3 .

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py: rewrite tests, getting better coverage
	of revisions, branches, and 'try' in the process.

2005-08-11  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/master.py (DebugPerspective.perspective_pokeIRC): fix
	this, it got broken at some point in the last few releases
	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcBuildRequest): reply was broken
	(IrcStatusBot.emit_status): handle new IBuilderStatus.getState,
	specifically the removal of ETA information from the tuple

	* buildbot/locks.py: use %d for id() instead of %x, avoid a silly
	warning message

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (try): document both --builder and
	'try_builders' in .buildbot/options
	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (TryOptions): add --builder,
	accumulate the values into opts['builders']
	* buildbot/scripts/tryclient.py (Try.__init__): set builders
	* buildbot/test/test_runner.py (Try): add some quick tests to make
	sure 'buildbot try --options' and .buildbot/options get parsed
	* buildbot/test/test_scheduler.py (Scheduling.testTryUserpass):
	use --builder control

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (try): add --port argument to PB style

	* buildbot/scripts/tryclient.py (SourceStampExtractor): return an
	actual SourceStamp. Still need to extract a branch name, somehow.
	(Try): finish implementing the try client side, still need a UI
	for specifying which builders to use
	(Try.getopt): factor our options/config-file reading
	* buildbot/test/test_scheduler.py (Scheduling.testTryUserpass):
	test it
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py: match SourceStampExtractor change

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (Options.opt_verbose): --verbose
	causes the twisted log to be sent to stderr

	* buildbot/scheduler.py (Try_Userpass): implement the PB style

2005-08-10  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py: Add 'buildbot try' command, jobdir
	style is 90% done, still missing status reporting or waiting for
	the buildsets to finish, and it is completely untested.

	* buildbot/trybuild.py: delete file, move contents to ..
	* buildbot/scripts/tryclient.py (getSourceStamp): .. here
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py: match the move

	* buildbot/scheduler.py (Try_Jobdir): implement the jobdir style
	of the TryScheduler, no buildsetID or status-tracking support yet
	* buildbot/test/test_scheduler.py (Scheduling.testTryJobdir): test it

	* buildbot/changes/maildir.py (Maildir.setBasedir): make it
	possible to set the basedir after __init__ time, so it is easier
	to use as a Service-child of the BuildMaster instance

	* buildbot/changes/maildirtwisted.py (MaildirService): make a form
	that delivers messages to its Service parent instead of requiring
	a subclass to be useful. This turns out to be much easier to build
	unit tests around.

	* buildbot/scripts/tryclient.py (createJob): utility code to
	create jobfiles, will eventually be used by 'buildbot try'

2005-08-08  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (try): add docs on the
	as-yet-unimplemented Try scheduler

	* buildbot/test/test_buildreq.py: move Scheduling tests out to ..
	* buildbot/test/test_scheduler.py: .. here
	(Scheduling.testTryJobdir): add placeholder test for 'try'

	* buildbot/test/test_status.py (Log.testMerge3): update to match new
	addEntry merging (>=chunkSize) behavior
	(Log.testConsumer): update to handle new callLater(0) behavior

	* buildbot/test/test_web.py: rearrange tests a bit, add test for
	both the MAX_LENGTH bugfix and the resumeProducing hang.

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (LogFileProducer.resumeProducing):
	put off the actual resumeProducing for a moment with
	reactor.callLater(0). This works around a twisted-1.3.0 bug which
	causes large logfiles to hang midway through.

	* buildbot/process/step.py (BuildStep.addCompleteLog): break the
	logfile up into chunks, both to avoid NetstringReceiver.MAX_LENGTH
	and to improve memory usage when streaming the file out to a web
	browser.
	* buildbot/status/builder.py (LogFile.addEntry): change > to >= to
	make this work cleanly

2005-08-03  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/trybuild.py: new file for 'try' utilities
	(getSourceStamp): run in a tree, find out the baserev+patch
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (VCBase.do_getpatch): test it,
	implemented for SVN and Darcs, still working on Arch. I don't know
	how to make CVS work yet.

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo: document the 'buildbot' command-line
	tool, including the not-yet-implemented 'try' feature, and the
	in-flux .buildbot/ options directory.

2005-07-20  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/locks.py: added temporary id() numbers to Lock
	descriptions, to track down a not-really-sharing-the-Lock bug

	* buildbot/test/runutils.py: must import errno, cut-and-paste bug

	* buildbot/test/test_slavecommand.py (ShellBase.failUnlessIn):
	needed for python2.2 compatibility
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py: python2.2 compatibility: generators
	are from the __future__

2005-07-19  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadConfig): give a better error
	message when schedulers use unknown builders

	* buildbot/process/builder.py (Builder.compareToSetup): make sure
	SlaveLock('name') and MasterLock('name') are distinct

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadConfig): oops, sanity-check
	c['schedulers'] in such a way that we can actually accept
	Dependent instances
	* buildbot/test/test_config.py: check it

	* buildbot/scheduler.py (Dependent.listBuilderNames): oops, add
	utility method to *all* the Schedulers
	(Periodic.listBuilderNames): same

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Interlocks): update chapter to match
	reality

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadConfig): Add sanity checks
	to make sure that c['sources'], c['schedulers'], and c['status']
	are all lists of the appropriate objects, and that the Schedulers
	all point to real Builders
	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IScheduler, IUpstreamScheduler): add
	'listBuilderNames' utility method to support this
	* buildbot/scheduler.py: implement the utility method
	* buildbot/test/test_config.py (ConfigTest.testSchedulers): test it

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo: add some @cindex entries

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (Arch.createRepository): set the tla ID
	if it wasn't already set: most tla commands will fail unless one
	has been set.
	(Arch.createRepository): and disable bazaar's revision cache, since
	they cause test failures (the multiple repositories we create all
	interfere with each other through the cache)

	* buildbot/test/test_web.py (WebTest): remove use of deferredResult,
	bring it properly up to date with twisted-2.0 test guidelines

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster): remove references to old
	'interlock' module, this caused a bunch of post-merge test
	failures
	* buildbot/test/test_config.py: same
	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build): same

	* buildbot/test/test_slaves.py: stubs for new test case

	* buildbot/scheduler.py: add test-case-name tag
	* buildbot/test/test_buildreq.py: same

	* buildbot/slave/bot.py (SlaveBuilder.__init__): remove some
	unnecessary init code
	(Bot.remote_setBuilderList): match it

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (@settitle): don't claim version 1.0

	* buildbot/changes/mail.py (parseSyncmail): update comment

	* buildbot/test/test_slavecommand.py: disable Shell tests on
	platforms that don't suport IReactorProcess

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (LogFile): remove the 't' mode from
	all places where we open logfiles. It causes OS-X to open the file
	in some weird mode that that prevents us from mixing reads and
	writes to the same filehandle, which we depend upon to implement
	_generateChunks properly. This change doesn't appear to break
	win32, on which "b" and "t" are treated differently but a missing
	flag seems to be interpreted as "t".

2005-07-18  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (ShellCommand): overhaul
	error-handling code, to try and make timeout/interrupt work
	properly, and make win32 happier
	* buildbot/test/test_slavecommand.py: clean up, stop using
	reactor.iterate, add tests for timeout and interrupt
	* buildbot/test/sleep.py: utility for a new timeout test

	* buildbot/twcompat.py: copy over twisted 1.3/2.0 compatibility
	code from the local-usebranches branch

2005-07-17  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py
	(TwistedReactorsBuildFactory): change the treeStableTimer to 5
	minutes, to match the other twisted BuildFactories, and don't
	excuse failures in c/qt/win32 reactors any more.

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: turn off the 'threadless' and
	'freebsd' builders, since the buildslaves have been unavailable
	for quite a while

2005-07-13  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (VCBase.do_branch): test the new
	build-on-branch feature

	* buildbot/process/step.py (Darcs.__init__): add base_url and
	default_branch arguments, just like SVN
	(Arch.__init__): note that the version= argument is really the
	default branch name

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (SourceBase): keep track of the
	repository+branch that was used for the last checkout in
	SRCDIR/.buildbot-sourcedata . If the contents of this file do not
	match, we clobber the directory and perform a fresh checkout
	rather than trying to do an in-place update. This should protect
	us against trying to get to branch B by doing an update in a tree
	obtained from branch A.
	(CVS.setup): add CVS-specific sourcedata: root, module, and branch
	(SVN.setup): same, just the svnurl
	(Darcs.setup): same, just the repourl
	(Arch.setup): same, arch coordinates (url), version, and
	buildconfig. Also pull the buildconfig from the args dictionary,
	which we weren't doing before, so the build-config was effectively
	disabled.
	(Arch.sourcedirIsUpdateable): don't try to update when we're
	moving to a specific revision: arch can't go backwards, so it is
	safer to just clobber the tree and checkout a new one at the
	desired revision.
	(Bazaar.setup): same sourcedata as Arch

	* buildbot/test/test_dependencies.py (Dependencies.testRun_Fail):
	use maybeWait, to work with twisted-1.3.0 and twcompat
	(Dependencies.testRun_Pass): same

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py: rearrange, cleanup

	* buildbot/twcompat.py: add defer.waitForDeferred and
	utils.getProcessOutputAndValue, so test_vc.py (which uses them)
	can work under twisted-1.3.0 .

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py: rewrite. The sample repositories are
	now created at setUp time. This increases the runtime of the test
	suite considerably (from 91 seconds to 151), but it removes the
	need for an offline tarball, which should solve a problem I've
	seen where the test host has a different version of svn than the
	tarball build host. The new code also validates that mode=update
	really picks up recent commits. This approach will also make it
	easier to test out branches, because the code which creates the VC
	branches is next to the code which uses them. It will also make it
	possible to test some change-notification hooks, by actually
	performing a VC commit and watching to see the ChangeSource get
	notified.

2005-07-12  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (SVN): add branches example
	* docs/Makefile (buildbot.ps): add target for postscript manual

	* buildbot/test/test_dependencies.py: s/test_interlocks/test_locks/ 
	* buildbot/test/test_locks.py: same

	* buildbot/process/step.py (Darcs): comment about default branches

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadConfig): don't look for
	c['interlocks'] in the config file, complain if it is present.
	Scan all locks in c['builders'] to make sure the Locks they use
	are uniquely named.
	* buildbot/test/test_config.py: remove old c['interlocks'] test,
	add some tests to check for non-uniquely-named Locks
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (Patch.doPatch): fix factory.steps,
	since the unique-Lock validation code requires it now

	* buildbot/locks.py: fix test-case-name

	* buildbot/interlock.py: remove old file

2005-07-11  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_interlock.py: rename to..
	* buildbot/test/test_locks.py: .. something shorter

	* buildbot/slave/bot.py (BuildSlave.stopService): newer Twisted
	versions (after 2.0.1) changed internet.TCPClient to shut down the
	connection in stopService. Change the code to handle this
	gracefully.

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build): handle whole-Build locks
	* buildbot/process/builder.py (Builder.compareToSetup): same
	* buildbot/test/test_interlock.py: make tests work

	* buildbot/process/step.py (BuildStep.startStep): complain if a
	Step tries to claim a lock that's owned by its own Build
	(BuildStep.releaseLocks): typo

	* buildbot/locks.py (MasterLock): use ComparableMixin so config
	file reloads don't replace unchanged Builders
	(SlaveLock): same
	* buildbot/test/test_config.py (ConfigTest.testInterlocks):
	rewrite to cover new Locks instead of old c['interlocks']
	* buildbot/test/runutils.py (RunMixin.connectSlaves): remember
	slave2 too


	* buildbot/test/test_dependencies.py (Dependencies.setUp): always
	start the master and connect the buildslave

	* buildbot/process/step.py (FailingDummy.done): finish with a
	FAILURE status rather than raising an exception

	* buildbot/process/base.py (BuildRequest.mergeReasons): don't try to
	stringify a BuildRequest.reason that is None

	* buildbot/scheduler.py (BaseUpstreamScheduler.buildSetFinished):
	minor fix
	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuildSetStatus): implement enough to
	allow scheduler.Dependent to work
	* buildbot/buildset.py (BuildSet): set .reason and .results

	* buildbot/test/test_interlock.py (Locks.setUp): connect both
	slaves, to make the test stop hanging. It still fails, of course,
	because I haven't even started to implement Locks.

	* buildbot/test/runutils.py (RunMixin.connectSlaves): new utility

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Build-Dependencies): redesign the feature
	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IUpstreamScheduler): new Interface
	* buildbot/scheduler.py (BaseScheduler): factor out common stuff
	(Dependent): new class for downstream build dependencies
	* buildbot/test/test_dependencies.py: tests (still failing)

	* buildbot/buildset.py (BuildSet.waitUntilSuccess): minor notes

2005-07-07  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/runutils.py (RunMixin): factored this class out..
	* buildbot/test/test_run.py: .. from here
	* buildbot/test/test_interlock.py: removed old c['interlock'] tests,
	added new buildbot.locks tests (which all hang right now)
	* buildbot/locks.py (SlaveLock, MasterLock): implement Locks
	* buildbot/process/step.py: claim/release per-BuildStep locks

	* docs/Makefile: add 'buildbot.html' target

	* buildbot/process/step.py (CVS.__init__): allow branch=None to be
	interpreted as "HEAD", so that all VC steps can accept branch=None
	and have it mean the "default branch".

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo: add Schedulers, Dependencies, and Locks

2005-07-07  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: update to match current usage

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (System Architecture): comment out the
	image, it doesn't exist yet and just screws up the HTML manual.

2005-07-05  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* debian/.cvsignore: oops, missed one. Removing leftover file.

2005-06-17  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (VCSupport.__init__): svn --version
	changed its output in 1.2.0, don't mistakenly think that the
	subversion we find isn't capable of supporting our tests.

	* debian/*: remove the debian/ directory and its contents, to make
	life easier for the proper Debian maintainer
	* MANIFEST.in: same
	* Makefile (release): same

2005-06-07  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* everything: create a distinct SourceStamp class to replace the
	ungainly 4-tuple, let it handle merging instead of BuildRequest.
	Changed the signature of Source.startVC to include the revision
	information (instead of passing it through self.args). Implement
	branches for SVN (now only Darcs/Git is missing support). Add more
	Scheduler tests.

2005-06-06  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* everything: rearrange build scheduling. Create a new Scheduler
	object (configured in c['schedulers'], which submit BuildSets to a
	set of Builders. Builders can now use multiple slaves. Builds can
	be run on alternate branches, either requested manually or driven
	by changes. This changed some of the Status classes. Interlocks
	are out of service until they've been properly split into Locks
	and Dependencies. treeStableTimer, isFileImportant, and
	periodicBuild have all been moved from the Builder to the
	Scheduler.
	(BuilderStatus.currentBigState): removed the 'waiting' and
	'interlocked' states, removed the 'ETA' argument.

2005-05-24  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/pbutil.py (ReconnectingPBClientFactory): Twisted-1.3
	erroneously abandons the connection (in clientConnectionFailed)
	for non-UserErrors, which means that if we lose the connection due
	to a network problem or a timeout, we'll never try to reconnect.
	Fix this by not upcalling to the buggy parent method. Note:
	twisted-2.0 fixes this, but the function only has 3 lines so it
	makes more sense to copy it than to try and detect the buggyness
	of the parent class. Fixes SF#1207588.

	* buildbot/changes/changes.py (Change.branch): doh! Add a
	class-level attribute to accomodate old Change instances that were
	pickled before 0.6.5 (where .branch was added for new Changes).
	This fixes the exception that occurs when you try to look at an
	old Change (through asHTML).

	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): bump to 0.6.6+ while between
	releases

2005-05-23  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): release 0.6.6

2005-05-23  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* NEWS: update for 0.6.6 release
	* debian/changelog: same

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (start): put the basedir in sys.path
	before starting: this was done by twistd back when we spawned it,
	now that we're importing the pieces and running them in the
	current process, we have to do it ourselves. This allows
	master.cfg to import files from the same directory without
	explicitly manipulating PYTHONPATH. Thanks to Thomas Vander
	Stichele for the catch.
	(Options.opt_version): Add a --version command (actually, just make
	the existing --version command emit Buildbot's version too)

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (HTMLLogFile.upgrade): oops! second
	fix to make this behave like other LogFiles, this time to handle
	existing LogFiles on disk. (add the missing .upgrade method)
	* buildbot/test/test_status.py (Log.testHTMLUpgrade): test it

2005-05-21  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_runner.py (Create.testMaster): match the
	rawstring change in runner.py:masterTAC

	* buildbot/test/test_config.py (ConfigTest.testIRC): skip unless
	TwistedWords is installed
	* buildbot/test/test_status.py: same, with TwistedMail

	* buildbot/master.py: remove old IRC/Waterfall imports (used by
	some old, deprecated, and removed config keys). This should enable
	you to use the base buildbot functionality with Twisted-2.0.0 when
	you don't also have TwistedWeb and TwistedWords installed

2005-05-20  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (run): call sendchange(), not
	do_sendchange(): thus 'buildbot sendchange' was broken in 0.6.5
	(run): call stop("HUP"), not "-HUP", 'buildbot stop' was broken.
	(stop): don't wait for process to die when sending SIGHUP
	(masterTAC): use a rawstring for basedir=, otherwise '\' in the
	directory name gets interpreted, which you don't want
	(slaveTAC): same

	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): bump to 0.6.5+ while between
	releases

2005-05-18  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): Releasing buildbot-0.6.5

2005-05-18  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* README: update for 0.6.5
	* debian/changelog: same

	* buildbot/changes/changes.py: rename tag= to branch=, since
	that's how we're using it, and my design for the upcoming "build a
	specific branch" feature wants it. also, tag= was too CVS-centric
	* buildbot/changes/mail.py (parseSyncmail): same
	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.isBranchImportant): same
	* buildbot/test/test_mailparse.py (Test3.testMsgS4): same
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Attributes of Changes): same

	* NEWS: update tag=, update for upcoming release

2005-05-17  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (stop): actually poll once per
	second, instead of re-killing the poor daemon once per second.
	Sleep briefly (0.1s) before the first poll, since there's a good
	chance we can avoid waiting the full second if the daemon shuts
	down quickly. Also remove the sys.exit() at the end.
	(start): remove the unneighborly sys.exit()

	* Makefile: improve permission-setting to not kick Arch so badly

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (SlaveOptions.optParameters): set a
	default --keepalive=600, since it doesn't hurt very much, and it's
	a hassle to discover that you need it.
	* buildbot/test/test_runner.py (Create.testSlave): test it

	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcStatusBot.buildFinished): Teach the
	IRC bot about EXCEPTION

	* buildbot/status/client.py (PBListener): upcall more correctly

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.allStepsDone): if a step caused
	an exception mark the overall build with EXCEPTION, not SUCCESS

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (makefile_sample): remove the leading
	newline
	* buildbot/status/mail.py (MailNotifier): oops, forgot to upcall
	* Makefile: update some release-related stuff

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (ShellCommand.kill): if somehow this
	gets called when there isn't actually an active process, just end
	the Command instead of blowing up. I don't know how it gets into
	this state, but the twisted win32 buildslave will sometimes hang,
	and when it shakes its head and comes back, it thinks it's still
	running a Command. The next build causes this command to be
	interrupted, but the lack of self.process.pid breaks the interrupt
	attempt.

	* NEWS: document changes since the last release

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (start): change 'buildbot start' to
	look for Makefile.buildbot instead of a bare Makefile . The
	'buildbot start' does not install this file, so you have to
	manually copy it if you want to customize startup behavior.
	(createMaster): change 'buildbot master' command to create
	Makefile.sample instead of Makefile, to create master.cfg.sample
	instead of master.cfg (requiring you to copy it before the
	buildmaster can be started). Both sample files are kept up to
	date, i.e. they are overwritten if they have been changed. The
	'buildbot.tac' file is *not* overwritten, but if the new contents
	don't match the old, a 'buildbot.tac.new' file is created and the
	user is warned. This seems to be a much more sane way to handle
	startup files. Also, don't sys.exit(0) when done, so we can run
	unit tests against it.
	(createSlave): same. Don't overwrite the sample info/ files.
	* buildbot/scripts/sample.mk: remove. the contents were pulled
	into runner.py, since they need to match the behavior of start()
	* setup.py: same
	* MANIFEST.in: same

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Launching the daemons): document it
	* buildbot/test/test_runner.py (Create): test it

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (SetupMixin.failUnlessIn): Add a
	version that can handle string-in-string tests, because otherwise
	python-2.2 fails the tests. It'd be tremendous if Trial's test
	took two strings under 2.2 too.

	* everything: fixed all deprecation warnings when running against
	Twisted-2.0 . (at least all the ones in buildbot code, there are a
	few that come from Twisted itself). This involved putting most of
	the Twisted-version specific code in the new buildbot.twcompat
	module, and creating some abstract base classes in
	buildbot.changes.base and buildbot.status.base (which might be
	useful anyway). __implements__ is a nuisance and requires an ugly
	'if' clause everywhere.

	* buildbot/test/test_status.py (Mail.testMail): add a 0.1 second
	delay before finishing the test: it seems that smtp.sendmail
	doesn't hang up on the server, so we must wait a moment so it can
	hang up on us. This removes the trial warning about an unclean
	reactor.

2005-05-16  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step.py (Source): add 'retry' argument. It is a
	tuple of (delay, repeats).
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (Retry): test it
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Source Checkout): document it
	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (SourceBase): add 'retry' parameter.
	(SourceBase.maybeDoVCRetry): If 'retry' is set, failures in
	doVCFull() are handled by re-trying the checkout (after a delay)
	some number of times.
	(ShellCommand._startCommand): make header lines easier to read

	* buildbot/test/test_web.py (WebTest.tearDown): factor out master
	shutdown
	(WebTest.test_logfile): make sure master gets shut down, silences
	some "unclean reactor" test errors

	* buildbot/test/test_changes.py (Sender.tearDown): spin the
	reactor once after shutdown, something in certain versions of
	Twisted trigger a test failure. 1.3.0 is ok, 2.0.0 fails, 2.0.1pre
	fails, svn-trunk is ok.

	* buildbot/test/test_slavecommand.py (Shell.testShellZ): add a
	second win32 error message

	* buildbot/test/test_run.py (Status.testSlave): be smarter about
	validating the ETA, so the tests don't fail on slow systems

2005-05-15  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (HTMLLogFile): make this behave like
	the new LogFile class, so upgrading works properly
	(LogFileProducer.resumeProducing): survive resumeProducing after
	we've exhausted the chunkGenerator

	* buildbot/test/test_web.py (WebTest.test_logfile): validate HTML
	logs too
	* buildbot/test/test_status.py (Log.testAdd): validate hasContents
	(Log.testUpgrade): same

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (Maintenance): describe how to delete old
	Builds and logs with a cron job.

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (LogFile): revamp LogFiles. Got rid
	of the old non-offline LogFile, added code to upgrade these to
	new-style contents-live-on-disk instances at load time (in a way
	that doesn't invalidate the old Build pickles, so upgrading to
	0.6.5 is not a one-way operation). Got rid of everything related
	to 'stub' builds.
	(LogFile.__init__): create LogFiles with the parent step status,
	the log's name, and a builder-relative filename where it can keep
	the contents on disk.
	(LogFile.hasContents): new method, clients are advised to call it
	before getText or getChunks and friends. If it returns False, the
	log's contents have been deleted and getText() will raise an
	error.
	(LogFile.getChunks): made it a generator
	(LogFile.subscribeConsumer): new method, takes a Twisted-style
	Consumer (except one that takes chunks instead of strings). This
	enables streaming of very large logfiles without storing the whole
	thing in memory.
	(BuildStatus.generateLogfileName): create names like
	12-log-compile-output, with a _0 suffix if required to be unique
	(BuildStatus.upgradeLogfiles): transform any old-style (from 0.6.4
	or earlier) logfiles into new-style ones
	(BuilderStatus): remove everything related to 'stub' builds. There
	is now only one build cache, and we don't strip logs from old
	builds anymore.
	(BuilderStatus.getBuildByNumber): check self.currentBuild too,
	since we no longer fight to keep it in the cache

	* buildbot/status/html.py (TextLog.render_GET): use a
	ChunkConsumer to stream the log entries efficiently.
	(ChunkConsumer): wrapper which consumes chunks and writes
	formatted HTML.

	* buildbot/test/test_twisted.py (Parse.testParse): use a
	LogFile-like object instead of a real one

	* buildbot/test/test_status.py (MyLog): handle new LogFile code
	(Log.testMerge3): validate more merge behavior
	(Log.testChunks): validate LogFile.getChunks
	(Log.testUpgrade): validate old-style LogFile upgrading
	(Log.testSubscribe): validate LogFile.subscribe
	(Log.testConsumer): validate LogFile.subscribeConsumer

	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IStatusLogStub): remove
	(IStatusLog.subscribeConsumer): new method
	(IStatusLog.hasContents): new method
	(IStatusLogConsumer): describes things passed to subscribeConsumer

	* buildbot/status/html.py (StepBox.getBox): Don't offer an href to
	the log contents if it does not have any contents.
	(StatusResourceBuildStep.body): same
	(StatusResourceBuildStep.getChild): give a 404 for empty logs

2005-05-14  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_web.py (WebTest.test_logfile): add 5-second
	timeouts to try and make the windows metabuildslave not hang

2005-05-13  Mike Taylor  <bear@code-bear.com>

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (rmdirRecursive): added a check
	to ensure the path passed into rmdirRecursive actually exists.
	On win32 a non-existant path would generate an exception.

2005-05-13  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (rmdirRecursive): replacement for
	shutil.rmtree which behaves correctly on windows in the face of
	files that you have to chmod before deleting. Thanks to Bear at
	the OSAF for the routine.
	(SourceBase.doClobber): use rmdirRecursive

2005-05-12  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (OfflineLogFile.getChunks): have this
	method generate chunks instead of returning a big list. This
	allows the same method to be used for both old LogFile and new
	OfflineLogFile.
	(OfflineLogFile.getText): use the generator
	(OfflineLogFile.subscribe): same
	* buildbot/status/html.py (TextLog.resumeProducing): same
	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IStatusLog.getChunks): document it

	* buildbot/test/test_web.py (WebTest.test_logfile): Add a test to
	point out that OfflineLogFile does not currently work with
	html.Waterfall . Fixing this is high-priority.

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (start): add --logfile=twistd.log, since
	apparently windows defaults to using stdout

	* buildbot/test/test_slavecommand.py (Shell.testShellZ): log a
	better message on failure so I can figure out the win32 problem

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (ShellCommand._startCommand): update
	log messages to include more useful copies of the command being
	run, the argv array, and the child command's environment.
	(Git.doVCFull): update cg-close usage, patch from Brandon Philips.

2005-05-11  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* setup.py: oops, install debug.glade so 'buildbot debugclient'
	will actually work
	* Makefile: update the deb-snapshot version

	* docs/buildbot.texinfo: move all .xhtml docs into a new
	.texinfo-format document, adding a lot of material in the process.
	This is starting to look like a real user's manual. Removed all
	the Lore-related files: *.xhtml, *.css, template.tpl .
	* docs/Makefile: simple makefile to run 'makeinfo'
	* buildbot/scripts/sample.cfg: rearrange slightly
	* MANIFEST.in: include .info and .textinfo, don't include *.xhtml

2005-05-10  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (start): Twisted-1.3.0 used a
	different name for the internal twistw module, handle it.

	* MANIFEST.in: we deleted plugins.tml, so stop shipping it
	* setup.py: .. and stop trying to install it

	* buildbot/process/step.py (Git): added support for 'cogito' (aka
	'git'), the new linux kernel VC system (http://kernel.org/git/).
	Thanks to Brandon Philips for the patch.
	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (Git): same

2005-05-06  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (OfflineLogFile): replace the default
	LogFile with a form that appends its new contents to a disk file
	as they arrive. The complete log data is never kept in RAM. This
	is the first step towards handling very large (100MB+) logfiles
	without choking quite so badly. (The other half is
	producer/consumer on the HTML pages).
	(BuildStepStatus.addLog): use OfflineLogFile by default
	(BuildStatus.getLogfileName): helper code to give the
	OfflineLogFile a filename to work with

	* buildbot/test/test_status.py (Results.testAddResults): update
	tests to handle new asserts
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (Patch.doPatch): same
	* buildbot/test/test_steps.py (BuildStep.setUp): same

2005-05-05  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (start): if there is no Makefile,
	launch the app by importing twistd's internals and calling run(),
	rather than spawning a new twistd process. This stands a much
	better chance of working under windows.
	(stop): kill the process with os.kill instead of spawning
	/bin/kill, again to reduce the number of external programs which
	windows might not have in the PATH. Also wait up to 5 seconds for
	the process to go away, allowing things like 'buildbot stop;
	buildbot start' to be reliable in the face of slow shutdowns.

	* buildbot/master.py (Dispatcher.__getstate__): remove old
	.tap-related methods
	(BuildMaster.__getstate__): same
	(makeService): same
	* buildbot/slave/bot.py (makeService): same
	(Options.longdesc): same
	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py: copy over some old mktap option text

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (masterTAC): stop using mktap.
	'buildbot master' now creates a buildbot.tac file, so there is no
	longer a create-instance/save/reload sequence. mktap is dead, long
	live twistd -y.
	* buildbot/scripts/sample.mk: use twistd -y, not -f
	* buildbot/test/test_config.py: remove mktap-based test
	* buildbot/bb_tap.py, buildbot/plugins.tml: delete old files
	* README: don't reference mktap

	* docs/source.xhtml: document some of the attributes that Changes
	might have

	* docs/steps.xhtml (Bazaar): document the Bazaar checkout step

	* general: merge in Change(tag=) patch from Thomas Vander Stichele.
	[org.apestaart@thomas--buildbot/buildbot--cvstag--0-dev--patch-2]
	* buildbot/changes/changes.py (Change)
	* buildbot/changes/mail.py (parseSyncmail)
	* buildbot/test/test_mailparse.py (Test3.getNoPrefix)
	(Test3.testMsgS5)
	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.isTagImportant)
	(Build.addChange)


2005-05-04  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/clients/sendchange.py (Sender.send): tear down the PB
	connection after sending the change, so that unit tests don't
	complain about sockets being left around

	* buildbot/status/html.py (WaterfallStatusResource.body): fix
	exception in phase=0 rendering
	* buildbot/test/test_web.py (WebTest.test_waterfall): test it

	* buildbot/changes/dnotify.py (DNotify.__init__): remove debug msg

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadConfig): finally remove
	deprecated config keys: webPortnum, webPathname, irc, manholePort,
	and configuring builders with tuples.
	* buildbot/test/test_config.py: stop testing compatibility with
	deprecated config keys
	* buildbot/test/test_run.py: same

2005-05-03  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* contrib/arch_buildbot.py: survive if there are no logfiles
	(username): just use a string, os.getlogin isn't reliable

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (sendchange): oops, fix the command
	so 'buildbot sendchange' actually works. The earlier test only
	covered the internal (non-reactor-running) form.

	* contrib/arch_buildbot.py: utility that can run as an Arch hook
	script to notify the buildmaster about changes

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (sendchange): new command to send a
	change to a buildbot.changes.pb.PBChangeSource receiver.
	* buildbot/test/test_changes.py (Sender): test it

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.startService): mark .readConfig
	after any reading of the config file, not just when we do it in
	startService. This makes some tests a bit cleaner.

	* buildbot/changes/pb.py: add some log messages

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.startBuild): fix a bug that
	caused an exception when the build terminated in the very first
	step.
	(Build.stepDone): let steps return a status of EXCEPTION. This
	terminates the build right away, and sets the build's overall
	status to EXCEPTION too.
	* buildbot/process/step.py (BuildStep.failed): return a status of
	EXCEPTION when that is what has happened.

	* buildbot/process/step.py (Arch.computeSourceRevision): finally
	implement this, allowing Arch-based projects to get precise
	checkouts instead of always using the latest code
	(Bazaar): create variant of Arch to let folks use baz instead of
	tla. Requires a new buildslave too.
	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (Arch): add 'revision' argument
	(Bazaar): create variant of Arch that uses baz instead of tla.
	Remove the code that extracts the archive name from the
	register-archive output, since baz doesn't provide it, and require
	the user provide both the archive name and its location.
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (VC.testBazaar): added tests

2005-05-02  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/scripts/sample.cfg: improve docs for c['buildbotURL'],
	thanks to Nick Trout.

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (Maker.makefile): chmod before edit,
	deals better with source Makefile coming from a read-only CVS
	checkout. Thanks to Nick Trout for the catch.

	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): bump to 0.6.4+ while between
	releases

2005-04-28  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): Releasing buildbot-0.6.4

	* debian/changelog: update for 0.6.4

2005-04-28  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* README.w32: add a checklist of steps for getting buildbot
	running on windows.
	* MANIFEST.in: include it in the tarball

	* NEWS: update

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.upgradeToVersion3): deal with
	broken .tap files from 0.6.3 by getting rid of .services,
	.namedServices, and .change_svc at load time.

2005-04-27  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* NEWS: update in preparation for new release

	* buildbot/test/test_config.py (Save.testSave): don't pull in
	twisted.scripts.twistd, we don't need it and it isn't for windows
	anyway.

	* buildbot/changes/changes.py (ChangeMaster.saveYourself):
	accomodate win32 which can't do atomic-rename

2005-04-27  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_run.py (Disconnect.testBuild2): crank up some
	timeouts to help the slow metabuildbot not flunk them so much
	(Disconnect.testBuild3): same
	(Disconnect.testBuild4): same
	(Disconnect.testInterrupt): same

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadChanges): fix change_svc
	setup, it was completely broken for new buildmasters (those which
	did not have a 'change.pck' already saved. Thanks to Paul Warren
	for catching this (embarrassing!) bug.
	(Dispatcher.__getstate__): don't save our registered avatar
	factories, since they'll be re-populated when the config file is
	re-read.
	(BuildMaster.__init__): add a dummy ChangeMaster, used only by
	tests (since the real mktap-generated BuildMaster doesn't save
	this attribute).
	(BuildMaster.__getstate__): don't save any service children,
	they'll all be re-populated when the config file is re-read.
	* buildbot/test/test_config.py (Save.testSave): test for this

2005-04-26  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/buildbot.png: use a new, smaller (16x16) icon image,
	rendered with Blender.. looks a bit nicer.
	* buildbot/docs/images/icon.blend: add the Blender file for it

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (ShellCommand._startCommand): prepend
	'cmd.exe' (or rather os.environ['COMSPEC']) to the argv list when
	running under windows. This appears to be the best way to allow
	BuildSteps to do something normal like 'trial -v buildbot.test' or
	'make foo' and still expect it to work. The idea is to make the
	BuildSteps look as much like what a developer would type when
	compiling or testing the tree by hand. This approach probably has
	problems when there are spaces in the arguments, so if you've got
	windows buildslaves, you'll need to pay close attention to your
	commands.

	* buildbot/status/html.py (WaterfallStatusResource.body): add the
	timezone to the timestamp column.
	* buildbot/test/test_web.py (WebTest.test_waterfall): test it

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (loadOptions): do something sane for
	windows, I think. We use %APPDATA%/buildbot instead of
	~/.buildbot, but we still search everywhere from the current
	directory up to the root for a .buildbot/ subdir. The "is it under
	$HOME" security test was replaced with "is it owned by the current
	user", which is only performed under posix.
	* buildbot/test/test_runner.py (Options.testFindOptions): update
	tests to match. The "is it owned by the current user" check is
	untested. The test has been re-enabled for windows.

	* buildbot/test/test_slavecommand.py (Shell.checkOutput): replace
	any "\n" in the expected output with the platform-specific line
	separator. Make this separator "\r\n" on PTYs under unix, they
	seem to do that and I don't know why

	* buildbot/test/test_runner.py (Options.optionsFile): disable on
	windows for now, I don't know what ~/.buildbot/ should mean there.

	* buildbot/test/test_run.py (BuilderNames.testGetBuilderNames):
	win32 compatibility, don't use "/tmp"
	(Basedir.testChangeBuilddir): remove more unixisms

2005-04-26  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_control.py (Force.rmtree): python2.2
	compatibility, apparently its shutil.rmtree ignore_errors=
	argument is ignored.
	* buildbot/test/test_run.py (Run.rmtree): same
	(RunMixin.setUp): same

	* buildbot/test/test_runner.py (make): python2.2 has os.sep but
	not os.path.sep

	* buildbot/test/test_twisted.py (Parse.failUnlessIn): 2.2 has no
	'substring in string' operator, must use string.find(substr)!=-1
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (Patch.failUnlessIn): same
	* buildbot/test/test_web.py (WebTest.failUnlessIn): same

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (loadOptions): add code to search for
	~/.buildbot/, a directory with things like 'options', containing
	defaults for various 'buildbot' subcommands. .buildbot/ can be in
	the current directory, your $HOME directory, or anywhere
	inbetween, as long as you're somewhere inside your home directory.
	(debugclient): look in ~/.buildbot/options for master and passwd
	(statuslog): look in ~/.buildbot/options for 'masterstatus'
	* buildbot/test/test_runner.py (Options.testFindOptions): test it

	* buildbot/status/client.py (makeRemote): new approach to making
	IRemote(None) be None, which works under Twisted-2.0
	* buildbot/test/test_status.py (Client.testAdaptation): test it

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (Status.builderAdded): when loading a
	pickled BuilderStatus in from disk, set its name after loading.
	The config file might have changed its name (but not its
	directory) while it wasn't looking.
	
	* buildbot/process/builder.py (Builder.attached): always return a
	Deferred, even if the builder was already attached
	* buildbot/test/test_run.py (Basedir.testChangeBuilddir): test it

2005-04-25  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcStatusBot.buildFinished): fix a
	category-related exception when announcing a build has finished

	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceChanges.body): oops, don't
	reference no-longer-existent changemaster.sources
	* buildbot/test/test_web.py (WebTest.test_waterfall): test for it

	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): bump to 0.6.3+ while between
	releases

2005-04-25  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): Releasing buildbot-0.6.3

	* debian/changelog: update for 0.6.3

2005-04-25  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* MANIFEST.in: make sure debug.glade is in the tarball

	* README (REQUIREMENTS): list necessary Twisted-2.0 packages

	* NEWS: update for the imminent 0.6.3 release

	* buildbot/status/html.py (HtmlResource.content): make the
	stylesheet <link> always point at "buildbot.css".
	(StatusResource.getChild): map "buildbot.css" to a static.File
	containing whatever css= argument was provided to Waterfall()
	(Waterfall): provide the "classic" css as the default.
	* docs/waterfall.classic.css: move default CSS from here ..
	* buildbot/status/classic.css: .. to here

	* MANIFEST.in: make sure classic.css is included in the tarball
	* setup.py: and that it is installed too, under buildbot/status/

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster): oops, set .change_svc=None at
	the module level, because buildbot.tap files from 0.6.2 don't have
	it in their attribute dictionary.

	* buildbot/slave/bot.py (Bot.startService): make sure the basedir
	really exists at startup, might save some confusion somewhere.

2005-04-24  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* docs/waterfall.classic.css:
	  add a stylesheet that's almost the same as the "classic"
	  buildbot style

	* buildbot/status/builder.py:
	  add EXCEPTION as a result - this is a problem for the bot
	  maintainer, not a build problem for the changers
	* buildbot/process/step.py:
	  use EXCEPTION instead of FAILURE for exceptions
	* buildbot/status/html.py:
	  add build_get_class to get a class out of a build/buildstep
	  finish naming the classes
	  split out sourceNames to changeNames and builderNames so we
	  can style them separately
	* docs/config.xhtml:
	  finish documenting classes as they are right now

	* buildbot/status/html.py:
	  name the classes as we agreed on IRC
	* docs/config.xhtml:
	  and document them

	* buildbot/status/html.py:
	  same for cssclass->class_

	* buildbot/status/html.py:
	  as decided on IRC, use class_ for the "class" attribute to not
	  conflict with the class keyword, and clean up the messy **{} stuff.

	* buildbot/status/mail.py:
	  put back "builders" argument, and fix docstring, because the
	  code *ignores* builders listed in this argument

	* buildbot/process/builder.py:
	  remove FIXME notes - category is now indeed a cvar of BuilderStatus

	* docs/config.xhtml:
	  describe the category argument for builders

	* buildbot/status/builder.py:
	  Fix a silly bug due to merging

	* buildbot/process/builder.py:
	  remove category from the process Builder ...
	* buildbot/status/builder.py:
	  ... and add it to BuilderStatus instead.
	  Set category on unpickled builder statuses, they might not have it.
	* buildbot/master.py:
	  include category when doing builderAdded
	* buildbot/status/mail.py:
	  return None instead of self for builders we are not interested in.
	* buildbot/test/test_run.py:
	  fix a bug due to only doing deferredResult on "dummy" waiting
	* buildbot/test/test_status.py:
	  add checks for the Mail IStatusReceiver returning None or self

	* buildbot/status/html.py:
	  fix testsuite by prefixing page title with BuildBot

	* buildbot/status/builder.py:
	  have .category in builder status ...
	* buildbot/process/builder.py:
	  ... and set it from Builder
	* buildbot/status/html.py:
	  make .css a class variable 
	* buildbot/test/test_status.py:
	  write more tests to cover our categories stuff ...
	* buildbot/status/mail.py:
	  ... and fix the bug that this uncovered

	* buildbot/changes/mail.py:
	* buildbot/changes/pb.py:

	  add test-case-name at the top of a whole set of files

	* buildbot/status/builder.py:
	  keep order of addition when getting builder names
	* buildbot/status/words.py:
	* buildbot/test/test_run.py:
	  add test for getBuilderNames

	* buildbot/process/base.py:
	* buildbot/process/step.py:
	* buildbot/status/builder.py:
	* buildbot/status/html.py:
	  make buildbot css-able
	  replace the color code for purple with purple, don't understand
	  why it wasn't purple to start with

	* buildbot/status/words.py:
	  ok, so it doesn't look like BuilderStatus.remote is still valid.
	  Use what waterfall uses instead.

	* buildbot/interfaces.py:
	* buildbot/status/builder.py:
	* buildbot/status/html.py:
	* buildbot/status/mail.py:
	* buildbot/status/words.py:
	* buildbot/test/test_run.py:
	  use categories everywhere and make it be a list.  More sensible
	  for the future.  Also make words actually respect this in
	  buildFinished.

	* buildbot/interfaces.py:
	  add category argument to getBuilderNames
	* buildbot/process/builder.py:

	  add "builders=" to __init__ of status clients so they can
	  limit themselves to the given list of builders to report on

	* buildbot/status/html.py: set the title to the product name

2005-04-23  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* buildbot/interfaces.py:
	* buildbot/status/builder.py:
	  more documentation.  Hm, not sure if ChangeLog entries make sense
	  here...

2005-04-23  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (SetupMixin.do_vc): increase timeouts

	* buildbot/test/test_slavecommand.py (Shell): increase timeouts

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py: make 'statuslog' and 'statusgui' be
	the sub-commands that log buildmaster status to stdout and to a
	GUI window, respectively.

	* buildbot/clients/gtkPanes.py: overhaul. basic two-row
	functionality is working again, but all the step-status and ETA
	stuff is missing. Commented out a lot of code pending more
	overhaul work.

	* buildbot/status/client.py: make sure that IRemote(None) is None

	* buildbot/changes/changes.py: import defer, oops
	(ChangeMaster): remove the .sources list, rely upon the fact that
	MultiServices can be treated as sequences of their children. This
	cleans up the add/remove ChangeSource routines a lot, as we keep
	exactly one list of the current sources instead of three.

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.__init__): remove .sources, set
	up an empty ChangeMaster at init time.
	(BuildMaster.loadChanges): if there are changes to be had from
	disk, replace self.change_svc with the new ones. If not, keep
	using the empty ChangeMaster set up in __init__.
	(BuildMaster.loadConfig_Sources): use list(self.change_svc)
	instead of a separate list, makes the code a bit cleaner.
	* buildbot/test/test_config.py (ConfigTest.testSimple): match it
	(ConfigTest.testSources): same, also wait for loadConfig to finish.
	Extend the test to make sure we can get rid of the sources when
	we're done.

2005-04-22  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (Maker.mkinfo): create the info/admin
	and info/host files when making the slave directory

	* buildbot/test/test_run.py (RunMixin.shutdownSlave): remove the
	whendone= argument, just return the Deferred and let the caller do
	what they want with it.
	(Disconnect.testBuild1): wait for shutdownSlave
	(Basedir.testChangeBuilddir): new test to make sure changes to the
	builddir actually get propagated to the slave

	* buildbot/slave/bot.py (SlaveBuilder.setBuilddir): use an
	explicit method, rather than passing the builddir in __init__ .
	Make sure to update self.basedir too, this was broken before.
	(Bot.remote_setBuilderList): use b.setBuilddir for both new
	builders and for ones that have just had their builddir changed.
	(BotFactory): add a class-level .perspective attribute, so
	BuildSlave.waitUntilDisconnected won't get upset when the
	connection hasn't yet been established
	(BuildSlave.__init__): keep track of the bot.Bot instance, so
	tests can reach through it to inspect the SlaveBuilders

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.buildException): explain the
	log.err with a log.msg
	* buildbot/process/builder.py (Builder.startBuild): same
	(Builder._startBuildFailed): improve error message

	* buildbot/pbutil.py (RBCP.failedToGetPerspective): if the failure
	occurred because we lost the brand-new connection, retry instead
	of giving up. If not, it's probably an authorization failure, and
	it makes sense to stop trying. Make sure we log.msg the reason
	that we're log.err'ing the failure, otherwise test failures are
	really hard to figure out.

	* buildbot/master.py: change loadConfig() to return a Deferred
	that doesn't fire until the change has been fully implemented.
	This means any connected slaves have been updated with the new
	builddir. This change makes it easier to test the code which
	actually implements this builddir-updating.
	(BotPerspective.addBuilder): return Deferred
	(BotPerspective.removeBuilder): same
	(BotPerspective.attached): same
	(BotPerspective._attached): same. finish with remote_print before
	starting the getSlaveInfo, instead of doing them in parallel
	(BotPerspective.list_done): same
	(BotMaster.removeSlave): same. Fix the typo that meant we weren't
	actually calling slave.disconnect()
	(BotMaster.addBuilder): same
	(BotMaster.removeBuilder): same
	(BuildMaster.loadConfig): same
	(BuildMaster.loadConfig_Slaves): same
	(BuildMaster.loadConfig_Sources): same
	(BuildMaster.loadConfig_Builders): same
	(BuildMaster.loadConfig_status): same

	* buildbot/changes/changes.py (ChangeMaster.removeSource): return
	a Deferred that fires when the source is finally removed

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (SourceBase.doClobber): when removing
	the previous tree on win32, where we have to do it synchronously,
	make sure we return a Deferred anyway.
	(SourceBase.doCopy): same

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (statusgui): use the text client for
	now, while I rewrite the Gtk one
	* buildbot/clients/base.py: strip out old code, leaving just the
	basic print-message-on-event functionality. I also remove the
	ReconnectingPBClientFactory, but it does at least quit when it
	loses the connection instead of going silent

2005-04-21  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* Makefile: minor tweaks

	* NEWS: point out deprecation warnings, new features for
	/usr/bin/buildbot

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadConfig): emit
	DeprecationWarnings for Builders defined with tuples. Rearrange
	code to facility removal of deprecated configuration keys in the
	next release.

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (createMaster,createSlave): rewrite
	'buildbot' command to put a little Makefile in the target that
	helps you re-create the buildbot.tap file, start or stop the
	master/slave, and reconfigure (i.e. SIGHUP) the master. Also chmod
	all the files 0600, since they contain passwords.
	(start): if there is a Makefile, and /usr/bin/make exists, use
	'make start' in preference to a raw twistd command. This lets
	slave admins put things like PYTHONPATH variables in their
	Makefiles and have them still work when the slave is started with
	'buildbot start ~/slave/foo'. The test is a bit clunky, it would
	be nice to first try the 'make' command and only fall back to
	twistd if it fails. TODO: the Makefile's "start" command does not
	add the --reactor=win32 argument when running under windows.
	(Options.debugclient, Options.statusgui): add sub-commands to launch
	the debug client (formerly in contrib/debugclient.py) and the
	Gtk status application (currently broken)
	* buildbot/clients/debug.py: move from contrib/debugclient.py
	* buildbot/clients/debug.glade: same

	* buildbot/test/test_trial.py: remove it. This requires some
	functionality out of Twisted that isn't there yet, and until then
	having it around just confuses things.

	* buildbot/test/test_slavecommand.py (Shell): test both with and
	without PTYs, and make sure that command output is properly
	interleaved in the with-PTY case. I think the without-PTY test
	should pass on windows, where we never use PTYs anyway.

2005-04-20  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* README (REQUIREMENTS): mention Twisted-2.0.0 compatibility

	* MANIFEST.in: add epyrun, gen-reference, buildbot.png

	* NEWS: start creating entries for the next release

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (ShellCommand.__init__): use os.pathsep

	* buildbot/test/test_web.py (WebTest.test_webPortnum): add timeout
	(WebTest.test_webPathname): same
	(WebTest.test_webPathname_port): same
	(WebTest.test_waterfall): use the default favicon rather than
	rooting around the filesystem for it. Open the expected-icon file
	in binary mode, to make win32 tests happier (thanks to Nick Trout
	for the catch)
	* buildbot/status/html.py (buildbot_icon): win32 portability

	* buildbot/test/test_slavecommand.py (SlaveCommandTestCase.testShellZ):
	win32-compatibility fixes from Nick Trout, the "file not found" message
	is different under windows
	(FakeSlaveBuilder.__init__): clean up setup a bit
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (VCSupport.__init__): win32: use os.pathsep

2005-04-19  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (SetupMixin.setUpClass): fix the
	skip-if-repositories-are-unavailable test to not kill the trial
	that comes with Twisted-1.3.0

	* setup.py: install buildbot.png icon file when installing code

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (ShellCommand._startCommand): log the
	environment used by the command, at least on the child side.

	* buildbot/status/html.py (TextLog.pauseProducing): add a note,
	this method needs to be added and implemented because it gets
	called under heavy load. I don't quite understand the
	producer/consumer API enough to write it.
	(StatusResource.getChild): add a resource for /favicon.ico
	(Waterfall.__init__): add favicon= argument
	* buildbot/test/test_web.py (WebTest.test_waterfall): test it
	(WebTest.test_webPortnum): stop using deprecated 'webPortnum'
	(WebTest.test_webPathname): same
	(WebTest.test_webPathname_port): same
	* docs/config.xhtml: mention favicon=
	* buildbot/buildbot.png: add a default icon, dorky as it is

2005-04-17  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* general: try to fix file modes on all .py files: a+r, a-x,
	but let buildbot/clients/*.py be +x since they're tools

	* docs/epyrun (addMod): when an import fails, say why

	* Makefile: Add a 'docs' target, hack on the PYTHONPATH stuff

2005-04-17  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* buildbot/process/builder.py:
	* buildbot/process/interlock.py:
	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py:
	* buildbot/process/step.py:
	  BuildProcess -> Build, as it looks like that's what happened
	* buildbot/process/base.py:
	* buildbot/process/factory.py:
	  update epydoc stuff

2005-04-17  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py (QuickTwistedBuildFactory):
	update compile command to accomodate the Twisted split.. now
	instead of './setup.py build_ext -i', you do './setup.py all
	build_ext -i', to run build_ext over all sub-projects.
	(FullTwistedBuildFactory): same
	(TwistedReactorsBuildFactory): same

	* buildbot/status/html.py (TextLog.finished): null out self.req
	when we're done, otherwise the reference cycle of TextLog to .req
	to .notifications to a Deferred to TextLog.stop keeps them from
	being collected, and consumes a huge (610MB on pyramid at last
	check) amount of memory.

2005-04-11  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (VCSupport.__init__): use abspath() to
	normalize the VC-repository location.. makes SVN happier with
	certain test environments.

	* buildbot/process/step.py (RemoteShellCommand.__init__): let each
	RemoteShellCommand gets its own .env dictionary, so that code in
	start() doesn't mutate the original. I think this should fix the
	step_twisted.Trial problem where multiple identical components
	kept getting added to PYTHONPATH= over and over again.

	* general: merge org.apestaart@thomas/buildbot--doc--0--patch-3,
	adding epydoc-format docstrings to many classes. Thanks to Thomas
	Vander Stichele for the patches.
	* docs/epyrun, docs/gen-reference: add epydoc-generating tools
	* buildbot/status/mail.py, buildbot/process/step_twisted.py: same
	* buildbot/slave/bot.py, commands.py, registry.py: same

2005-04-05  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (SourceBase.doCopy): use cp -p to
	preserve timestamps, helps incremental builds of large trees.
	Patch from Rene Rivera.

	* buildbot/slave/bot.py (SlaveBuilder.commandComplete): oops, log
	'failure' and not the non-existent 'why'. Thanks to Rene Rivera
	for the catch.

2005-04-03  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadConfig): only call exec()
	with one dict, apparently exec has some scoping bugs when used
	with both global/local dicts. Thanks to Nathaniel Smith for the
	catch.

2005-04-02  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (countFailedTests): the new
	trial in Twisted-2.0 emits a slightly different status line than
	old trial ("PASSED.." instead of "OK.."). Handle it so we don't
	mistakenly think the test count is unparseable.
	(Trial.start): note that for some reason each build causes another
	copy of self.testpath to be prepended to PYTHONPATH. This needs to
	be fixed but I'm not sure quite where the problem is.

2005-04-01  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_run.py (Run.testMaster): change some uses of
	deferredResult to avoid hangs/warnings under twisted-2.0
	(RunMixin.tearDown): same
	(RunMixin.shutdownSlave): same
	(Disconnect.testIdle1): same
	(Disconnect.testBuild2): same: wait one second after the build
	finishes for test to really be done.. this should be cleaned up to
	avoid wasting that second. Builder.detach uses a callLater(0),
	either that should be done in-line (something else needed that
	behavior), or it should return a Deferred that fires when the
	builder is really offline.
	(Disconnect.testBuild3): same
	(Disconnect.testDisappear): same

	* buildbot/test/test_web.py: rearrange server-setup and teardown
	code to remove unclean-reactor warnings from twisted-2.0

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py: rearrange probe-for-VC-program routine
	so the tests don't hang under twisted-2.0

2005-03-31  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/slave/bot.py (Bot.remote_setBuilderList): fix typo that
	caused a warning each time the master changed our set of builders

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuildStatus.saveYourself): under
	w32, don't unlink the file unless it already exists. Thanks to
	Baptiste Lepilleur for the catch.
	(BuilderStatus.saveYourself): same

2005-02-01  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/html.py (TextLog.getChild): use a /text child
	URL, such as http://foo.com/svn-hello/builds/1/test/0/text instead
	of http://foo.com/svn-hello/builds/1/test/0 , to retrieve the
	logfile as text/plain (no markup, no headers). This replaces the
	previous scheme (which used an ?text=1 argument), and gets us back
	to a relative link (which works better when the buildbot lives
	behind another web server, such as Apache configured as a reverse
	proxy). Thanks to Gerald Combs for spotting the problem.

	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): bump to 0.6.2+ while between
	releases

2004-12-13  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): Releasing buildbot-0.6.2

	* debian/changelog: update for 0.6.2
	* NEWS: finalize for 0.6.2

2004-12-11  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* NEWS: bring it up to date

	* buildbot/slave/bot.py (BotFactory): revamp keepalive/lost-master
	detection code. Require some sign of life from the buildmaster
	every BotFactory.keepaliveInterval seconds. Provoke this
	indication at BotFactory.keepaliveTimeout seconds before the
	deadline by sending a keepalive request. We don't actually care if
	that request is answered in a timely fashion, what we care about
	is that .activity() is called before the deadline. .activity() is
	triggered by any PB message from the master (including an ack to
	one of the slave's status-update messages). With this new scheme,
	large status messages over slow pipes are OK, as long as any given
	message can be sent (and thus acked) within .keepaliveTimeout
	seconds (which defaults to 30).
	(SlaveBuilder.remote_startCommand): record activity
	(SlaveBuilder.ackUpdate): same
	(SlaveBuilder.ackComplete): same
	(BotFactory.gotPerspective): same
	* buildbot/test/test_run.py (Disconnect.testSlaveTimeout): test it

2004-12-09  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceBuilder.getChild): remove
	debug message

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (Trial._commandComplete):
	update self.cmd when we start the 'cat test.log' transfer. Without
	this, we cannot interrupt the correct RemoteCommand when we lose
	the connection.

	* buildbot/process/step.py (RemoteCommand.interrupt): don't bother
	trying to tell the slave to stop the command if we're already
	inactive, or if we no longer have a .remote

	* buildbot/process/builder.py (Builder._detached): don't let an
	exception in currentBuild.stopBuild() prevent the builder from
	being marked offline

2004-12-07  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcStatusBot.getBuilder): catch the
	KeyError that happens when you ask for a non-existent Builder, and
	translate it into a UsageError.

	* buildbot/test/test_run.py (Disconnect.testBuild4): validate that
	losing the slave in the middle of a remote step is handled too

	* buildbot/process/step.py (ShellCommand.interrupt): 'reason' can
	be a Failure, so be sure to stringify it before using it as the
	contents of the 'interrupt' logfile
	(RemoteCommand.interrupt): use stringified 'why' in
	remote_interruptCommand too, just in case

2004-12-06  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (Arch.doVCUpdate): use 'tla replay'
	instead of 'tla update', which is more efficient in case we've
	missed a couple of patches since the last update.

	* debian/changelog: update for previous (0.6.1) release. Obviously
	this needs to be handled better.

2004-12-05  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* NEWS: update for stuff since last release

	* buildbot/master.py (DebugPerspective.attached): return 'self', to
	match the maybeDeferred change in Dispatcher.requestAvatar
	* buildbot/changes/pb.py (ChangePerspective.attached): same
	* buildbot/status/client.py (StatusClientPerspective.attached): same
	* buildbot/process/builder.py (Builder._attached3): same
	* buildbot/pbutil.py (NewCredPerspective.attached): same

	* buildbot/status/html.py (WaterfallStatusResource.phase2): Add
	the date to the top-most box, if it is not the same as today's
	date.

	* docs/slave.xhtml: provide a buildslave setup checklist

	* docs/source.xhtml (Arch): correct terminology

2004-12-04  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_slavecommand.py: use sys.executable instead
	of hard-coding 'python' for child commands, might help portability

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: update to current usage

	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcStatusBot.command_STOP): add a
	'stop build' command to the IRC bot

	* buildbot/master.py (Dispatcher.requestAvatar): remove debug
	message that broke PBChangeSource

	* buildbot/slave/bot.py: clean up shutdown/lose-master code
	(SlaveBuilder): make some attributes class-level, remove the old
	"update queue" which existed to support resuming a build after the
	master connection was lost. Try to reimplement that feature later.
	(SlaveBuilder.stopCommand): clear self.command when the
	SlaveCommand finishes, so that we don't try to kill a leftover one
	at shutdown time.
	(SlaveBuilder.commandComplete): same, merge with commandFailed and
	.finishCommand

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (SourceBase): set self.command for
	all VC commands, so they can be interrupted.

2004-12-03  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/master.py: clean up slave-handling code, to handle
	slave-disconnect and multiple-connect better
	(BotPerspective): make these long-lasting, exactly one per bot
	listed in the config file.
	(BotPerspective.attached): if a slave connects while an existing
	one appears to still be connected, disconnect the old one first.
	(BotPerspective.disconnect): new method to forcibly disconnect a
	buildslave. Use some hacks to empty the transmit buffer quickly to
	avoid the long (20-min?) TCP timeout that could occur if the old
	slave has dropped off the net.
	(BotMaster): Keep persistent BotPerspectives in .slaves, let them
	own their own SlaveStatus objects. Remove .attached/.detached, add
	.addSlave/.removeSlave, treat slaves like Builders (config file
	parsing sends deltas to the BotMaster). Inform the slave
	instances, i.e. the BotPerspective, about addBuilder and
	removeBuilder.
	(BotMaster.getPerspective): turns into a single dict lookup
	(Dispatcher.requestAvatar): allow .attached to return a Deferred,
	which gives BotPerspective.attached a chance to disconnect the old
	slave first.
	(BuildMaster.loadConfig): add code (disabled) to validate that all
	builders use known slaves (listed in c['bots']). The check won't
	work with tuple-specified builders, which are deprecated but not
	yet invalid, so the check is disabled for now.
	(BuildMaster.loadConfig_Slaves): move slave-config into a separate
	routine, do the add/changed/removed dance with them like we do
	with builders.
	(BuildMaster.loadConfig_Sources): move source-config into a
	separate routine too

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (Status.getSlave): get the
	SlaveStatus object from the BotPerspective, not the BotMaster.

	* buildbot/test/test_run.py: bunch of new tests for losing the
	buildslave at various points in the build, handling a slave that
	connects multiple times, and making sure we can interrupt a
	running build

	* buildbot/slave/bot.py (BuildSlave): make it possible to use
	something other than 'Bot' for the Bot object, to make certain
	test cases easier to write.
	(BuildSlave.waitUntilDisconnected): utility method for testing

2004-11-30  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_run.py (RunMixin): refactor, remove debug msg

	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IBuilderControl.ping): add timeout=
	argument, return a Deferred that always fires with True or False.
	I don't use an errback to indicate 'ping failed' so that callers
	are free to ignore the deferred without causing spurious errors in
	the logs.
	* buildbot/process/builder.py (BuilderControl.ping): implement it

	* buildbot/test/test_run.py (Status.testDisappear): test ping
	(Status.disappearSlave): fix it

2004-11-30  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IBuildControl): add .stopBuild
	(IBuilderControl): add .getBuild(num), only works for the current
	build, of course, although it might be interesting to offer
	something for builds in the .waiting or .interlocked state.

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build): have .stopBuild just do the
	interrupt, then let the build die by itself.
	(BuildControl): add .stopBuild, and add a point-event named
	'interrupt' just after the build so status viewers can tell that
	someone killed it.
	(BuilderControl): add .getBuild

	* buildbot/process/step.py (Dummy): use haltOnFailure so it really
	stops when you kill it, good for testing
	(ShellCommand.interrupt): add a logfile named 'interrupt' which
	contains the 'reason' text.

	* buildbot/status/html.py: Add Stop Build button, if the build can
	still be stopped. Send a Redirect (to the top page) one second
	later, hopefully long enough for the interrupt to have an effect.
	Move make_row() up to top-level to share it between Stop Build and
	Force Build.

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py: only kill the child process once

	* buildbot/test/test_run.py: add testInterrupt

2004-11-29  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/base.py: Refactor command interruption. The
	Build is now responsible for noticing that the slave has gone
	away: Build.lostRemote() interrupts the current step and makes
	sure that no further ones will be started.
	
	* buildbot/process/builder.py: When the initial remote_startBuild
	message fails, log it: this usually indicates that the slave has
	gone away, but we don't really start paying attention until they
	fail to respond to the first step's command.

	* buildbot/process/step.py (RemoteCommand): Does *not* watch for
	slave disconnect. Now sports a new interrupt() method. Error
	handling was simplified a lot by chaining deferreds, so
	remoteFailed/remoteComplete were merged into a single
	remoteComplete method (which can now get a Failure object).
	Likewise failed/finished were merged into just _finished.
	(BuildStep): Add interrupt(why) method, and if why is a
	ConnectionLost Failure then the step is failed with some useful
	error text.

	* buildbot/slave/bot.py: stop the current command when the remote
	Step reference is lost, and when the slave is shut down.
	(Bot): make it a MultiService, so it can have children. Use
	stopService to tell when the slave is shutting down.
	(SlaveBuilder): make it a Service, and a child of the Bot. Add
	remote_interruptCommand (which asks the current SlaveCommand to
	stop but allows it to keep emitting status messages), and
	stopCommand (which tells it to shut up and die).

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py: make commands interruptible
	(ShellCommand.kill): factor out os.kill logic
	(Command): factor out setup()
	(Command.sendStatus): don't send status if .running is false, this
	happens when the command has been halted.
	(Command.interrupt): new method, used to tell the command to die
	(SlaveShellCommand): implement .interrupt
	(DummyCommand): implement .interrupt
	(SourceBase, etc): factor out setup(), don't continue substeps if
	.interrupted is set

	* buildbot/status/builder.py: fix all waitUntilFinished() methods
	so they can be called after finishing

	* buildbot/test/test_run.py: new tests for disconnect behavior,
	refactor slave-shutdown routines, add different kinds of
	slave-shutdown

2004-11-27  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcStatusBot.convertTime): utility
	method to express ETA time like "2m45s" instead of "165 seconds"

2004-11-24  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (VC.testArch): unregister the test
	archive after the test completes, to avoid cluttering the user's
	'tla archives' listing with a bogus entry. Arch doesn't happen to
	provide any way to override the use of ~/.arch-params/, so there
	isn't a convenient way to avoid touching the setup of the user who
	runs the test.
	(VC_HTTP.testArchHTTP): same

2004-11-23  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/html.py (TextLog): split render() up into
	render_HEAD and render_GET. Use a Producer when sending log
	chunks, to reduce memory requirements and avoid sending huge
	non-Banana-able strings over web.distrib connections. Requires
	peeking under the covers of IStatusLog.
	(TextLog.resumeProducing): fix the "as text" link, handle client
	disconnects that occur while we're still sending old chunks.

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (HTMLLogFile.waitUntilFinished): oops,
	use defer.succeed, not the non-existent defer.success
	(LogFile.waitUntilFinished): same
	(LogFile.subscribe): don't add watchers to a finished logfile

	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): bump to 0.6.1+ while between
	releases

2004-11-23  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): Releasing buildbot-0.6.1

2004-11-23  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* NEWS: update for the 0.6.1 release
	* MANIFEST.in: add new files

	* README (INSTALLATION): explain how to enable the extra VC tests

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (LogFile): add .runEntries at the class
	level to, so old pickled builds can be displayed ok

2004-11-22  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* NEWS: summarize updates since last release

	* README (SLAVE): fix usage of 'buildbot slave' command. Thanks to
	Yoz Grahame. Closes SF#1050138.

	* docs/changes.xhtml (FreshCVSSourceNewcred): fix typo. Closes
	SF#1042563.

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (Trial): update docs a bit

	* docs/factories.xhtml: fix Trial factory docs to match reality.
	Closes: SF#1049758.

	* buildbot/process/factory.py (Trial.__init__): add args for
	randomly= and recurse=, making them available to instantiators
	instead of only to subclassers. Closes: SF#1049759.

2004-11-15  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py (QuickTwistedBuildFactory):
	try to teach the Quick factory to use multiple versions of python

2004-11-12  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuilderStatus.saveYourself): use a
	safer w32-compatible approach, and only use it on windows
	(BuildStatus.saveYourself): same

2004-11-11  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (LogFile.addEntry): smarter way to do
	it: one string merge per chunk. There are now separate .entries
	and .runEntries lists: when enumerating over all chunks, make sure
	to look at both.
	* buildbot/test/test_status.py (Log): more tests

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (LogFile.addEntry): Merge string
	chunks together, up to 10kb per chunk. This ought to cut down on
	the CPU-burning overhead of large log files. Thanks to Alexander
	Staubo for spotting the problem.
	* buildbot/test/test_status.py (Log): tests for same

2004-11-10  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/mail.py (MailNotifier.buildMessage): add a Date
	header to outbound mail
	* buildbot/test/test_status.py (Mail.testBuild1): test for same

2004-11-08  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuilderStatus.saveYourself): w32
	can't do os.rename() onto an existing file, so catch the exception
	and unlink the target file first. This introduces a slight window
	where the existing file could be lost, but the main failure case
	(disk full) should still be handled safely.
	(BuildStatus.saveYourself): same

	* buildbot/changes/pb.py (ChangePerspective): use a configurable
	separator character instead of os.sep, because the filenames being
	split here are coming from the VC system, which can have a
	different pathname convention than the local host. This should
	help a buildmaster running on windows that uses a CVS repository
	which runs under unix.
	* buildbot/changes/mail.py (MaildirSource): same, for all parsers

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (Trial.createSummary): survive
	when there are no test failures to be parsed

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (createMaster): use shutil.copy()
	instead of the unix-specific os.system("cp"), thanks to Elliot
	Murphy for this and the other buildbot-vs-windows catches.
	* buildbot/test/test_maildir.py (MaildirTest.deliverMail): same

	* contrib/windows/buildbot.bat: prefix a '@', apparently to not
	echo the command as it is run

	* setup.py: install sample.mk too, not just sample.cfg
	(scripts): install contrib/windows/buildbot.bat on windows

2004-11-07  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/builder.py (Builder._detached): clear the
	self.currentBuild reference, otherwise the next build will be
	skipped because we think the Builder is already in use.

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: update to match current usage
	on the Twisted buildbot

2004-10-29  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/mail.py (MailNotifier): fix typo in docs

2004-10-28  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (SourceBase): refactor subclasses to
	have separate doVCUpdate/doVCFull methods. Catch an update failure
	and respond by clobbering the source directory and re-trying. This
	will handle local changes (like replacing a file with a directory)
	that will cause CVS and SVN updates to fail.
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (SetupMixin.do_vc): test the same

	* buildbot/process/step.py (LoggedRemoteCommand.__repr__): avoid a
	python-2.4 warning

2004-10-19  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (Trial.createSummary): bugfixes

	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceTestResults): display any
	TestResults that the Build might have
	(StatusResourceTestResult): and the logs for each TestResult
	(StatusResourceBuild): add link from the per-build page

2004-10-15  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (Trial.createSummary): parse
	the 'problems' portion of stdout, add TestResults to our build
	* buildbot/test/test_twisted.py (Parse.testParse): test it

	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IBuildStatus.getTestResults): new method
	to retrieve a dict of accumulated test results
	(ITestResult): define what a single test result can do
	* buildbot/status/builder.py (TestResult): implement ITestResult
	(BuildStatus.getTestResults): retrieve dict of TestResults
	(BuildStatus.addTestResult): add TestResults
	* buildbot/test/test_status.py (Results.testAddResults): test it

2004-10-14  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_maildir.py (MaildirTest): use shutil.rmtree
	instead of os.system("rm -rf") for win32 portability

	* buildbot/test/test_slavecommand.py (SlaveCommandTestCase): use
	SignalMixin instead of starting/stopping the reactor, which is
	likely to cause problems with other tests

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (SourceBase.doCopy): remove leftover
	self.copyComplete() call. Yoz Grahame makes the catch.

	* contrib/windows/buildbot.bat: helper script to deal with path
	issues. Thanks to Yoz Grahame.

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.startService): don't register a
	SIGHUP handler if the signal module has no SIGHUP attribute.
	Apparently win32 does this.

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (start): add --reactor=win32 on win32

	* buildbot/test/test_web.py (WebTest.test_webPathname): skip the
	test if the reactor can't offer UNIX sockets

	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceBuild.body): fix syntax
	error introduced in the last commit. We really need that
	metabuildbot :).

2004-10-12  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/changes/mail.py (MaildirSource.describe): fix exception
	when describing a maildir source. Thanks to Stephen Davis.

	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcStatusBot.command_WATCH): round off
	ETA seconds

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (createMaster): install Makefile too
	(start): add --no_save to 'start' command
	* buildbot/scripts/sample.mk: simple convenience Makefile with 
	start/stop/reload targets

	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): bump to 0.6.0+ while between
	releases

2004-09-30  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* setup.py: Releasing buildbot-0.6.0

2004-09-30  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	test_trial.py from the source tarball until support is complete.

	* NEWS: update for 0.6.0 release
	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): same
	* README: same

	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcStatusBot.command_SOURCE): add
	'source' command to tell users where to get the Buildbot source

	* docs/examples/*.cfg: update to modern standards

	* NEWS: update for release

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py (createMaster): remove the
	-shutdown.tap stuff now that it isn't necessary
	(createSlave): same
	(start): launch buildbot.tap, not buildbot-shutdown.tap


	* buildbot/status/mail.py (Domain): shorten class name
	(MailNotifier): if lookup= is a string, pass it to Domain()
	* buildbot/test/test_status.py (Mail.testBuild1): new class name
	(Mail.testBuild2): test the string-to-Domain shortcut
	(Mail.testMail): fix test


	* buildbot/scripts/sample.cfg: improve the build-the-buildbot
	example config file

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuildStatus.__setstate__): re-set
	more attributes on load
	(BuilderStatus.stubBuildCacheSize): bump to 30, this was too low
	to accomodate the whole waterfall page at once, and the thrashing
	results in a lot of unnecessary loads
	(BuildStatus.saveYourself): use binary pickles, not fluffy text
	(BuilderStatus.saveYourself): same
	(BuilderStatus.eventGenerator): stop generating on the first missing
	build. We assume that saved builds are deleted oldest-first.
	(BuildStepStatus.__getstate__): .progress might not exist

	* buildbot/changes/changes.py (ChangeMaster): make it
	serializable, in $masterdir/changes.pck
	(ChangeMaster.stopService): save on shutdown
	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadChanges): load at startup
	* buildbot/test/test_config.py: load Changes before config file


	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (ShellCommand.doTimeout): put the
	"Oh my god, you killed the command" header on a separate line

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuilderStatus.getStubBuildByNumber):
	skip over corrupted build pickles
	(BuilderStatus.getFullBuildByNumber): same
	(BuilderStatus.eventGenerator): skip over unavailable builds
	(BuildStatus.saveYourself): save builds to a .tmp file first, then
	do an atomic rename. This prevents a corrupted pickle when some
	internal serialization error occurs.
	(BuilderStatus.saveYourself): same

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (SlaveShellCommand): oops, restore
	the timeout for shell commands, it got lost somehow

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuilderStatus.eventGenerator): if we
	run out of build steps, return the rest of the builder events

	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IBuilderControl.ping): add method

	* buildbot/process/builder.py (BuilderControl.ping): move
	slave-ping to BuilderControl, and fix the failure case in the
	process (Event.finish() is the verb, Event.finished is the noun).

	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceBuilder.ping): ping
	through the BuilderControl instead of the BuilderStatus
	(EventBox): add adapter for builder.Event, allowing builder events to
	be displayed in the waterfall display

	* buildbot/master.py (BotMaster.stopService): add a 'master
	shutdown' event to the builder's log
	(BuildMaster.startService): and a 'master started' on startup

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuilderStatus.eventGenerator): merge
	builder events into the BuildStep event stream
	(Status.builderAdded): add a 'builder created' event


	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcStatusBot.command_WATCH): new
	command to announce the completion of a running build
	(IrcStatusBot.command_FORCE): announce when the build finishes

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuilderStatus.addFullBuildToCache):
	don't evict unfinished builds from the cache: they must stay in
	the full-cache until their logfiles have stopped changing. Make
	sure the eviction loop terminates if an unfinished build was hit.
	(HTMLLogFile.getTextWithHeaders): return HTML as if it were text.
	This lets exceptions be dumped in an email status message. Really
	we need LogFiles which contain both text and HTML, instead of two
	separate classes.
	(BuildStatus.__getstate__): handle self.finished=False
	(Status.builderAdded): if the pickle is corrupted, abandon the
	history and create a new BuilderStatus object.

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.stopBuild): tolerate lack of a
	self.progress attribute, helped one test which doesn't fully set
	up the Build object.

	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IStatusLogStub): split out some of the
	IStatusLog methods into an Interface that is implemented by "stub"
	logs, for which all the actual text chunks are on disk (in the
	pickled Build instance). To show the log contents, you must first
	adapt the stub log to a full IStatusLog object.

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (LogFileStub): create separate stub
	log objects, which can be upgraded to a real one if necessary.
	(LogFile): make them persistable, and let them stubify themselves
	(HTMLLogFile): same
	(BuildStepStatus): same
	(BuildStatus): same
	(BuildStatus.saveYourself): save the whole build out to disk
	(BuilderStatus): make it persistable
	(BuilderStatus.saveYourself): save the builder to disk
	(BuilderStatus.addFullBuildToCache): implement two caches which
	hold Build objects: a small one which holds full Builds, and a
	larger one which holds "stubbed" Builds (ones with their LogFiles
	turned into LogFileStubs). This reduces memory usage by the
	buildmaster by not keeping more than a few (default is 2) whole
	build logs in RAM all the time.
	(BuilderStatus.getBuild): rewrite to pull from disk (through the
	cache)
	(BuilderStatus.eventGenerator): rewrite since .builds went away
	(BuilderStatus.buildStarted): remove the .builds array. Add the
	build to the "full" cache when it starts.
	(BuilderStatus._buildFinished): save the build to disk when it
	finishes
	(Status): give it a basedir (same as the BuildMaster's basedir)
	where the builder pickles can be saved
	(Status.builderAdded): create the BuilderStatus ourselves, by
	loading a pickle from disk (or creating a new instance if there
	was none on disk). Return the BuilderStatus so the master can glue
	it into the new Builder object.

	* buildbot/master.py (BotMaster.stopService): on shutdown, tell
	all BuilderStatuses to save themselves out to disk. This is in
	lieu of saving anything important in the main Application pickle
	 (the -shutdown.tap file).
	(BuildMaster.__init__): give Status() a basedir for its files
	(BuildMaster.loadConfig_Builders): do status.builderAdded first,
	to get the BuilderStatus, then give it to the Builder (instead of
	doing it the other way around). It's ok if the status announces
	the new Builder before it's really ready, as the outside world can
	only see the BuilderStatus object anyway (and it is ready before
	builderAdded returns). Use the builder's "builddir" (which
	normally specifies where the slave will run the builder) as the
	master's basedir (for saving serialized builds).

	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceBuildStep.getChild):
	coerce the logfile to IStatusLog before trying to get the text
	chunks out of it. This will pull the full (non-stubified) Build in
	from disk if necessary.
	(TextLog): fix the adapter registration

	* buildbot/test/test_control.py (Force.setUp): create the basedir
	* buildbot/test/test_web.py: same
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (SetupMixin.setUp): same
	* buildbot/test/test_status.py (Mail.makeBuild): match new setup
	* buildbot/test/test_run.py (Run.testMaster): same
	(Status.setUp): same

2004-09-29  Fred L. Drake, Jr.  <fdrake@acm.org>

	* buildbot/status/html.py (Waterfall.__init__): store actual
	allowForce flag passed in rather than using True for everyone;
	make sure setting it to False doesn't cause a NameError
	(Waterfall.setup).
	(StatusResourceBuilder.__init__) add the builder name to the page
	title.
	(StatusResourceBuilder.body) move HTML generation for a name/value
	row into a helper method (StatusResourceBuilder.make_row); only
	generate the "Force Build" form if allowForce was True and the
	slave is connected.  Use class attributes in the generated HTML to
	spread a little CSS-joy.

2004-09-28  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (Trial.createSummary): fix
	warning-scanner to not ignore things like
	'ComponentsDeprecationWarning' and 'exceptions.RuntimeWarning'
 
	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResource.control): add some
	class-level values for .control in an attempt to make upgrading
	smoother

	* buildbot/util.py (ComparableMixin): survive missing attributes,
	such as when a class is modified and we're comparing old instances
	against new ones

	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcStatusBot.privmsg): clean up
	failure handling, remove a redundant try/except block. Don't
	return the full traceback to the IRC channel.
	(IrcStatusBot.command_FORCE): catch new exceptions, return useful
	error messages. Get ETA properly.

	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceBuild.body): html.escape
	the reason, since (at least) IRC message will have <> in them.
	(StatusResourceBuilder.__init__): take an IBuilderControl
	(StatusResourceBuilder.force): use the IBuilderControl we get in
	the constructor instead of trying to make our own. Catch the
	new exceptions and ignore them for now (until we make an
	intermediate web page where we could show the error message)
	(StatusResource): create with an IControl, use it to give an
	IBuilderControl to all children
	(Waterfall): take an allowForce= option, pass an IControl object
	to StatusResource if it is True

	* buildbot/test/test_web.py (ConfiguredMaster): handle IControl

	* buildbot/master.py (BotPerspective.perspective_forceBuild):
	catch new exceptions and return string forms

	* buildbot/interfaces.py: add NoSlaveError, BuilderInUseError
	* buildbot/process/builder.py (Builder.forceBuild): raise them
	* buildbot/test/test_control.py (Force.testNoSlave): new test
	(Force.testBuilderInUse): same


	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcStatusBot): enable build-forcing

	* buildbot/test/test_run.py: use IControl
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py: same

	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceBuilder.force): rewrite
	to use IControl. Still offline.
	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcStatusBot.command_FORCE): same

	* buildbot/process/builder.py (Builder.doPeriodicBuild): set
	who=None so periodic builds don't send out status mail
	(Builder.forceBuild): include reason in the log message
	(BuilderControl.forceBuild): rename 'name' to 'who'

	* buildbot/master.py (BotPerspective.perspective_forceBuild): add
	'who' parameter, but make it None by default so builds forced by
	slave admins don't cause status mail to be sent to anybody
	(BotMaster.forceBuild): same. this method is deprecated.
	(DebugPerspective.perspective_forceBuild): same, use IControl.
	(DebugPerspective.perspective_fakeChange): use IControl..
	(Dispatcher.requestAvatar): .. so don't set .changemaster

	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IBuilderControl.forceBuild): rename 'who'
	parameter to avoid confusion with the name of the builder


	* buildbot/status/mail.py: refine comment about needing 2.3

	* buildbot/status/html.py: move all imports to the top

	* buildbot/test/test_control.py: test new interfaces
	* buildbot/test/test_run.py (Status): handle new interfaces
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (SetupMixin.doBuild): same

	* buildbot/process/base.py (BuildControl): implement IBuildControl
	and its lonely getStatus() method

	* buildbot/process/builder.py (BuilderControl): implement
	IBuilderControl, obtained by adapting the Builder instance
	(Builder.startBuild): return a BuilderControl instead of a
	Deferred. The caller can use bc.getStatus().waitUntilFinished() to
	accomplish the same thing.

	* buildbot/master.py: move all import statements to the top
	(Control): implement IControl, obtained by adapting the
	BuildMaster instance.

	* buildbot/interfaces.py: add IControl, IBuilderControl, and
	IBuildControl. These are used to force builds. Eventually they
	will provide ways to reconfigure the Builders, pause or abandon a
	Build, and perhaps control the BuildMaster itself.

2004-09-26  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/util.py (ComparableMixin): survive twisted>1.3.0 which
	ends up comparing us against something without a .__class__

2004-09-24  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py: rearrange option parsing a lot, to get
	usage text right.

	* Makefile: add 'deb-snapshot' target, to create a timestamped
	.deb package

	* debian/rules (binary-indep): skip CVS/ files in dh_installexamples

2004-09-23  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/__init__.py (version): move version string here
	* setup.py: get version string from buildbot.version
	* buildbot/status/html.py (WaterfallStatusResource.body): add
	buildbot version to the page footer
	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcStatusBot.command_VERSION): provide
	version when asked

	* buildbot/master.py (BotMaster.getPerspective): detect duplicate
	slaves, let the second know where the first one is coming from
	(BuildMaster.__init__): turn on .unsafeTracebacks so the slave can
	see our exceptions. It would be nice if there were a way to just
	send them the exception type and value, not the full traceback.


	* buildbot/status/mail.py (MailNotifier): add a new argument
	sendToInterestedUsers=, which can be set to False to disable the
	usual send-to-blamelist behavior.
	(top): handle python-2.2 which has no email.MIMEMultipart
	(MailNotifier.buildMessage): don't send logs without MIMEMultipart
	(MailNotifier.disownServiceParent): unsubscribe on removal

	* buildbot/test/test_status.py (Mail.testBuild2): test it


	* buildbot/status/progress.py (Expectations.wavg): tolerate
	current=None, which happens when steps start failing badly
	* buildbot/test/test_status.py (Progress.testWavg): test for it

	* buildbot/process/step.py (SVN.startVC): when the (old) slave
	doesn't understand args['revision'], emit a warning instead of
	bailing completely. Updating to -rHEAD is probably close enough.

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (Trial.start): fix sanity-check

	* buildbot/test/test_status.py: at least import bb.status.client
	even if we don't have any test coverage for it yet

	* contrib/svn_buildbot.py: don't require python2.3
	(main): wait, do require it (for sets.py), but explain how to
	make it work under python2.2

2004-09-23  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* contrib/svn_buildbot.py: include the revision number in the Change

	* buildbot/changes/freshcvs.py (FreshCVSSourceNewcred): use when=,
	using util.now() because FreshCVS is a realtime service

	* buildbot/status/event.py: delete dead code
	* buildbot/process/step.py: don't import dead Event class
	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py: same
	* buildbot/status/builder.py: same
	* buildbot/status/client.py: same

	* buildbot/test/test_process.py: kill buggy out-of-date disabled test

	* buildbot/changes/changes.py (Change): set .when from an __init__
	argument (which defaults to now()), rather than having
	ChangeMaster.addChange set it later.
	(ChangeMaster.addChange): same

	* buildbot/changes/mail.py (parseFreshCVSMail): pass in when=
	(parseSyncmail): same. Just use util.now() for now.
	(parseBonsaiMail): parse the timestamp field for when=

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (SourceStamp.addChange): page in when=
	instead of setting .when after the fact

2004-09-22  slyphon

	* buildbot/slave/trial.py: new SlaveCommand to machine-parse test
	results when the target project uses retrial. Still under
	development.
	* buildbot/test/test_trial.py: same

2004-09-21  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/mail.py (MailNotifier.__init__): include
	success/warnings/failure in the Subject line
	(MailNotifier.buildMessage): add the buildbot's URL to the body,
	use step.logname for the addLogs=True attachment filenames
	* buildbot/test/test_status.py (Mail): test Subject lines
	(Mail.testLogs): test attachment filenames

	* buildbot/master.py (DebugPerspective.perspective_fakeChange):
	accept a 'who' argument from the debug tool
	* contrib/debugclient.py (DebugWidget.do_commit): send 'who'
	* contrib/debug.glade: add text box to set 'who'

	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IBuildStatus.getBuilder): replace
	.getBuilderName with .getBuilder().getName(), more flexible
	(IStatusLog.getName): logs have short names, but you can prefix
	them with log.getStep().getName() to make them more useful
	* buildbot/status/builder.py: same
	* buildbot/status/client.py: same
	* buildbot/status/html.py: same
	* buildbot/test/test_run.py (Status.testSlave): same
	* buildbot/process/step.py: tweak logfile names

	* buildbot/status/mail.py (MailNotifier): add lookup, change
	argument to extraRecipients. The notifier is now aimed at sending
	mail to the people involved in a particular build, with additional
	constant recipients as a secondary function.

	* buildbot/test/test_status.py: add coverage for IEmailLookup,
	including slow-lookup and failing-lookup. Make sure the blamelist
	members are included.

	* buildbot/interfaces.py: new interfaces IEmailSender+IEmailLookup
	(IBuildStatus.getResponsibleUsers): rename from getBlamelist
	(IBuildStatus.getInterestedUsers): new method
	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuildStatus.getResponsibleUsers): same
	* buildbot/status/client.py (remote_getResponsibleUsers): same
	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceBuild.body): same
	* buildbot/test/test_run.py (Status.testSlave): same

2004-09-20  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/users.xhtml: update concepts

	* Makefile: add a convenience makefile, for things like 'make
	test'. It is not included in the source tarball.

2004-09-16  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* NEWS: mention /usr/bin/buildbot, debian/*

	* debian/*: add preliminary debian packaging. Many thanks to
	Kirill Lapshin (and Kevin Turner) for the hard work. I've mangled
	it considerably since it left their hands, I am responsible for
	all breakage that's resulted.

	* bin/buildbot: create a top-level 'buildbot' command, to be
	installed in /usr/bin/buildbot . For now it's just a simple
	frontend to mktap/twistd/kill, but eventually it will be the entry
	point to the 'try' command and also a status client. It is also
	intended to support the upcoming debian-packaging init.d scripts.
	* buildbot/scripts/runner.py: the real work is done here
	* buildbot/scripts/__init__.py: need this too
	* buildbot/scripts/sample.cfg: this is installed in new
	buildmaster directories
	* setup.py: install new stuff

2004-09-15  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py: skip SVN tests if svn can't handle the
	'file:' schema (the version shipped with OS-X was built without the
	ra_local plugin).
	(SetupMixin.tearDown): stop the goofy twisted.web timer which
	updates the log-timestamp, to make sure it isn't still running after
	the test finishes

	* docs/config.xhtml: Add projectName, projectURL, buildbotURL
	values to the config file.
	* docs/examples/hello.cfg: add examples
	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IStatus.getBuildbotURL): define accessors
	* buildbot/status/builder.py (Status.getProjectURL): implement them
	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadConfig): set them from config
	* buildbot/test/test_config.py (ConfigTest.testSimple): test them
	* buildbot/status/html.py (WaterfallStatusResource): display them


	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (FakeBuilder.name): add attribute so
	certain error cases don't suffer a secondary exception.
	(top): Skip tests if the corresponding VC tool is not installed.

	* buildbot/process/factory.py (Trial): introduce separate
	'buildpython' and 'trialpython' lists, since trialpython=[] is
	what you want to invoke /usr/bin/python, whereas ./setup.py is
	less likely to be executable. Add env= parameter to pass options
	to test cases (which is how I usually write tests, I don't know if
	anyone else does it this way).

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (Trial): handle python=None.
	Require 'testpath' be a string, not a list. Fix tests= typo.
	(Trial.start): sanity-check any PYTHONPATH value for stringness.

	* buildbot/process/step.py (RemoteCommand._remoteFailed): goofy
	way to deal with the possibility of removing the disconnect notify
	twice.
	(CVS): add a 'login' parameter to give a password to 'cvs login',
	commonly used with pserver methods (where pw="" or pw="guest")

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (SourceBase): move common args
	extraction and setup() to __init__, so everything is ready by the
	time setup() is called
	(CVS.start): call 'cvs login' if a password was supplied
	(ShellCommand): special-case PYTHONPATH: prepend the master's
	value to any existing slave-local value.

	* buildbot/process/builder.py (Builder.updateBigStatus): if we
	don't have a remote, mark the builder as Offline. This whole
	function should probably go away and be replaced by individual
	deltas.
	(Builder.buildFinished): return the results to the build-finished
	deferred callback, helps with testing

2004-09-14  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py: put all the repositories needed to run
	the complete tests into a single small (1.3MB) tarball, so I can
	make that tarball available on the buildbot web site. Test HTTP
	access (for Arch and Darcs) by spawning a temporary web server
	while the test runs.

	* docs/users.xhtml: new document, describe Buildbot's limited
	understanding of different human users

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py: rearrange test cases a bit

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (Trial): handle testpath=
	* buildbot/process/factory.py (Trial): update to use step.Trial

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (ShellCommandPP): fix fatal typo

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuildStatus.getText): add text2 to
	the overall build text (which gives you 'failed 2 tests' rather
	than just 'failed')
	(BuildStepStatus.text2): default to [], not None

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (Trial.commandComplete): text2
	must be a list

2004-09-12  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/master.py (BotPerspective._commandsUnavailable): don't
	log the whole exception if it's just an AttributeError (old slave)

	* buildbot/process/step.py (ShellCommand.__init__): stash .workdir
	so (e.g.) sub-commands can be run in the right directory.
	(ShellCommand.start): accept an optional errorMessage= argument
	to make life easier for SVN.start
	(SVN.startVC): put the "can't do mode=export" warning in the LogFile
	headers
	(ShellCommand.start): move ['dir'] compatibility hack..
	(RemoteShellCommand.start): .. to here so everyone can use it

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (Trial): use .workdir

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (BuildDebs.getText): fix the
	text displayed when debuild fails completely
	(Trial): snarf _trial_temp/test.log from the slave and display it

2004-09-11  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (ProcessDocs.getText): typo

	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py (TwistedTrial.tests): oops,
	set to 'twisted', so --recurse can find twisted/web/test/*, etc

	* buildbot/process/step.py (ShellCommand): call .createSummary
	before .evaluateCommand instead of the other way around. This
	makes it slightly easier to count warnings and then use that to
	set results=WARNINGS
	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py: cosmetic, swap the methods

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.buildFinished): update status
	before doing progress. It's embarrassing for the build to be stuck
	in the "building" state when an exceptions occurs elsewhere..

	* buildbot/status/progress.py (Expectations.expectedBuildTime):
	python2.2 doesn't have 'sum'

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (Status.getBuilderNames): return a copy,
	to prevent clients from accidentally sorting it

	* buildbot/master.py (Manhole): add username/password
	(BuildMaster.loadConfig): use c['manhole']=Manhole() rather than
	c['manholePort'], deprecate old usage
	* docs/config.xhtml: document c['manhole']
	* docs/examples/hello.cfg: show example of using a Manhole


	* buildbot/test/test_steps.py (FakeBuilder.getSlaveCommandVersion):
	pretend the slave is up to date

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuildStepStatus.stepFinished): 'log',
	the module, overlaps with 'log', the local variable

	* buildbot/status/html.py: oops, 2.2 needs __future__ for generators

	* buildbot/process/builder.py (Builder.getSlaveCommandVersion):
	new method to let Steps find out the version of their
	corresponding SlaveCommand.
	* buildbot/process/step.py (BuildStep.slaveVersion): utility method
	(ShellCommand.start): add 'dir' argument for <=0.5.0 slaves
	(CVS.startVC): backwards compatibility for <=0.5.0 slaves
	(SVN.startVC): same
	(Darcs.startVC): detect old slaves (missing the 'darcs' command)
	(Arch.startVC): same
	(P4Sync.startVC): same

	* buildbot/process/step.py (LoggedRemoteCommand.start): return the
	Deferred so we can catch errors in remote_startCommand
	(RemoteShellCommand.start): same

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: update sample config file

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (ShellCommandPP): write to stdin
	after connectionMade() is called, not before. Close stdin at that
	point too.

	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py: update to use Trial, clean
	up argument passing (move to argv arrays instead of string
	commands)

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (Trial): new step to replace
	RunUnitTests, usable by any trial-using project (not just
	Twisted). Arguments have changed, see the docstring for details.

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.startBuild): this now returns a
	Deferred. Exceptions that occur during setupBuild are now
	caught better and lead to fewer build_status weirdnesses, like
	finishing a build that was never started.
	(Build.buildFinished): fire the Deferred instead of calling
	builder.buildFinished directly. The callback argument is this
	Build, everything else can be extracted from it, including the
	new build.results attribute.
	* buildbot/process/builder.py (Builder.startBuild): same
	(Builder.buildFinished): same, extract results from build

	* buildbot/process/step.py (ShellCommands): remove dead code

2004-09-08  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (VC.doPatch): verify that a new build
	doesn't try to use the leftover patched workdir
	(SourceStamp): test source-stamp computation for CVS and SVN

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (SourceBase.doPatch): mark the
	patched workdir ('touch .buildbot-patched') so we don't try to
	update it later
	(SourceBase.start): add ['revision'] for all Source steps
	(CVS): change args: use ['branch'] for -r, remove ['files']
	(CVS.buildVC): fix revision/branch stuff
	(SVN): add revision stuff

	* buildbot/process/step.py (BuildStep.__init__): reject unknown
	kwargs (except 'workdir') to avoid silent spelling errors
	(ShellCommand.__init__): same
	(Source): new base class for CVS/SVN/etc. Factor out everything
	common, add revision computation (perform the checkout with a -D
	DATE or -r REVISION that gets exactly the sources described by the
	last Change), overridable with step.alwaysUseLatest. Add patch
	handling (build.getSourceStamp can trigger the use of a base
	revision and a patch).
	(CVS, SVN, Darcs, Arch, P4Sync): refactor, remove leftover arguments
	* docs/steps.xhtml: update docs
	* docs/source.xhtml: mention .checkoutDelay
	* docs/examples/hello.cfg: show use of checkoutDelay, alwaysUseLatest

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.setSourceStamp): add a
	.sourceStamp attribute to each Build. If set, this indicates that
	the build should be done with something other than the most
	recent source tree. This will be used to implement "try" builds.
	(Build.allChanges): new support method
	(Build.lastChangeTime): remove, functionality moved to Source steps
	(Build.setupBuild): copy the Step args before adding ['workdir'],
	to avoid modifying the BuildFactory (and thus triggering spurious
	config changes)


	* buildbot/status/html.py: rename s/commits/changes/
	(StatusResourceChanges): same
	(CommitBox.getBox): same, update URL
	(WaterfallStatusResource): same
	(StatusResource.getChild): same

	* contrib/debugclient.py (DebugWidget.do_commit): send .revision
	* contrib/debug.glade: add optional 'revision' to the fakeChange

	* buildbot/changes/changes.py (html_tmpl): display .revision
	(ChangeMaster.addChange): note .revision in log
	* buildbot/changes/pb.py (ChangePerspective.perspective_addChange):
	accept a ['revision'] attribute

	* buildbot/process/factory.py (BuildFactory): use ComparableMixin

	* buildbot/master.py (BotMaster.getPerspective): update the
	.connected flag in SlaveStatus when it connects
	(BotMaster.detach): and when it disconnects
	(DebugPerspective.perspective_fakeChange): take a 'revision' attr
	(BuildMaster.loadConfig_Builders): walk old list correctly

	* buildbot/test/test_config.py: fix prefix= usage

2004-09-06  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* NEWS: mention P4

	* buildbot/changes/p4poller.py (P4Source): New ChangeSource to
	poll a P4 depot looking for recent changes. Thanks to Dave
	Peticolas for the contribution. Probably needs some testing after
	I mangled it.

	* buildbot/process/step.py (P4Sync): simple P4 source-updater,
	requires manual client setup for each buildslave. Rather
	experimental. Thanks again to Dave Peticolas.
	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (P4Sync): slave-side source-updater

	* buildbot/changes/changes.py (Change): add a .revision attribute,
	which will eventually be used to generate source-stamp values.

	* buildbot/process/step.py (RemoteCommand.start): use
	notifyOnDisconnect to notice when we lose the slave, then treat it
	like an exception. This allows LogFiles to be closed and the build
	to be wrapped up normally. Be sure to remove the disconnect
	notification when the step completes so we don't accumulate a
	bazillion such notifications which will fire weeks later (when the
	slave finally disconnects normally). Fixes SF#915807, thanks to
	spiv (Andrew Bennetts) for the report.
	(LoggedRemoteCommand): move __init__ code to RemoteCommand, since it
	really isn't Logged- specific
	(LoggedRemoteCommand.remoteFailed): Add an extra newline to the
	header, since it's almost always going to be appended to an
	incomplete line
	* buildbot/test/test_steps.py (BuildStep.testShellCommand1):
	update test to handle use of notifyOnDisconnect

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuilderStatus.currentlyOffline):
	don't clear .ETA and .currentBuild when going offline, let the
	current build clean up after itself

	* buildbot/process/builder.py (Builder.detached): wait a moment
	before doing things like stopping the current build, because the
	current step will probably notice the disconnect and cleanup the
	build by itself
	* buildbot/test/test_run.py (Status.tearDown): update test to
	handle asynchronous build-detachment

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.stopBuild): minor shuffles

	* buildbot/status/html.py (WaterfallStatusResource.buildGrid):
	hush a debug message

2004-09-05  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/changes/maildir.py (Maildir.start): catch an IOError
	when the dnotify fcntl() fails and fall back to polling. Linux 2.2
	kernels do this: the fcntl module has the F_NOTIFY constant, but
	the kernel itself doesn't support the operation. Thanks to Olly
	Betts for spotting the problem.

	* buildbot/process/step.py (Darcs): new source-checkout command
	(Arch): new source-checkout command
	(todo_P4): fix constructor syntax, still just a placeholder
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (VC.testDarcs): test it
	(VC.testDarcsHTTP): same, via localhost HTTP
	(VC.testArch): same
	(VC.testArchHTTP): same
	* NEWS: mention new features

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (ShellCommand): add .keepStdout,
	which tells the step to stash stdout text locally (in .stdout).
	Slave-side Commands can use this to make decisions based upon the
	output of the the ShellCommand (not just the exit code).
	(Darcs): New source-checkout command
	(Arch): New source-checkout command, uses .keepStdout in one place
	where it needs to discover the archive's default name.

	* docs/steps.xhtml: Document options taken by Darcs and Arch.
	* docs/source.xhtml: add brief descriptions of Darcs and Arch
	* docs/examples/hello.cfg: add examples of Darcs and Arch checkout

	* buildbot/process/step.py (ShellCommand.describe): add an
	alternate .descriptionDone attribute which provides descriptive
	text when the step is complete. .description can be ["compiling"],
	for use while the step is running, then .descriptionDone can be
	["compile"], used alone when the step succeeds or with "failed" when
	it does not. Updated other steps to use the new text.
	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py: same
	* buildbot/test/test_run.py: update tests to match

2004-08-30  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step.py (ShellCommand.createSummary): fix docs
	(CVS.__init__): send 'patch' argument to slave
	(CVS.start): don't create the LoggedRemoteCommand until start(),
	so we can catch a .patch added after __init__
	(SVN.__init__): add 'patch' to SVN too
	(SVN.start): same

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (ShellCommand): add a 'stdin'
	argument, to let commands push data into the process' stdin pipe.
	Move usePTY to a per-instance attribute, and clear it if 'stdin'
	is in use, since closing a PTY doesn't really affect the process
	in the right way (in particular, I couldn't run /usr/bin/patch
	under a pty).
	(SourceBase.doPatch): handle 'patch' argument

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py (VC.doPatch): test 'patch' argument for
	both CVS and SVN

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (cvs_ver): fix version-parsing goo
	* buildbot/slave/bot.py (Bot.remote_getCommands): send command
	versions to master
	* buildbot/master.py (BotPerspective.got_commands): get command
	versions from slave, give to each builder
	* buildbot/process/builder.py (Builder.attached): stash slave
	command versions in .remoteCommands

	* docs/steps.xhtml: bring docs in-line with reality

	* buildbot/process/step.py (CVS.__init__): more brutal
	compatibility code removal
	(SVN.__init__): same

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (SlaveShellCommand): update docs
	(SlaveShellCommand.start): require ['workdir'] argument, remove
	the ['dir'] fallback (compatibility will come later)
	(SourceBase): update docs
	(SourceBase.start): remove ['directory'] fallback
	(CVS): update docs
	(SVN): update docs
	* buildbot/test/test_config.py (ConfigTest.testBuilders): update test
	* buildbot/test/test_steps.py (BuildStep.testShellCommand1): same
	* buildbot/test/test_slavecommand.py (SlaveCommandTestCase): same

	* buildbot/process/step.py (RemoteShellCommand.__init__): add
	want_stdout/want_stderr. remove old 'dir' keyword (to simplify the
	code.. I will figure out 0.5.0-compatibility hooks later)

2004-08-30  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py: rewrite in terms of new
	BuildFactory base class. It got significantly shorter. Yay
	negative code days.

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (HLint.start): fix to make it
	work with the new "self.build isn't nailed down until we call
	step.start()" scheme: specifically, __init__ is called before the
	build has decided on which Changes are going in, so we don't scan
	build.allFiles() for .xhtml files until start()
	(HLint.commandComplete): use getText(), not getStdout()
	(RunUnitTests.start): same: don't use .build until start()
	(RunUnitTests.describe): oops, don't report (None) when using
	the default reactor
	(RunUnitTests.commandComplete): use getText()
	(RunUnitTests.createSummary): same
	(BuildDebs.commandComplete): same

	* buildbot/process/step.py (RemoteShellCommand.__init__): don't
	set args['command'] until start(), since our BuildStep is allowed
	to change their mind up until that point
	(TreeSize.commandComplete): use getText(), not getStdout()

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: update to current standards

	* docs/factories.xhtml: update
	* buildbot/process/factory.py: implement all the common factories
	described in the docs. The Trial factory doesn't work yet, and
	I've probably broken all the process_twisted.py factories in the
	process. There are compatibility classes left in for things like
	the old BasicBuildFactory, but subclasses of them are unlikely to
	work.
	* docs/examples/glib_master.cfg: use new BuildFactories
	* docs/examples/hello.cfg: same

	* buildbot/test/test_config.py (ConfigTest.testBuilders): remove
	explicit 'workdir' args

	* buildbot/process/base.py (BuildFactory): move factories to ..
	* buildbot/process/factory.py (BuildFactory): .. here
	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py: handle move
	* buildbot/test/test_config.py: same
	* buildbot/test/test_run.py: same
	* buildbot/test/test_steps.py: same
	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py: same
	* docs/factories.xhtml: same

	* NEWS: mention config changes that require updating master.cfg

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.setupBuild): add a 'workdir'
	argument to all steps that weren't given one already, pointing at
	the "build/" directory.

	* docs/examples/hello.cfg: remove explicit 'workdir' args

	* docs/factories.xhtml: document standard BuildFactory clases,
	including a bunch which are have not yet been written

2004-08-29  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IBuildStepStatus.getResults): move
	result constants (SUCCESS, WARNINGS, FAILURE, SKIPPED) to
	buildbot.status.builder so they aren't quite so internal
	* buildbot/process/base.py, buildbot/process/builder.py: same
	* buildbot/process/maxq.py, buildbot/process/step.py: same
	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py, buildbot/status/builder.py: same
	* buildbot/status/mail.py, buildbot/test/test_run.py: same
	* buildbot/test/test_status.py, buildbot/test/test_vc.py: same

	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceBuildStep): oops, update
	to handle new getLogs()-returns-list behavior
	(StatusResourceBuildStep.getChild): same
	(StepBox.getBox): same
	(WaterfallStatusResource.phase0): same

	* docs/source.xhtml: document how Buildbot uses version-control
	systems (output side: how we get source trees)
	* docs/changes.xhtml: rename from sources.xhtml, documents VC
	systems (input side: how we learn about Changes)

	* buildbot/master.py (Manhole): use ComparableMixin
	* buildbot/changes/freshcvs.py (FreshCVSSourceNewcred): same
	* buildbot/changes/mail.py (MaildirSource): same
	* buildbot/status/client.py (PBListener): same
	* buildbot/status/html.py (Waterfall): same
	* buildbot/status/words.py (IRC): same

	* NEWS: start describing new features

	* buildbot/status/mail.py (MailNotifier): finish implementation.
	The message body is still a bit sparse.
	* buildbot/test/test_status.py (Mail): test it

	* buildbot/util.py (ComparableMixin): class to provide the __cmp__
	and __hash__ methods I wind up adding everywhere. Specifically
	intended to support the buildbot config-file update scheme where
	we compare, say, the old list of IStatusTargets against the new
	one and don't touch something which shows up on both lists.
	* buildbot/test/test_util.py (Compare): test case for it

	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IBuildStatus): change .getLogs() to
	return a list instead of a dict
	(IBuildStepStatus.getLogs): same. The idea is that steps create
	logs with vaguely unique names (although their uniqueness is not
	guaranteed). Thus a compilation step should create its sole
	logfile with the name 'compile', and contribute it to the
	BuildStatus. If a step has two logfiles, try to create them with
	different names (like 'test.log' and 'test.summary'), and only
	contribute the important ones to the overall BuildStatus.
	* buildbot/status/builder.py (Event.getLogs): same
	(BuildStepStatus): fix default .text and .results
	(BuildStepStatus.addLog): switch to list-like .getLogs()
	(BuildStepStatus.stepFinished): same
	(BuildStatus.text): fix default .text
	(BuildStatus.getLogs): temporary hack to return all logs (from all
	child BuildStepStatus objects). Needs to be fixed to only report
	the significant ones (as contributed by the steps themselves)
	* buildbot/test/test_run.py: handle list-like .getLogs()
	* buildbot/test/test_steps.py (BuildStep.testShellCommand1): same

2004-08-28  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/builder.py (Builder.attached): serialize the
	attachment process, so the attach-watcher isn't called until the
	slave is really available. Add detached watchers too, which makes
	testing easier.

	* buildbot/test/test_vc.py: test VC modes (clobber/update/etc)

	* buildbot/test/test_swap.py: remove dead code

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (ShellCommandPP): add debug messages
	(ShellCommand.start): treat errors in _startCommand/spawnProcess
	sort of as if the command being run exited with a -1. There may
	still be some holes in this scheme.
	(CVSCommand): add 'revision' tag to the VC commands, make sure the
	-r option appears before the module list
	* buildbot/process/step.py (CVS): add 'revision' argument

	* buildbot/slave/bot.py (SlaveBuilder._ackFailed): catch failures
	when sending updates or stepComplete messages to the master, since
	we don't currently care whether they arrive or not. When we revamp
	the master/slave protocol to really resume interrupted builds,
	this will need revisiting.
	(lostRemote): remove spurious print

	* buildbot/master.py (BotPerspective.attached): serialize the
	new-builder interrogation process, to make testing easier
	(BotMaster.waitUntilBuilderDetached): convenience function

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuilderStatus): prune old builds
	(BuildStatus.pruneSteps): .. and steps
	(BuildStepStatus.pruneLogs): .. and logs
	(BuilderStatus.getBuild): handle missing builds
	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceBuild.body): display build
	status in the per-build page
	(BuildBox.getBox): color finished builds in the per-build box

2004-08-27  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/mail.py (MailNotifier): new notification class,
	not yet finished

	* buildbot/slave/commands.py (SourceBase): refactor SVN and CVS into
	variants of a common base class which handles all the mode= logic

	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IBuildStatus.getPreviousBuild): add
	convenience method
	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuildStatus.getPreviousBuild): same

2004-08-26  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_slavecommand.py: accomodate new slavecommand
	interfaces

	* buildbot/test/test_run.py: update to new Logfile interface, new
	buildbot.slave modules
	* buildbot/test/test_steps.py: same, remove Swappable, add timeouts

	* MANIFEST.in: new sample config file
	* docs/examples/hello.cfg: same

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py: remove dead import

	* buildbot/process/step.py (RemoteCommand.run): catch errors
	during .start
	(RemoteCommand.remote_update): ignore updates that arrive after
	we've shut down
	(RemoteCommand.remote_complete): ignore duplicate complete msgs
	(RemoteCommand._remoteComplete): cleanup failure handling, reduce
	the responsibilities of the subclass's methods
	(BuildStep.failed): catch errors during failure processing
	(BuildStep.addHTMLLog): provide all-HTML logfiles (from Failures)
	(CVS): move to a mode= argument (described in docstring), rather
	than the ungainly clobber=/export=/copydir= combination.
	(SVN): add mode= functionality to SVN too
	(todo_Darcs, todo_Arch, todo_P4): placeholders for future work

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.startNextStep): catch errors
	during s.startStep()

	* buildbot/clients/base.py: update to new PB client interface.
	gtkPanes is still broken

	* buildbot/bot.py, buildbot/slavecommand.py: move to..
	* buildbot/slave/bot.py, buildbot/slave/commands.py: .. new directory
	* setup.py: add buildbot.slave module
	* buildbot/bb_tap.py: handle move
	* buildbot/slave/registry.py: place to register commands, w/versions
	* buildbot/slave/bot.py: major simplifications
	(SlaveBuilder.remote_startCommand): use registry for slave commands,
	instead of a fixed table. Eventually this will make the slave more
	extensible. Use 'start' method on the command, not .startCommand.
	Fix unsafeTracebacks handling (I think).
	* buildbot/slave/commands.py: major cleanup. ShellCommand is now a
	helper class with a .start method that returns a Deferred.
	SlaveShellCommand is the form reached by the buildmaster. Commands
	which use multiple ShellCommands can just chain them as Deferreds,
	with some helper methods in Command (_abandonOnFailure and
	_checkAbandoned) to bail on rc!=0.
	(CVSCommand): prefer new mode= argument
	(SVNFetch): add mode= argument

	* buildbot/master.py (DebugPerspective.perspective_forceBuild):
	put a useful reason string on the build

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (LogFile): do LogFile right: move the
	core functionality into an IStatusLog object
	(BuildStatus.sendETAUpdate): don't send empty build-eta messages
	* buildbot/status/html.py (TextLog): HTML-rendering goes here
	(StatusResourceBuild.body): use proper accessor methods
	* buildbot/status/client.py (RemoteLog): PB-access goes here
	(StatusClientPerspective.perspective_subscribe): add "full" mode,
	which delivers log contents too
	(PBListener.__cmp__): make PBListeners comparable, thus removeable
	* buildbot/status/event.py: remove old Logfile completely

	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IStatusLog.subscribe): make the
	subscription interface for IStatusLog subscriptions just like all
	other the status subscriptions
	(IStatusReceiver.logChunk): method called on subscribers

2004-08-24  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/builder.py (Builder._pong): oops, ping response
	includes a result (the implicit None returned by remote_print).
	Accept it so the _pong method handles the response correctly.

2004-08-06  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_config.py: update IRC, PBListener tests

	* buildbot/status/client.py (StatusClientPerspective): total
	rewrite to match new IStatus interfaces. New subscription scheme.
	There are still a few optimizations to make (sending down extra
	information with event messages so the client doesn't have to do a
	round trip). The logfile-retrieval code is probably still broken.
	Moved the PB service into its own port, you can no longer share a
	TCP socket between a PBListener and, say, the slaveport (this
	should be fixed eventually).
	* buildbot/clients/base.py (Client): revamp to match. still needs
	a lot of work, but basic event reporting works fine. gtkPanes is
	completely broken.

	* buildbot/status/words.py (IRC): move to c['status']. Each IRC
	instance talks to a single irc server. Threw out all the old
	multi-server handling code. Still need to add back in
	builder-control (i.e. "force build")

	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceBuildStep.body): add some
	more random text to the as-yet-unreachable per-step page

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuildStepStatus.sendETAUpdate):
	rename to stepETAUpdate
	(BuildStatus.subscribe): add build-wide ETA updates
	(BuilderStatus.getState): remove more cruft
	(BuilderStatus.getCurrentBuild): remove more cruft
	(BuilderStatus.buildStarted): really handle tuple-subscription
	* buildbot/test/test_run.py (Status.testSlave): handle the
	stepETAUpdate rename

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster): don't add a default
	StatusClientService. Don't add a default IrcStatusFactory. Both
	are now added through c['status'] in the config file. c['irc'] is
	accepted for backwards compatibility, the only quirk is you cannot
	use c['irc'] to specify IRC servers on ports other than 6667.

	* buildbot/interfaces.py (IBuildStatus.getCurrentStep): add method
	(IStatusReceiver.buildStarted): allow update-interval on subscribe
	(IStatusReceiver.buildETAUpdate): send build-wide ETA updates
	(IStatusReceiver.stepETAUpdate): rename since it's step-specific


	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.startService): SIGHUP now causes
	the buildmaster to re-read its config file


	* buildbot/test/test_web.py (test_webPortnum): need a new hack to
	find out the port our server is running on
	(WebTest.test_webPathname_port): same

	* buildbot/test/test_config.py (testWebPortnum): test it
	(testWebPathname): ditto

	* docs/config.xhtml: document new c['status'] configuration option

	* buildbot/status/html.py (Waterfall): new top-level class which
	can be added to c['status']. This creates the Site as well as the
	necessary TCPServer/UNIXServer. It goes through the BuildMaster,
	reachable as .parent, for everything.

	* buildbot/master.py (Manhole): make it a normal service Child
	(BuildMaster.loadConfig_status): c['status'] replaces webPortnum and
	webPathname. It will eventually replace c['irc'] and the implicit
	PB listener as well. c['webPortnum'] and c['webPathname'] are left
	in as (deprecated) backward compatibility hooks for now.


	* buildbot/process/builder.py (Builder.buildFinished): don't
	inform out builder_status about a finished build, as it finds out
	through its child BuildStatus object

	* buildbot/status/html.py: extensive revamp. Use adapters to make
	Boxes out of BuildStepStatus and friends. Acknowledge that Steps
	have both starting and finishing times and adjust the waterfall
	display accordingly, using spacers if necessary. Use SlaveStatus
	to get buildslave info.
	(StatusResourceBuildStep): new just-one-step resource, used to get
	logfiles. No actual href to it yet.

	* buildbot/status/event.py (Logfile.doSwap): disable Swappable for
	the time being, until I get the file-naming scheme right

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (Event): clean started/finished names
	(BuildStatus.isFinished): .finished is not None is the right test
	(BuildStatus.buildStarted): track started/finished times ourselves
	(BuilderStatus.getSlave): provide access to SlaveStatus object
	(BuilderStatus.getLastFinishedBuild): all builds are now in
	.builds, even the currently-running one. Accomodate this change.
	(BuilderStatus.eventGenerator): new per-builder event generator.
	Returns BuildStepStatus and BuildStatus objects, since they can
	both be adapted as necessary.
	(BuilderStatus.addEvent): clean up started/finished attributes
	(BuilderStatus.startBuild,finishBuild): remove dead code
	(SlaveStatus): new object to provide ISlaveStatus

	* buildbot/process/step.py (ShellCommand.getColor): actually
	return the color instead of setting it ourselves
	(CVS.__init__): pull .timeout and .workdir options out of
	**kwargs, since BuildStep will ignore them. Without this neither
	will be sent to the slave correctly.
	(SVN.__init__): same

	* buildbot/process/builder.py (Builder): move flags to class-level
	attributes
	(Builder.attached): remove .remoteInfo, let the BotPerspective and
	SlaveStatus handle that

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.firstEvent): remove dead code
	(Build.stopBuild): bugfix

	* buildbot/changes/pb.py (PBChangeSource.describe): add method

	* buildbot/changes/changes.py (Change): add IStatusEvent methods
	(ChangeMaster.eventGenerator): yield Changes, since there are now
	Adapters to turn them into HTML boxes

	* buildbot/master.py (BotMaster): track SlaveStatus from BotMaster
	(BotPerspective.attached): feed a SlaveStatus object
	(BuildMaster.loadConfig): add a manhole port (debug over telnet)
	(BuildMaster.loadConfig_Builders): give BuilderStatus a parent

	* buildbot/interfaces.py: API additions
	(ISlaveStatus): place to get slave status

2004-08-04  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/slavecommand.py (DummyCommand.finished): send rc=0 when
	the delay finishes, so the step is marked as SUCCESS

	* buildbot/test/test_run.py (Status.testSlave): cover more of
	IBuildStatus and IBuildStepStatus

	* buildbot/status/progress.py (StepProgress): move some flags to
	class-level attributes
	(StepProgress.remaining): if there are no other progress metrics
	to go by, fall back to elapsed time
	(StepProgress.setExpectations): take a dict of metrics instead of
	a list
	(BuildProgress.setExpectationsFrom): pull expectations from the
	Expectations, instead of having it push them to the BuildProgress
	(Expectations): move some flags to class-level attributes
	(Expectations.__init__): copy per-step times from the
	BuildProgress too
	(Expectations.expectedBuildTime): new method for per-build ETA

	* buildbot/status/event.py (Logfile): move some flags to
	class-level attributes
	(Logfile.logProgressTo): better method name, let step set the
	progress axis name (instead of always being "output")

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuildStepStatus.getTimes): track the
	times directly, rather than depending upon the (possibly missing)
	.progress object. Use 'None' to indicate "not started/finished
	yet"
	(BuildStepStatus.getExpectations): oops, return the full list of
	expectations
	(BuilderStatus._buildFinished): append finished builds to .builds

	* buildbot/process/step.py (BuildStep): add separate .useProgress
	flag, since empty .progressMetrics[] still implies that time is a
	useful predictor
	(CVS): set up the cmd in __init__, instead of waiting for start()

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.startBuild): disable the 'when'
	calculation, this will eventually turn into a proper sourceStamp
	(Build.setupBuild): tell the Progress to load from the Expectations,
	instead of having the Expectations stuff things into the Progress
	(Build.buildException): add a build-level errback to make sure the
	build's Deferred fires even in case of exceptions

	* buildbot/master.py (BotMaster.forceBuild): convey the reason into
	the forced build
	* buildbot/process/builder.py (Builder.forceBuild): convey the
	reason instead of creating a fake Change

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: update to match reality

	* buildbot/test/test_config.py, buildbot/test/test_process.py:
	* buildbot/test/test_run.py, buildbot/test/test_steps.py:
	fix or remove broken/breaking tests

	* buildbot/status/event.py (Logfile.__len__): remove evil method

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (BuildStepStatus.stepStarted): tolerate
	missing .build, for test convenience

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py: import fixes

	* buildbot/process/step.py (BuildStep.failed): exception is FAILURE

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadConfig_Builders): leftover
	.statusbag reference

	* buildbot/bot.py (BuildSlave.stopService): tear down the TCP
	connection at shutdown, and stop it from reconnecting

	* buildbot/test/test_run.py (Run.testSlave): use a RemoteDummy to
	chase down remote-execution bugs

	* buildbot/process/step.py: more fixes, remove
	BuildStep.setStatus()
	* buildbot/status/builder.py: move setStatus() functionality into
	BuildStatus.addStep
	* buildbot/status/event.py: minor fixes

2004-08-03  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/base.py, buildbot/process/builder.py
	* buildbot/process/step.py, buildbot/status/builder.py
	* buildbot/status/event.py, buildbot/test/test_run.py:
	fix status delivery, get a basic test case working
	* buildbot/master.py: finish implementing basic status delivery,
	temporarily disable HTML/IRC/PB status sources

	* buildbot/bot.py (Bot.remote_setBuilderList): remove debug noise

	* buildbot/status/progress.py (BuildProgress): remove dead code

	* buildbot/interfaces.py
	* buildbot/process/base.py, buildbot/process/builder.py
	* buildbot/process/step.py, buildbot/process/step_twisted.py
	* buildbot/status/builder.py: Complete overhaul of the all
	status-delivery code, unifying all types of status clients (HTML,
	IRC, PB). See interfaces.IBuildStatus for an idea of what it will
	look like. This commit is a checkpointing of the work-in-progress:
	the input side is mostly done (Builders/Builds sending status
	to the BuilderStatus/BuildStatus objects), but the output side has
	not yet been started (HTML resources querying BuilderStatus
	objects). Things are probably very broken right now and may remain
	so for several weeks, I apologize for the disruption.

	* buildbot/status/event.py: add a setHTML method to use pre-rendered
	HTML as the log's contents. Currently used for exception tracebacks.
	* buildbot/status/progress.py: minor spelling changes

2004-08-02  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/config.xhtml: XHTML fixes, makes raw .xhtml files viewable
	in mozilla. Also added stylesheets copied from Twisted's docs.
	Remember that these files are meant to be run through Lore first.
	Thanks to Philipp Frauenfelder for the fixes.
	* docs/factories.xhtml, docs/sources.xhtml, docs/steps.xhtml: same
	* docs/stylesheet-unprocessed.css, docs/stylesheet.css: same
	* docs/template.tpl: added a Lore template

2004-07-29  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/interfaces.py: revamp status delivery. This is the
	preview: these are the Interfaces that will be provided by new
	Builder code, and to which the current HTML/IRC/PB status
	displayers will be adapted.

	* buildbot/slavecommand.py (ShellCommand.start): look for .usePTY
	on the SlaveBuilder, not the Bot.
	* buildbot/bot.py (Bot.remote_setBuilderList): copy Bot.usePTY to
	SlaveBuilder.usePTY
	* buildbot/test/test_slavecommand.py (FakeSlaveBuilder.usePTY):
	set .usePTY on the FakeSlaveBuilder

2004-07-25  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/changes/freshcvs.py: add some debug log messages
	(FreshCVSConnectionFactory.gotPerspective): pre-emptively fix the
	disabled 'setFilter' syntax
	(FreshCVSSourceNewcred.__init__): warn about prefix= values that
	don't end with a slash

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Builder._pong_failed): add TODO note

	* setup.py: bump to 0.5.0+ while between releases

2004-07-23  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* setup.py (version): Releasing buildbot-0.5.0

2004-07-23  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* README: update for 0.5.0 release

	* NEWS: update for 0.5.0 release

2004-07-22  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/slavecommand.py (ShellCommand): make usePTY a
	mktap-time configuration flag (--usepty=1, --usepty=0)
	* buildbot/bot.py: same

	* buildbot/master.py (BotPerspective.got_dirs): don't complain about
	an 'info' directory being unwanted

	* buildbot/changes/freshcvs.py (FreshCVSSource): flip the
	newcred/oldcred switch. Newcred (for CVSToys-1.0.10 and later) is now
	the default. To communicate with an oldcred daemond (CVSToys-1.0.9
	and earlier), use a FreshCVSSourceOldcred instead.
	(test): simple test routine: connect to server, print changes

	* buildbot/changes/changes.py (Change.getTime): make it possible
	to print un-timestamped changes

	* buildbot/master.py (makeApp): delete ancient dead code
	(BuildMaster.loadTheConfigFile): make "master.cfg" name configurable
	* buildbot/test/test_config.py (testFindConfigFile): test it

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg (b22w32): use iocp reactor
	instead of win32 one


	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadConfig_Builders): config file
	now takes a dictionary instead of a tuple. See docs/config.xhtml for
	details.

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Builder.__init__): change constructor
	to accept a dictionary of config data, rather than discrete
	name/slave/builddir/factory arguments

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: update to new syntax
	* docs/examples/glib_master.cfg: same
	* buildbot/test/test_config.py (ConfigTest.testBuilders): some
	rough tests of the new syntax

	
	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadConfig): allow webPathname
	to be an int, which means "run a web.distrib sub-server on a TCP
	port". This lets you publish the buildbot status page to a remote
	twisted.web server (using distrib.ResourceSubscription). Also
	rename the local attributes used to hold these web things so
	they're more in touch with reality.
	* buildbot/test/test_web.py: test webPortnum and webPathname
	* docs/config.xhtml: document this new use of webPathname

	* docs/config.xhtml: new document, slightly ahead of reality
	
	* buildbot/changes/freshcvs.py (FreshCVSSourceNewcred.notify): fix
	'prefix' handling: treat it as a simple string to check with
	.startswith, instead of treating it as a directory. This allows
	sub-directories to be used. If you use prefix=, you should give it
	a string that starts just below the CVSROOT and ends with a slash.
	This prefix will be stripped from all filenames, and filenames
	which do not start with it will be ignored.

2004-07-20  Cory Dodt  <corydodt@twistedmatrix.com>

	* contrib/svn_buildbot.py: Add --include (synonym for --filter)
	and --exclude (inverse of --include).  SVN post-commit hooks
	now have total control over which changes get sent to buildbot and which
	do not.

2004-07-10  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/test/test_twisted.py (Case1.testCountFailedTests): fix
	test case to match new API

	* buildbot/status/event.py (Logfile.getEntries): fix silly bug
	which crashed HTML display when self.entries=[] (needed to
	distinguish between [], which means "no entries yet", and None,
	which means "the entries have been swapped out to disk, go fetch
	them").

2004-07-04  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (countFailedTests): Count
	skips, expectedFailures, and unexpectedSuccesses. Start scanning
	10kb from the end because any import errors are wedged there and
	they would make us think the test log was unparseable.
	(RunUnitTests.finishStatus): add skip/todo counts to the event box

2004-06-26  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (RemovePYCs): turn the
	delete-*.pyc command into an actual BuildStep, so we can label it
	nicely
	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py (QuickTwistedBuildFactory):
	(FullTwistedBuildFactory): same

2004-06-25  Cory Dodt  <corydodt@twistedmatrix.com>

	* contrib/fakechange.py: Add an errback when sending the fake 
	change, so we know it didn't work.

2004-06-25  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py: Delete *.pyc files before
	calling trial, so it doesn't catch any old .pyc files whose .py
	files have been moved or deleted.

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (RunUnitTests): 1) Add a new
	parameter, 'recurse', that passes -R to trial. 2) have 'runAll'
	imply 'recurse'. 3) Make the default 'allTests' be ["twisted"]
	instead of ["twisted.test"], so that the end result is "trial -R
	twisted".

	* contrib/svn_buildbot.py: Add a --filter parameter that accepts a
	regular expression to match filenames that should be ignored when
	changed. Also add a --revision parameter that specifies the
	revision to examine, which is useful for debugging.

2004-06-25  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (trialTextSummarizer): create a
	summary of warnings (like DeprecationWarnings), next to the
	"summary" file

2004-05-13  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: enable the win32 builder, as
	we now have a w32 build slave courtesy of Mike Taylor.

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.checkInterlocks): OMG this was
	so broken. Fixed a race condition that tripped up interlocked
	builds and caused the status to be stuck at "Interlocked" forever.
	The twisted buildbot's one interlocked build just so happened to
	never hit this case until recently (the feeding builds both pass
	before the interlocked build is attempted.. usually it has to wait
	a while).
	(Builder._pong_failed): fix method signature

	* setup.py: bump to 0.4.3+ while between releases

2004-04-30  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* setup.py (version): Releasing buildbot-0.4.3

2004-04-30  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* MANIFEST.in: add the doc fragments in  docs/*.xhtml

	* README: update for 0.4.3 release

	* NEWS: update for 0.4.3 release

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.__getstate__): make sure
	Versioned.__getstate__ is invoked, for upgrade from 0.4.2

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (RunUnitTests.trial): add
	.trial as a class attribute, for upgrade from 0.4.2

	* buildbot/changes/changes.py (Change.links): add .links for
	upgrade from 0.4.2

	* buildbot/status/event.py (Logfile.__getstate__): get rid of both
	.textWatchers and .htmlWatchers at save time, since they are both
	volatile, should allow smooth 0.4.2 upgrade

	* buildbot/process/step.py (CVS.finishStatus): catch failed
	CVS/SVN commands so we can make the status box red

2004-04-29  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/changes/freshcvs.py
	(FreshCVSConnectionFactory.gotPerspective): add (commented-out)
	code to do setFilter(), which tells the freshcvs daemon to not
	send us stuff that we're not interested in. I will uncomment it
	when a new version of CVSToys is available in which setFilter()
	actually works, and I get a chance to test it better.

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: start using a PBChangeSource

	* buildbot/master.py (Dispatcher): use a registration scheme
	instead of hardwired service names
	(BuildMaster): keep track of the Dispatcher to support
	registration

	* buildbot/changes/changes.py (ChangeMaster): create a distinct
	PBChangeSource class instead of having it be an undocumented
	internal feature of the ChangeMaster. Split out the code into a
	new file.
	* buildbot/changes/pb.py (PBChangeSource): same
	* buildbot/test/test_changes.py: a few tests for PBChangeSource

	* docs/{factories|sources|steps}.xhtml: document some pieces

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: use SVN instead of CVS, stop
	using FCMaildirSource
	(f23osx): update OS-X builder to use python2.3, since the slave
	was updated to Panther (10.3.3)

2004-03-21  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py: factor out doCheckout, change
	to use SVN instead of CVS

	* buildbot/process/base.py (BasicBuildFactory): refactor to make
	an SVN subclass easier
	(BasicSVN): subclass which uses Subversion instead of CVS

2004-03-15  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* buildbot/slavecommand.py (ShellCommand.start): use COMSPEC instead
	of /bin/sh on win32
	(CVSCommand.cvsComplete): don't assume chdir worked on win32

2004-02-25  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/slavecommand.py (ShellCommand): ['commands'] argument
	is now either a list (which is passed to spawnProcess directly) or
	a string (which gets passed to /bin/sh -c). This removes the useSH
	flag and the ArgslistCommand class. Also send status header at the
	start and end of each command, instead of having the master-side
	code do that.
	(CVSCommand): fix the doUpdate command, it failed to do the 'cp
	-r'. Update to use list-based arguments.
	(SVNFetch): use list-based arguments, use ['dir'] argument to
	simplify code.
	* buildbot/test/test_steps.py (Commands): match changes

	* buildbot/process/step.py (InternalShellCommand.words): handle
	command lists
	(SVN): inherit from CVS, cleanup

	* buildbot/status/event.py (Logfile.content): render in HTML, with
	stderr in red and headers (like the name of the command we're
	about to run) in blue. Add link to a second URL (url + "?text=1")
	to get just stdout/stderr in text/plain without markup. There is
	still a problem with .entries=None causing a crash, it seems to occur
	when the logfile is read before it is finished.

	* buildbot/bot.py (BotFactory.doKeepalive): add a 30-second
	timeout to the keepalives, and use it to explicitly do a
	loseConnection instead of waiting for TCP to notice the loss. This
	ought to clear up the silent-lossage problem.
	(unsafeTracebacks): pass exception tracebacks back to the master,
	makes it much easier to debug problems

2004-02-23  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/slavecommand.py (ShellCommand): add useSH flag to pass
	the whole command to /bin/sh instead of execve [Johan Dahlin]
	(CVSCommand): drop '-r BRANCH' if BRANCH==None instead of usiing
	'-r HEAD' [Johan Dahlin]
	(CVSCommand.start2): fix cvsdir calculation [Johan Dahlin]

	* buildbot/changes/changes.py (Change): add links= argument, add
	asHTML method [Johan Dahlin]. Modified to make a bit more
	XHTMLish. Still not sure how to best use links= .

	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceCommits.getChild): use 
	Change.asHTML to display the change, not asText

	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceBuilder): web button to
	ping slave

	* buildbot/test/test_run.py: test to actually start a buildmaster
	and poke at it

	* MANIFEST.in: bring back accidentally-dropped test helper files

	* buildbot/test/test_config.py (ConfigTest.testSources): skip tests
	that require cvstoys if it is not installed

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (RunUnitTests): allow other
	values of "bin/trial" [Dave Peticolas]
	(RunUnitTests.finishStatus): say "no tests run" instead of "0
	tests passed" when we didn't happen to run any tests

	* buildbot/process/step.py (Compile): use haltOnFailure instead of
	flunkOnFailure [Johan Dahlin]

	* buildbot/process/base.py (ConfigurableBuild.setSteps): allow
	multiple instances of the same Step class by suffixing "_2", etc,
	to the name until it is unique. This name needs to be unique
	because it is used as a key in the dictionary that tracks build
	progress.
	* buildbot/test/test_steps.py (Steps.testMultipleStepInstances):
	add test for it

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Builder.ping): add "ping slave" command

2004-01-14  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcStatusBot): when we leave or get
	kicked from a channel, log it

	* buildbot/master.py (Dispatcher): add "poke IRC" command to say
	something over whatever IRC channels the buildmaster is currently
	connected to. Added to try and track down a problem in which the
	master thinks it is still connected but the IRCd doesn't see it. I
	used a styles.Versioned this time, so hopefully users won't have
	to rebuild their .tap files this time.
	* contrib/debug.glade: add a "Poke IRC" button
	* contrib/debugclient.py: same

	* setup.py: bump to 0.4.2+ while between releases

2004-01-08  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* setup.py (version): Releasing buildbot-0.4.2

2004-01-08  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* NEWS: update for 0.4.2 release

	* README: document how to run the tests, now that they all pass

	* buildbot/changes/maildir.py (Maildir.poll): minor comment

	* buildbot/process/step.py (CVS): add a global_options= argument,
	which lets you set CVS global options for the command like "-r"
	for read-only checkout, or "-R" to avoid writing in the
	repository.
	* buildbot/slavecommand.py (CVSCommand): same

	* buildbot/status/event.py (Logfile): add a .doSwap switch to make
	testing easier (it is turned off when testing, to avoid the
	leftover timer)

	* buildbot/process/step.py (InternalBuildStep): shuffle code a bit
	to make it easier to test: break generateStepID() out to a
	separate function, only update statusbag if it exists.
	(ShellCommands): create useful text for dict-based commands too.

	* test/*, buildbot/test/*: move unit tests under the buildbot/
	directory
	* setup.py (packages): install buildbot.test too

	* buildbot/test/test_slavecommand.py: fix it, tests pass now
	* buildbot/test/test_steps.py: fix it, tests pass now

2004-01-06  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/changes/mail.py (parseFreshCVSMail): looks like new
	freshcvs mail uses a slightly different syntax for new
	directories. Update parser to handle either.
	* test/test_mailparse.py (Test1.testMsg9): test for same

2003-12-21  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py (TwistedDebsBuildFactory): set
	'warnOnWarnings' so that lintian errors mark the build orange

2003-12-17  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/changes/mail.py (parseBonsaiMail): parser for commit
	messages emitted by Bonsai, contributed by Stephen Davis.

	* test/*: moved all tests to use trial instead of unittest. Some
	still fail (test_steps, test_slavecommand, and test_process).

	* setup.py (version): bump to 0.4.1+ while between releases

2003-12-09  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* setup.py (version): Releasing buildbot-0.4.1

2003-12-09  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* NEWS: update for 0.4.1 release

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: add netbsd builder, shuffle
	freebsd builder code a little bit

	* buildbot/changes/freshcvs.py (FreshCVSSourceNewcred.__cmp__):
	don't try to compare attributes of different classes
	* buildbot/changes/mail.py (MaildirSource.__cmp__): same
	(MaildirSource.messageReceived): fix Change delivery

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadConfig): insert 'basedir'
	into the config file's namespace before loading it, like the
	documentation claims it does
	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: remove explicit 'basedir'
	(useFreshCVS): switch to using a maildir until Twisted's freshcvs
	daemon comes back online

2003-12-08  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: provide an explicit 'basedir'
	so the example will work with online=0 as well

	* buildbot/changes/mail.py (FCMaildirSource, SyncmailMaildirSource):
	fix the __implements__ line

	* buildbot/changes/maildirtwisted.py (MaildirTwisted): make this
	class a twisted.application.service.Service, use startService to
	get it moving.

	* buildbot/changes/dnotify.py (DNotify): use os.open to get the
	directory fd instead of simple open(). I'm sure this used to work,
	but the current version of python refuses to open directories with
	open().

2003-12-05  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* setup.py (version): bump to 0.4.0+ while between releases

2003-12-05  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* setup.py (version): Releasing buildbot-0.4.0

2003-12-05  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/examples/glib_master.cfg: replace old sample scripts with
	new-style config files
	* MANIFEST.in: include .cfg files in distribution tarball

	* buildbot/changes/freshcvs.py (FreshCVSListener.remote_goodbye):
	implement a dummy method to avoid the exception that occurs when
	freshcvs sends this to us.

	* buildbot/pbutil.py (ReconnectingPBClientFactory.stopFactory):
	removed the method, as it broke reconnection. Apparently
	stopFactory is called each time the connection attempt fails. Must
	rethink this.
	(ReconnectingPBClientFactory.__getstate__): squash the _callID
	attribute before serialization, since without stopFactory the
	reconnect timer may still be active and they aren't serializable.

	* test/test_mailparse.py (ParseTest): test with 'self' argument

	* buildbot/changes/mail.py (parseFreshCVSMail): add (silly) 'self'
	argument, as these "functions" are invoked like methods from class
	attributes and therefore always get an instance as the first
	argument.

	* buildbot/changes/maildir.py (Maildir.start): fix error in error
	message: thanks to Stephen Davis for the catch

2003-12-04  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/pbutil.py: complete rewrite using PBClientFactory and
	twisted's standard ReconnectingClientFactory. Handles both oldcred
	and newcred connections. Also has a bug-workaround for
	ReconnectingClientFactory serializing its connector when it
	shouldn't.

	* buildbot/bot.py (BotFactory): rewrite connection layer with new
	pbutil. Replace makeApp stuff with proper newcred/mktap
	makeService(). Don't serialize Ephemerals on shutdown.

	* buildbot/changes/changes.py (ChangeMaster): make it a
	MultiService and add the sources as children, to get startService
	and stopService for free. This also gets rid of the .running flag.

	* buildbot/changes/freshcvs.py (FreshCVSSource): rewrite to use
	new pbutil, turn into a TCPClient at the same time (to get
	startService for free). Two variants exist: FreshCVSSourceOldcred
	and FreshCVSSourceNewcred (CVSToys doesn't actualy support newcred
	yet, but when it does, we'll be ready).
	(FreshCVSSource.notify): handle paths which are empty after the
	prefix is stripped. This only happens when the top-level (prefix)
	directory is added, at the very beginning of a Repository's life.

	* buildbot/clients/base.py: use new pbutil, clean up startup code.
	Now the only reconnecting code is in the factory where it belongs.
	(Builder.unsubscribe): unregister the disconnect callback when we
	delete the builder on command from the master (i.e. when the
	buildmaster is reconfigured and that builder goes away). This
	fixes a multiple-delete exception when the status client is shut
	down afterwards.
	* buildbot/clients/gtkPanes.py (GtkClient): cleanup, match the
	base Client. 

	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcStatusBot): add some more sillyness
	(IrcStatusBot.getBuilderStatus): fix minor exception in error message

2003-10-20  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* contrib/run_maxq.py: Accept a testdir as an argument rather than
	a list of globs (ugh). The testdir will be searched for files
	named *.tests and run the tests in the order specified in each of
	those files. This allows for "dependancies" between tests to be
	codified.

	* buildbot/process/maxq.py (MaxQ.__init__): Accept a testdir
	argument to pass to run_maxq.py, instead of a glob.

2003-10-17  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (HLint.start): ignore .xhtml
	files that live in the sandbox

2003-10-15  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (ProcessDocs.finished): fix
	spelling error in "docs" count-warnings output
	(HLint.start): stupid thinko meant .xhtml files were ignored

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg (reactors): disable cReactor
	tests now that cReactor is banished to the sandbox

2003-10-10  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (ProcessDocs, HLint): new Twisted
	scheme: now .xhtml are sources and .html are generated

2003-10-08  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (RunUnitTests.__init__): oops,
	we were ignoring the 'randomly' parameter.

2003-10-01  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/slavecommand.py (ShellCommand.start): set usePTY=1 on
	posix, to kill sub-children of aborted slavecommands.

	* buildbot/status/builder.py: rename Builder to BuilderStatus.
	Clean up initialization: lastBuildStatus remains None until the
	first build has been completed.

	* buildbot/status/html.py (WaterfallStatusResource.body): handle
	None as a lastBuildStatus
	* buildbot/clients/gtkPanes.py: same

	* buildbot/status/client.py (StatusClientService): keep
	BuilderStatus objects in self.statusbags . These objects now live
	here in the StatusClientService and are referenced by the Builder
	object, rather than the other way around.
	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcStatusBot.getBuilderStatus): same
	* buildbot/process/base.py (Builder): same
	* test/test_config.py (ConfigTest.testBuilders): same

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadConfig_Builders): when modifying
	an existing builder, leave the statusbag alone. This will preserve the
	event history.

	* buildbot/pbutil.py (ReconnectingPB.connect): add initial newcred
	hook. This will probably go away in favor of a class in upcoming
	Twisted versions.

	* buildbot/changes/freshcvs.py (FreshCVSSource.start): Remove old
	serviceName from newcred FreshCVSNotifiee setup

2003-09-29  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py: switch to new reactor
	abbreviations
	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: same

	* README (REQUIREMENTS): mention twisted-1.0.8a3 requirement

	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcStatusBot.getBuilder): use the
	botmaster reference instead of the oldapp service lookup

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.__init__): give the
	StatusClientService a reference to the botmaster to make it easier to
	force builds

2003-09-24  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* buildbot/status/html.py (Box.td): escape hreffy things so you
	can have spaces in things like builder names
	(StatusResourceBuilder.body)
	(WaterfallStatusResource.body)
	(WaterfallStatusResource.body0): same

2003-09-25  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadConfig_Builders): don't
	rearrange the builder list when adding or removing builders: keep
	them in the order the user requested.
	* test/test_config.py (ConfigTest.testBuilders): verify it

	* contrib/debug.glade: give the debug window a name

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Builder.buildTimerFired): builders can
	now wait on multiple interlocks. Fix code relating to that.
	(Builder.checkInterlocks): same
	* buildbot/status/builder.py (Builder.currentlyInterlocked): same

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadConfig): move from
	deprecated pb.BrokerFactory to new pb.PBServerFactory
	* test/test_config.py (ConfigTest.testWebPathname): same

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: fix interlock declaration

	* buildbot/master.py (BotMaster.addInterlock): move code to attach
	Interlocks to their Builders into interlock.py .
	(BuildMaster.loadConfig_Interlocks): fix interlock handling

	* test/test_config.py (ConfigTest.testInterlocks): validate
	interlock handling

	(Interlock.deactivate): add .active flag, move the code that
	attaches/detaches builders into the Interlock

2003-09-24  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* buildbot/process/maxq.py (MaxQ): support for running a set of MaxQ
	tests using the new run_maxq.py script, and reporting failures by
	parsing its output.

	* contrib/run_maxq.py: Hacky little script for running a set of maxq
	tests, reporting their success or failure in a buildbot-friendly 
	manner.

2003-09-24  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.cfg: example of a new-style config
	file. This lives in the buildmaster base directory as
	"master.cfg".

	* contrib/debugclient.py (DebugWidget.do_rebuild): add 'reload'
	button to make the master re-read its config file

	* buildbot/master.py (BuildMaster.loadConfig): new code to load
	buildmaster configuration from a file. This file can be re-read
	later, and the buildmaster will update itself to match the new
	desired configuration. Also use new Twisted Application class.
	* test/Makefile, test/test_config.py: unit tests for same

	* buildbot/changes/freshcvs.py (FreshCVSSource.__cmp__): make
	FreshCVSSources comparable, to support reload.
	* buildbot/changes/mail.py (MaildirSource.__cmp__): same

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Builder): make them comparable, make
	Interlocks easier to attach, to support reload. Handle
	re-attachment of remote slaves.
	* buildbot/process/interlock.py (Interlock): same

	* buildbot/bot.py, bb_tap.py, changes/changes.py: move to
	Twisted's new Application class. Requires Twisted >= 1.0.8 .
	buildmaster taps are now constructed with mktap.
	* buildbot/status/client.py (StatusClientService): same

	* buildbot/status/words.py: move to new Services, add support to
	connect to multiple networks, add reload support, allow nickname
	to be configured on a per-network basis

2003-09-20  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.py (twisted_app): use python2.3 for
	the freebsd builder, now that the machine has been upgraded and no
	longer has python2.2

	* setup.py (version): bump to 0.3.5+ while between releases

2003-09-19  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* setup.py (version): Releasing buildbot-0.3.5

2003-09-19  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* NEWS: add post-0.3.4 notes

	* README (REQUIREMENTS): note twisted-1.0.7 requirement

	* MANIFEST.in: add contrib/*

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.py (twisted_app): all build slaves must
	use a remote root now: cvs.twistedmatrix.com

	* buildbot/changes/freshcvs.py (FreshCVSNotifiee.connect): update
	to newcred
	(FreshCVSNotifieeOldcred): but retain a class that uses oldcred for
	compatibility with old servers
	(FreshCVSSource.start): and provide a way to use it
	(FreshCVSNotifiee.disconnect): handle unconnected notifiee

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.py (twisted_app): update to new
	makeApp interface.
	(twisted_app): listen on new ~buildbot socket
	(twisted_app): Twisted CVS has moved to cvs.twistedmatrix.com

	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py: Use 'copydir' on CVS steps
	to reduce cvs bandwidth (update instead of full checkout)

2003-09-11  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* contrib/fakechange.py: demo how to connect to the changemaster
	port. You can use this technique to submit changes to the
	buildmaster from source control systems that offer a hook to run a
	script when changes are committed.

	* contrib/debugclient.py: tool to connect to the debug port. You
	can use it to force builds, submit fake changes, and wiggle the
	builder state

	* buildbot/master.py: the Big NewCred Reorganization. Use a single
	'Dispatcher' realm to handle all the different kinds of
	connections and Perspectives: buildslaves, the changemaster port,
	the debug port, and the status client port. NewCredPerspectives
	now have .attached/.detached methods called with the remote 'mind'
	reference, much like old perspectives did. All the pb.Services
	turned into ordinary app.ApplicationServices .
	(DebugService): went away, DebugPerspectives are now created
	directly by the Dispatcher.
	(makeApp): changed interface a little bit

	* buildbot/changes/changes.py: newcred
	* buildbot/status/client.py: newcred

	* buildbot/clients/base.py: newcred client side changes
	* buildbot/bot.py: ditto

	* docs/examples/glib_master.py: handle new makeApp() interface
	* docs/examples/twisted_master.py: ditto

	* buildbot/pbutil.py (NewCredPerspective): add a helper class to
	base newcred Perspectives on. This should go away once Twisted
	itself provides something sensible.


2003-09-11  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* contrib/svn_buildbot.py: A program that you can call from your
	SVNREPO/hooks/post-commit file that will notify a BuildBot master
	when a change in an SVN repository has happened. See the top of
	the file for some minimal usage info.

2003-09-10  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* buildbot/slavecommand.py (ArglistCommand): Add new
	ArglistCommand that takes an argument list rather than a string as
	a parameter. Using a st.split() for argv is very bad.

	* buildbot/slavecommand.py (SVNFetch): Now has the ability to
	update to a particular revision rather than always checking out
	(still not very smart about it, there may be cases where the
	checkout becomes inconsistent).

2003-09-10  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* buildbot/{bot.py,slavecommand.py,process/step.py}: Rudimentary
	SVN fetch support. It can checkout (not update!) a specified
	revision from a specified repository to a specified directory.

	* buildbot/status/progress.py (Expectations.update): Fix an
	obvious bug (apparently created by the change described in the
	previous ChangeLog message) by moving a check to *after* the
	variable it checks is defined.


2003-09-08  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/progress.py (Expectations.update): hack to catch
	an exception TTimo sees: sometimes the update() method seems to
	get called before the step has actually finished, so the .stopTime
	is not set, so no totalTime() is available and we average None
	with the previous value. Catch this and just don't update the
	metrics, and emit a log message.

2003-08-24  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/base.py (BasicBuildFactory): accept 'cvsCopy'
	parameter to set copydir='original' in CVS commands.

	* buildbot/process/step.py (CVS): accept 'copydir' parameter.

	* buildbot/slavecommand.py (CVSCommand): add 'copydir' parameter,
	which tells the command to maintain a separate original-source CVS
	workspace. For each build, this workspace will be updated, then
	the tree copied into a new workdir. This reduces CVS bandwidth
	(from a full checkout to a mere update) while doubling the local
	disk usage (to keep two copies of the tree).

2003-08-21  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/event.py (Logfile.addEntry): if the master web
	server dies while we're serving a page, request.write raises
	pb.DeadReferenceError . Catch this and treat it like a
	notifyFinish event by dropping the request.

2003-08-18  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcStatusBot.command_FORCE): complain
	(instead of blowing up) if a force-build command is given without
	a reason field

	* buildbot/changes/changes.py (ChangeMaster.getChangeNumbered):
	don't blow up if there aren't yet any Changes in the list

2003-08-02  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/bot.py (updateApplication): don't set the .tap name,
	since we shouldn't assume we own the whole .tap file

	* buildbot/bb_tap.py (updateApplication): clean up code, detect
	'mktap buildbot' (without a subcommand) better

2003-07-29  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/words.py
	(IrcStatusFactory.clientConnectionLost): when we lose the
	connection to the IRC server, schedule a reconnection attempt.

	* buildbot/slavecommand.py (CVSCommand.doClobber): on non-posix,
	use shutil.rmtree instead of forking off an "rm -rf" command.
	rmtree may take a while and will block until it finishes, so we
	use "rm -rf" if available.

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.py: turn off kqreactor, it hangs
	freebsd buildslave badly

	* setup.py (version): bump to 0.3.4+ while between releases

2003-07-28  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* setup.py (version): Releasing buildbot-0.3.4

2003-07-28  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* NEWS: update in preparation for release

	* buildbot/slavecommand.py (ShellCommand.doTimeout): use
	process.signalProcess instead of os.kill, to improve w32
	portability

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.py (twisted_app): turn off
	win32eventreactor: the tests hang the buildslave badly

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.buildFinished): update ETA even on
	failed builds, since usually the failures are consistent

	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py (TwistedReactorsBuildFactory):
	add compileOpts/compileOpts2 to reactors build

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.py (twisted_app): add "-c mingw32"
	(twisted_app): use both default and win32eventreactor on w32 build.
	Use both default and kqreactor on freebsd build.

	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py (FullTwistedBuildFactory):
	add compileOpts2, which is put after the build_ext argument. w32
	needs "-c mingw32" here.

	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceBuilder.getChild): don't
	touch .acqpath, it goes away in recent Twisted releases

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.py (twisted_app): use "python" for
	the w32 buildslave, not "python2.2"

	* buildbot/bot.py (Bot.remote_getSlaveInfo): only look in info/ if
	the directory exists.. should hush an exception under w32

	* buildbot/slavecommand.py (ShellCommandPP.processEnded): use
	ProcessTerminated -provided values for signal and exitCode rather
	than parsing the unix status code directly. This should remove one
	more roadblock for a w32-hosted buildslave.

	* test/test_mailparse.py: add test cases for Syncmail parser

	* Buildbot/changes/freshcvsmail.py: remove leftover code, leave a
	temporary compatibility import. Note! Start importing
	FCMaildirSource from changes.mail instead of changes.freshcvsmail

	* buildbot/changes/mail.py (parseSyncmail): finish Syncmail parser

2003-07-27  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* NEWS: started adding new features

	* buildbot/changes/mail.py: start work on Syncmail parser, move
	mail sources into their own file

	* buildbot/changes/freshcvs.py (FreshCVSNotifiee): mark the class
	as implementing IChangeSource
	* buildbot/changes/freshcvsmail.py (FCMaildirSource): ditto

	* buildbot/interfaces.py: define the IChangeSource interface

2003-07-26  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/master.py (makeApp): docstring (thanks to Kevin Turner)

2003-06-25  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/words.py (IrcStatusBot.emit_last): round off
	seconds display

2003-06-17  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/words.py: clean up method usage to avoid error
	in silly IRC command
	(IrcStatusBot.emit_status): round off seconds display

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build): delete the timer when saving
	to the .tap file, and restore it (if it should still be running)
	upon restore. This should fix the "next build in -34 seconds"
	messages that result when the master is restarted while builds are
	sitting in the .waiting slot. If the time for the build has
	already passed, start it very soon (in 1 second).

	* buildbot/status/words.py: more silly commands

	* README (REQUIREMENTS): add URLs to all required software

	* buildbot/status/words.py ('last'): mention results of, and time
	since last build

2003-05-28  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/words.py: add 'last' command
	(IrcStatusBot.emit_status): add current-small text to 'status' output

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.py (twisted_app): turn on IRC bot
	(twisted_app): remove spaces from OS-X builder name

	* buildbot/master.py (makeApp): add knob to turn on IRC bot
	* buildbot/status/words.py: IRC bot should actually be useful now

2003-05-23  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/bot.py (Bot.remote_getSlaveInfo): add routines to get
	"slave information" from $(slavedir)/info/* . These files are
	maintained by the slave administrator, and describe the
	machine/environment that is hosting the slave. Information from
	them is put into the "Builder" HTML page. Still need to establish
	a set of well-known filenames and meanings for this data: at the
	moment, *all* info/* files are sent to the master, but only
	'admin' and 'host' are used on that end.
	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResourceBuilder.body): ditto
	* buildbot/process/base.py (Builder.setRemoteInfo):  ditto
	* buildbot/master.py (BotPerspective.got_info):  ditto

2003-05-22  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* setup.py (version): bump version to 0.3.3+ while between releases

2003-05-21  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* setup.py: Releasing buildbot-0.3.3

2003-05-21  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* NEWS: 0.3.3 news items

	* README: describe --keepalive and life behind a NAT box

	* buildbot/bot.py (Bot.connected): implement application-level
	keepalives to deal with NAT timeouts, turn them on with
	--keepalive option or when SO_KEEPALIVE doesn't work.

	* buildbot/master.py (BotPerspective): accept keepalives silently

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.buildException): CopiedFailures
	don't carry as much information as local ones, so don't try to
	create a big HTMLized version of them.

	* buildbot/process/step.py (InternalShellCommand.stepFailed): close
	log file when step fails due to an exception, such as when the slave
	becomes unreachable

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (RunUnitTests): use trial's new
	--testmodule argument instead of grepping for test-case-name tags
	ourselves. Remove FindUnitTests code.
	* buildbot/slavecommand.py, buildbot/bot.py: remove old code

	* MANIFEST.in: Add docs/examples, files under test/ . Oops!

2003-05-16  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/base.py (BasicBuildFactory): add 'configureEnv'
	argument to allow things like CFLAGS=-O0 to be passed without relying
	upon /bin/sh processing on the slave.

	* buildbot/process/step.py (InternalShellCommand.start): send
	'env' dict to slave
	* buildbot/slavecommand.py (ShellCommand.start): create argv with
	'split' instead of letting /bin/sh do it. This should also remove
	the need for /bin/sh on the buildslave, making it more likely to
	work with win32.

	* buildbot/status/html.py: html-escape text in blamelist.
	Add "force build" button to the Builder page.

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (countFailedTests): look at
	last 1000 characters for status line, as import errors can put it
	before the -200 point.

2003-05-15  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.py: use clobber=0 for remote builds

	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py (FullTwistedBuildFactory):
	make 'clobber' a parameter, so it is possible to have builds which
	do full tests but do a cvs update instead of hammering the CVS
	server with a full checkout each build

	* buildbot/process/step.py (InternalShellCommand): bump default
	timeout to 20 minutes

	* buildbot/bot.py (Bot.debug_forceBuild): utility method to ask
	the master to trigger a build. Run it via manhole.

	* buildbot/master.py (BotPerspective.perspective_forceBuild):
	allow slaves to trigger any build that they host, to make life
	easier for slave admins who are testing out new build processes

	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py (TwistedReactorsBuildFactory):
	don't flunk cReactor or qtreactor on failure, since they fail alot
	these days. Do warnOnFailure instead.

	* buildbot/process/base.py: change Builder.buildable from a list
	into a single slot. When we don't have a slave, new builds (once
	they make it past the timeout) are now merged into an existing
	buildable one instead of being queued. With this change, a slave
	which has been away for a while doesn't get pounded with all the
	builds it missed, but instead just does a single build.

2003-05-07  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* setup.py (version): bump version to 0.3.2+ while between releases

2003-05-07  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* setup.py: Releasing buildbot-0.3.2

2003-05-07  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* setup.py: fix major packaging error: include subdirectories!
	
	* NEWS: add changes since last release

	* README (REQUIREMENTS): update twisted/python dependencies

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (Builder.startBuild): change
	BuildProcess API: now they should call startBuild/finishBuild
	instead of pushing firstEvent / setLastBuildStatus. Moving towards
	keeping a list of builds in the statusbag, to support other kinds of
	status delivery.
	(Builder.addClient): send current-activity-small to new clients
	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build.startBuild, .buildFinished): use
	new API

	* buildbot/status/client.py: drop RemoteReferences at shutdown

	* buildbot/status/event.py (Event.stoppedObserving): oops, add it

	* buildbot/status/progress.py (BuildProgress.remote_subscribe):
	more debug messages for remote status client

	* buildbot/process/step.py (InternalBuildStep.stepComplete)
	(.stepFailed): only fire the Deferred once, even if both
	stepComplete and stepFailed are called. I think this can happen if
	an exception occurs at a weird time.

	* buildbot/status/words.py: work-in-progress: IRC status delivery

2003-05-05  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.py (twisted_app): hush internal
	python2.3 distutils deprecation warnings
	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py (FullTwistedBuildFactory):
	add compileOpts= argument which inserts extra args before the
	"setup.py build_ext" command. This can be used to give -Wignore
	warnings, to hush some internal python-2.3 deprecation messages.
 
	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (RunUnitTests): parameterize
	the ['twisted.test'] default test case to make it easier to change
	in subclasses

	* buildbot/clients/base.py: switch to pb.Cacheable-style Events
	* buildbot/clients/gtkPanes.py: ditto

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (RunUnitTests): use randomly=
	arg to collapse RunUnitTestsRandomly into RunUnitTests
	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py (FullTwistedBuildFactory):
	use RunUnitTests(randomly=1) instead of RunUnitTestsRandomly

	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResource): shuffle Resources
	around to fix a bug: both 'http://foo:8080' and 'http://foo:8080/'
	would serve the waterfall display, but the internal links were
	only valid on the trailing-slash version. The correct behavior is
	for the non-slashed one to serve a Redirect to the slashed one.
	This only shows up when the buildbot page is hanging off another
	server, like a Twisted-Web distributed server.

	* buildbot/status/event.py (Event, RemoteEvent): make Events
	pb.Cacheable, with RemoteEvent as the cached version. This removes
	a lot of explicit send-an-update code.
	* buildbot/status/builder.py (Builder): remove send-update code
	* buildbot/status/client.py (ClientBuilder): remove send-update
	code, and log errors that occur during callRemote (mostly to catch
	InsecureJelly exceptions)

	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py (QuickTwistedBuildFactory):
	run Lore with the same python used in the rest of the build

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted2.py (RunUnitTestsJelly): moved

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (HLint): accept 'python'
	argument. Catch rc!=0 and mark the step as failed. This marks the
	build orange ("has warnings").
	(RunUnitTestsJelly): move out to step_twisted2.py

	* buildbot/util.py (ignoreStaleRefs): add utility function

	* buildbot/master.py (DebugPerspective.perspective_setCurrentState):
	don't fake ETA object, it's too hard to get right

2003-05-02  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.py (twisted_app): add FreeBSD builder

2003-05-01  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResource.body): oops, I was
	missing a <tr>, causing the waterfall page to be misrendered in
	everything except Galeon.

2003-04-29  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.py: make debuild use python-2.2
	explicitly, now that Twisted stopped supporting 2.1

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (BuildDebs.finishStatus): oops,
	handle tuple results too. I keep forgetting this, which suggests
	it needs to be rethought.

	* setup.py (setup): bump version to 0.3.1+ while between releases

	* setup.py: Releasing buildbot-0.3.1

2003-04-29  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* README (SUPPORT): add plea to send questions to the mailing list

	* NEWS, MANIFEST.in: add description of recent changes

	* docs/examples/twisted_master.py: add the code used to create the
	Twisted buildmaster, with passwords and such removed out to a
	separate file.

	* buildbot/changes/changes.py, freshcvs.py, freshcvsmail.py: split
	out cvstoys-using bits from generic changes.py, to allow non-cvstoys
	buildmasters to not require CVSToys be installed.
	* README, docs/examples/glib_master: update to match the change

	* buildbot/clients/base.py, buildbot/bot.py,
	buildbot/changes/changes.py, buildbot/pbutil.py: copy
	ReconnectingPB from CVSToys distribution to remove CVSToys
	dependency for build slaves and status clients. Buildmasters which
	use FreshCVSSources still require cvstoys be installed, of course.

2003-04-25  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py (FullTwistedBuildFactory): add
	runTestsRandomly arg to turn on trial -z

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (TwistedJellyTestResults):
	experimental code to use trial's machine-parseable output to get
	more detailed test results. Still has some major issues.
	(RunUnitTestsRandomly): subclass to add "-z 0" option, runs tests
	in random sequence

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (Builder.setCurrentBuild):
	anticipating moving build history into statusbag, not used yet

	* buildbot/status/tests.py: code to centralize test results,
	doesn't work quite yet

	* buildbot/status/event.py (Event): use hasattr("setName") instead
	of isinstance for now.. need better long-term solution

	* buildbot/status/html.py: Remove old imports

2003-04-24  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py (TwistedBuild.isFileImportant):
	ignore changes under doc/fun/ and sandbox/

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py: update pushEvent and friends.

	* buildbot/status/html.py (Box.td): replace event.buildername with
	event.parent.getSwappableName(). Needs more thought.

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (Builder): Replace pushEvent and
	getLastEvent with {set|update|addFileTo|finish}CurrentActivity.
	Tell events they are being pruned with event.delete().

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Build): Remove Builder status-handling
	methods. s/pushEvent/setCurrentActivity/.

	* buildbot/process/step.py (BuildStep): clean up status delivery.
	Gouse builder.statusbag methods instead of intermediate builder
	methods. s/updateLastEvent/updateCurrentActivity/.
	s/finalizeLastEvent/finishCurrentActivity/. Use
	addFileToCurrentActivity for summaryFunction.

	* buildbot/status/event.py (Logfile): put data in a Swappable when
	.finish is called.
	(Event): add more setter methods. Remove .buildername, use .parent
	and getSwappableName instead (needs more thought).

	* buildbot/util.py (Swappable):
	* test/test_swap.py: don't bother setting filename at __init__
	time, do it later. Change setFilename args to take parent first,
	since it provides the most significant part of the filename.

2003-04-23  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/status/event.py (Logfile.addEntry): append to previous
	entry, if possible

	* buildbot/process/step.py (BuildStep.finalizeLastEvent):
	anticipating Swappable
	(InternalShellCommand.remoteUpdate): split out various log-adding
	methods so subclasses can snarf stdout separately

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Builder.finalizeLastEvent): more code
	in anticipation of Swappable build logs
	(Builder.testsFinished): anticipating TestResults, still disabled

	* buildbot/status/builder.py (Builder.pruneEvents): only keep the
	last 100 events

	* buildbot/status/event.py (Logfile): add (disabled) support for
	Swappable, not ready for use yet

	* buildbot/util.py (Swappable): object which is swapped out to
	disk after some period of no use.
	* test/test_swap.py: test buildbot.utils.Swappable

2003-04-14  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Builder.doPeriodicBuild): add simple
	periodic-build timer. Set the .periodicBuildTime on a builder
	instance to some number of seconds to activate it.

	* buildbot/master.py (BotMaster.forceBuild): change forceBuild API

	* buildbot/process/step.py (ShellCommand.finishStatus): use log.msg in
	a way that survives result tuples

2003-04-12  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step.py (ShellCommand.finishStatusSummary):
	return a dict instead of a tuple: allow summarizers to provide
	multiple summaries if they want
	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (trialTextSummarizer): return dict
	(debuildSummarizer): summarize lintian warnings/errors

2003-04-10  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* README (REQUIREMENTS): slave requires twisted-1.0.4a2

2003-04-09  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (trialTextSummarizer): Don't create
	empty summaries: happens when the tests fail so hard they don't emit
	a parseable summary line.

	* buildbot/process/step.py (ShellCommand.finishStatusSummary):
	Allow summaryFunction to return None to indicate no summary should
	be added.
 
	* buildbot/status/event.py (Logfile.removeHtmlWatcher): avoid
	writing to stale HTTP requests: notice when they disconnect and
	remove the request from the list. Also add CacheToFile from
	moshez, will be used later.

2003-04-08  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (ProcessDocs.finished): warnings
	should be an int, not a list of strings

	* buildbot/changes/changes.py (FreshCVSSource.stop): don't disconnect
	if we weren't actually connected

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (trialTextSummarizer): function
	to show the tail end of the trial text output

	* buildbot/process/step.py (ShellCommand.finishStatusSummary): add
	hook to summarize the results of a ShellCommand

2003-04-07  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	buildslave .tap files

2003-03-28  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step.py (InternalShellCommand.finished): handle
	new tuple result values (fix embarrasing bug that appeared during
	PyCon demo)

2003-03-27  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* docs/examples/glib_master.py, README: add sample buildmaster.tap
	-making program

2003-03-25  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step.py (CVS, ShellCommand): add reason for failure
	to overall build status
	* buildbot/clients/base.py (Builder): improve event printing
	* buildbot/process/base.py (BasicBuildFactory): use specific steps
	instead of generic ShellCommand
	(Build): Add .stopBuild, use it when slave is detached

	* buildbot/process/step.py (Configure,Test): give the steps their
	own names and status strings

	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResource): add "show" argument,
	lets you limit the set of Builders being displayed.

2003-03-20  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/basic.py: removed

2003-03-19  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/process_twisted.py (FullTwistedBuildFactory):
	turn off process-docs by default

	* buildbot/process/base.py (Builder.getBuildNumbered): Don't blow up
	when displaying build information without anything in allBuilds[]

	* buildbot/bot.py (makeApp): really take password from sys.argv

2003-03-18  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/bot.py (buildApp): take password from sys.argv

	* README: replace with more useful text

	* setup.py: add a real one
	* MANIFEST.in, .cvsignore: more distutils packaging stuff
	
	* docs/PyCon-2003/: added sources for PyCon paper.

	* buildbot/process/base.py, step.py: revamp. BuildProcess is gone,
	now Build objects control the process and Builder only handles
	slave stuff and distribution of changes/status. A new BuildFactory
	class creates Build objects on demand.

	Created ConfigurableBuild which takes a list of steps to run. This
	makes it a lot easier to set up a new kind of build and moves us
	closer to being able to configure a build from a web page.

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py, process_twisted.py: move to
	new model. A lot of code went away.
	
	* buildbot/status/progress.py (BuildProgress.newProgress): Don't
	send lots of empty progress messages to the client.

	* buildbot/master.py (makeApp): enforce builder-name uniqueness

2003-02-20  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py (BuildDebs): count lintian hits

	* buildbot/slavecommand.py (ShellCommand): back to usePTY=0. The
	Twisted bug that prevented non-pty processes from working just got
	fixed, and the bug that leaks ptys is still being investigated.

	* buildbot/process/step.py (CVS): send timeout arg to slave

	* buildbot/clients/gtkPanes.py: add connection-status row, handle
	builders coming and going
	* buildbot/clients/base.py: clean up protocol, move to ReconnectingPB
	from CVSToys, handle lost-buildmaster

	* buildbot/status/client.py (StatusClientService.removeBuilder):
	Clean up status client protocol: send builders (with references)
	as they are created, rather than sending a list and requiring the
	client to figure out which ones are new.
	* buildbot/master.py (BotMaster.forceBuild): Log debugclient
	attempts to force a build on an unknown builder

2003-02-19  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/slavecommand.py (CVSCommand): add timeout to sub-commands
	* buildbot/slavecommand.py (ShellCommand.start): stop using PTYs until
	Twisted stops leaking them.
	* buildbot/clients/gtkPanes.py (CompactBuilder): forget ETA when the
	builder goes to an idle state.

	* buildbot/slavecommand.py (ShellCommand.start): bring back PTYs until
	I figure out why CVS commands hang without them, and/or I fix the
	hung-command timeout

2003-02-16  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* buildbot/process/step_twisted.py: bin/hlint went away, replace
	with 'bin/lore --output lint'. Use 'bin/trial -o' to remove
	ansi-color markup. Remove GenerateLore step. Count hlint warnings in
	GenerateDocs now that they are prefixed with WARNING:.

	* buildbot/status/html.py (StatusResource.body): Fix Builder link,
	use manual href target instead of request.childLink

	* buildbot/clients/gtkPanes.py: Fix progress countdown: update the
	display every second, but update the ETA every 5 seconds (or
	whenever) as remote_progress messages arrive.
