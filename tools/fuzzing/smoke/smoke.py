""" Smoke test script for Fuzzing

This script can be used to perform simple calls using `jsshell`
or whatever other tools you may add.

The call is done via `taskcluster/ci/fuzzing/kind.yml` and
files contained in the `target.jsshell.zip` and `target.fuzztest.tests.tar.gz`
build artifacts are downloaded to run things.

Everything included in this directory will be added in
`target.fuzztest.tests.tar.gz` at build time, so you can add more scripts and
tools if you need. They will be located in `$MOZ_FETCHES_DIR` and follow the
same directory structure than the source tree.
