# It is used by 'mach static-analysis' and 'phabricator static-analysis bot'
# in order to have consistency across the used checkers.
# All the clang checks used by the static-analysis tools.
#
# To add a new checker:
# 1. Add it in this file
# 2. Create a C/C++ test case in tools/clang-tidy/test/ reproducing the
#    warning/error that the checker will detect
# 3. Run './mach static-analysis autotest -d' to create the reference
# 4. Check the json file in tools/clang-tidy/test/
# 5. Commit this file + the .cpp test case + the json result
platforms:
  - linux64
  - macosx64
  - win32
  - win64
# Minimum clang-tidy version that is required for all the following checkers
# to work properly.
# This is also used by 'mach clang-format'
