#
#   This file contains hard ordering rules for use with module-graph.pl's
#       --force-order command line option.
#
#   This file is hand crafted.
#
#   Each line contains two module names seperated by whitespace.
#   If both modules are in the needed modules as defined by module-graph.pl,
#       then the first module will always proceed the second module.
#   Module order is not changed otherwise.
#
#   Note:   This file is processed line by line in sequential manner.
#           The consequences of adding multiple rules containing modules that
#               appear in previous rules is left as an excercise to the
#               reader.
#           So long as you realize earlier lines are applied first, then
#               you can figure it out.
