These certificates are imported from mozilla-central (https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/toolkit/mozapps/update/updater)
and used to support staging update verify jobs. These jobs end up replacing the certificates within the binaries
(through a binary search and replace), and must all be the same length for this to work correctly. If we recreate
these certificates, and the resulting public certificates are not the same length anymore, the commonName may be
changed to line them up again. https://github.com/google/der-ascii is a useful tool for doing this. For example:

To convert the certificate to ascii:
der2ascii -i dep1.der -o dep1.ascii

Then use your favourite editor to change the commonName field. That block will look something like:
    SEQUENCE {
      SET {
        SEQUENCE {
          # commonName
          OBJECT_IDENTIFIER { 2.5.4.3 }
          PrintableString { "CI MAR signing key 1" }
        }
      }
    }

You can pad the PrintableString with spaces to increase the length of the cert (1 space = 1 byte).

Then, convert back to der:
ascii2der -i dep1.ascii -o newdep1.der

The certificats in the sha1 subdirectory are from
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/0fcbe72581bc/toolkit/mozapps/update/updater
which are the SHA-1 certs from before they where updated in Bug 1105689. They only include the release 
certs, since the nightly certs are different length, and we only care about updates from old ESRs.
