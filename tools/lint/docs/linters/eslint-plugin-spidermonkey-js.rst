==============================
Mozilla ESLint SpiderMonkey JS
==============================

This plugin only creates one item at the moment - a processor for the SpiderMonkey
JS code.

Processors
==========

The processor is used to pre-process all *.js files and deals with the macros
that SpiderMonkey uses.

Note: Currently the ESLint option --fix is disabled when the preprocessor is
enabled.
