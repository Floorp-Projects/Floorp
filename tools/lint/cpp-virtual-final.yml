    #   virtual void Bad1() final
    #   void Bad2() final override
    #   void Bad3() override final
    #
    # Caveats: This lint ...
    #
    #   * Doesn't warn about `virtual void NotBad() override` at this time
    #     because there are currently 6963 instances of this pattern.
    #
    #   * Doesn't warn about function declarations that span multiple lines
    #     because the regex can't match across line breaks.
