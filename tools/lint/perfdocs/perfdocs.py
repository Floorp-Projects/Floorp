def run_perfdocs(config, logger=None, paths=None, generate=True):
    """
    Build up performance testing documentation dynamically by combining
    text data from YAML files that reside in `perfdoc` folders
    across the `testing` directory. Each directory is expected to have
    an `index.rst` file along with `config.yml` YAMLs defining what needs
    to be added to the documentation.

    The YAML must also define the name of the "framework" that should be
    used in the main index.rst for the performance testing documentation.

    The testing documentation list will be ordered alphabetically once
    it's produced (to avoid unwanted shifts because of unordered dicts
    and path searching).

    Note that the suite name headings will be given the H4 (---) style so it
    is suggested that you use H3 (===) style as the heading for your
    test section. H5 will be used be used for individual tests within each
    suite.

    Usage for verification: ./mach lint -l perfdocs
    Usage for generation: ./mach lint -l perfdocs --fix

    For validation, see the Verifier class for a description of how
    it works.

    The run will fail if the valid result from validate_tree is not
    False, implying some warning/problem was logged.

    :param dict config: The configuration given by mozlint.
    :param StructuredLogger logger: The StructuredLogger instance to be used to
        output the linting warnings/errors.
    :param list paths: The paths that are being tested. Used to filter
        out errors from files outside of these paths.
    :param bool generate: If true, the docs will be (re)generated.
