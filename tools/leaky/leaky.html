<h2>
About Leaky</h2>
Leaky is a program which will help you find memory leaks, and as of late,
help you debug reference count problems with xpcom objects.
<p>To use leaky you must first build it. I've made it work only on x86
linux. To work on other platforms you will need to:
<ol>
<li>
Implement CrawlStack in libmalloc.cpp</li>

<li>
Implement DumpAddressMap in libmalloc.cpp and in ShowLibs.cpp</li>

<li>
Either support LD_PRELOAD in your dynamic linker *or* produce a library
that wraps your libc malloc (see config.h for some clues)</li>

<li>
Implement symbol table reading code (see coff.cpp, elf.cpp and bfd.cpp
for examples; at the time of writing this document only bfd.cpp was known
to work)</li>
</ol>

After its built, you can use TestPreload and TestMalloc and ShowLibs to
debug your implementation.
<p>By setting the LIBMALLOC_LOG environment variable you control how much
information is logged during the programs execution. See libmalloc.h for
a definition of the values to use. If you are using LD_PRELOAD, here is
one way to run your program:
<blockquote><tt>env LD_PRELOAD=/full/path/to/libleaky.so LIBMALLOC_LOG=1
my-program</tt></blockquote>
The debugging malloc library creates two files - "malloc-log" and "malloc-map".
The malloc-log file can be quite large for large programs (e.g. mozilla)
so be prepared to have alot of disk space. The malloc-map is tiny.
<p>Once your program has completed execution you can use leaky to look
for memory leaks, or at least use it to dump the log. For memory leaks,
you use leaky like this:
<blockquote><tt>leaky -d &lt;program-name-goes-here> malloc-log</tt></blockquote>
Leaky will then display all of the call sites where memory was leaked.
To look at the entire log file contents, not just the leaks add "-a" to
the arguments:
<blockquote><tt>leaky -d -a &lt;program-name-goes-here> malloc-log</tt></blockquote>
For debugging reference count issues, here is what I&nbsp;do:
<ol>
<li>
Set LIBMALLOC_LOG&nbsp;to "8"</li>

<li>
Modify your source code so that your class::Addref and class::Release methods
call __log_addref and __log_release, as appropriate. See libmalloc.h for
their signatures.</li>

<li>
Run your program so that you get the log data. Its often convenient to
run your program in the debugger and then set a breakpoint at an interesting
location where you think some object is being leaked or over-freed. Then
when the debugger gets there tell it to execute DumpAddressMap. In gdb
you do this:</li>

<ol><tt></tt>&nbsp;
<br><tt>(gdb)&nbsp;p DumpAddressMap()</tt>
<br><tt></tt>&nbsp;</ol>

<li>
Then use leaky to capture the addref and release calls to a log file:</li>

<ol>&nbsp;
<br><tt>leaky -d -a &lt;program-name-goes-here>&nbsp;malloc-log >&nbsp;log</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</ol>

<li>
Then use "grep" to search the log for a specific object by grepping for
its memory address...</li>

<li>
On a typical *short*&nbsp;run of mozilla, I'll end up with a malloc-log
file of around 5 to 10 megabytes and the resulting converted log file will
be 10 to 20 times that so be prepared to have alot of disk space. It helps
a great deal to narrow down your problem space to reduce the log file size...</li>
</ol>
