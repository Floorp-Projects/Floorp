!      ==========================================================
!      NOTE: If you're looking here for things to customize, look
!      on the Preferences dialogs under the Options menu first.
!      Most things are customizable from there.  Things which are
!      settable via the Preferences dialog boxes are stored in
!      the ~/.netscape/preferences file, and not in X resources.
!      ==========================================================
!
! This file lists the default resources built in to @NAME@.
! You can use the stuff in this file for examples of how to customize
! @NAME@ for your environment; normally you will do this by
! copying the few lines you want to alter to your private resource
! database, which usually lives in a file called .Xdefaults in your home
! directory.
!
! Site administrators **may** want to make changes here and install this
! file as the global app-defaults file for the site.  To do this, one
! would copy this file to /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/@CLASS@, or on SunOS,
! /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/@CLASS@.  (But actually this directory
! could be anywhere; only the person who installed X knows for sure.)
!
! It is **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED** that you not install this file in the
! app-defaults directory unless you are really sure you know what you are
! doing.  There are a whole slew of version-skew problems associated with
! app-defaults files, which are best avoided by simply not using them.
! In particular, if the app-defaults file for a program is installed, and
! you get a new version of that program, you can't properly test out the
! new version without actually installing it, since it will pick up the
! resources for the previous version, and will quite likely malfunction.
!
! In short, app-defaults files are bad.  Don't use them.  This file is
! provided for informational purposes, and so that I don't get a lot of
! complaints from people who think they understand this stuff better than
! I do.

! Language localization:
*versionLocale: en

! SGI only: Here's how you turn on SGI's Motif hacks:
!@ONLYSGI@@CLASS@*sgiMode:		True

! SGI only: Use enhanced file selection UI in SGI Motif
@ONLYSGI@*useEnhancedFSB:		True

! SGI Only: Use base color scheme:
@ONLYSGI@@CLASS@*scheme:		Base
@ONLYSGI@@CLASS@*useSchemes:		Colors

! This resource enables some hacks to the File Selection Box
! which use a simpler layout algorithm than the standard Motif
! code. The directory and file listings are always maintained
! as equal size. We don't do this for SGI, as they have solved
! the problem. See *useEnhancedFSB above.
@NOTSGI@*nsMotifFSBHacks: True

! This resource enables the CDE mode of the File Selection Box.
! You must be running a CDE enhanced Motif library for this
! option to work. This resource will apply pathMode=1 to the
! File Selection Box. If you specify nsMotifFSBHacks and
! nsMotifFSBCdeMode, some of the keyboard and filter enhancements
! of nsMotifFSBHacks will also be applied, the layout hacks will not.
*nsMotifFSBCdeMode: False

! SCO Only: IXI Motif Form widget is broken, don't use it
@ONLYSCO@*useIxiAdds: NONE

! User-Settable Parameters
! ========================

! This is the directory where @NAME@ finds external files such as icons.
!
*appDir:			@LIBDIR@/@LOC_LANG@/netscape

! This resource is the same as the -visual command line option, which selects
! an X visual on which the windows should be created.  Legal options are:
! Best, meaning pick the best one w.r.t. image quality; Default, meaning
! use whatever the server says is the default visual; a visual class (like
! PseudoColor or TrueColor); or a decimal or hexadecimal digit, the ID of
! a particular visual (in case there is more than one visual of a particular
! class.)  "Best" is probably the right choice.
!
*visualID:			Best

! Whether @NAME@ should install a private colormap.  This will cause the
! maximal number of colors to be used, but on most systems, will result in
! unpleasant colormap flashing when switching between applications.  Legal
! options are: Yes, No, and Guess.  "Guess" means "install the colormap only
! if we know that the display hardware supports multiple simultaneous
! colormaps, meaning that there will be no colormap flashing."  Currently,
! that means install the map when displaying on an SGI screen, and don't
! otherwise.  (What other vendors have multiple hardware colormaps, and how
! do you uniquely identify that capability?  Let me know.)
!
*installColormap:		Guess

! Some motif versions have a XmDragOverShell (called "dragOver")
! widget which has a XmNinstallColormap resource.  Force it to false here
! so that there is no conflict with the "*installColormap: Guess" stuff.
*dragOver*installColormap:		False

! The maximum number of color cells to allocate per image; this is only
! relevant when using the default colormap of a PseudoColor visual.
! If it is 0, we allocate as many colors as we can get.  (The more colors
! that we can allocate, the better images will look.)  This controls only
! the number of colors allocated for internal images - a few more colors
! will be allocated for the fluff and chrome that comes with Motif.
!
*maxImageColors:		0

! Set this to false to disable the <BLINK> tag.
*blinkingEnabled:		True

! Whether the Exit menu item should confirm first.
*confirmExit:			False

! Mouse cursor when over an anchor.
*linkCursor:			hand2

! Mouse cursor when awaiting a reply.
*busyCursor:			watch

! Mouse cursor when "Save Next Link As..." mode is on, and over a link.
*saveNextLinkCursor:		hand2

! Mouse cursor when "Save Next Link As..." mode is on, and not over a link.
*saveNextNonlinkCursor:		crosshair

! How quickly (in seconds) the status messages should update.
*progressInterval:		1

! How quickly (in milliseconds) the run light and/or logo should animate.
*busyBlinkRate:			500

! How often (in seconds) the global history, bookmarks, and disk cache
! files should be updated.
*saveHistoryInterval:		600

! How many pixels of motion must occur before a mouse-release is interpreted
! as a "drag" rather than a "click."
*hysteresis:			3

! These resources control whether @NAME@ should redirect its stdout and
! stderr streams to a dialog box, so that diagnostics reported by other
! programs launched by @NAME@ (for example, external viewers specified in
! a mailcap file) will be reported to the user through a dialog box,
! instead of simply showing up on the stdout/stderr of the controlling
! terminal of @NAME@ (which in many cases won't even be visible.)
!
! If you have a external viewer which produces an annoying amount of output
! even when it has nothing interesting to say, you can shut it up by
! redirecting its output to stderr; for example, to do this to mpeg_play,
! you could add the following to your .mailcap file:
!
!        video/mpeg; mpeg_play %s 2>&-
!
! Normally, @NAME@ captures both the stdout and stderr into the dialog box.
! If you find a need to let one or both of them continue on to the actual
! terminal of @NAME@, you can do it by setting these resources to False.
!
*useStderrDialog:		True
*useStdoutDialog:		True

! For those MIME content-encodings which are not directly understood
! internally, it is possible to specify another Unix program to use as
! a filter here.
!
! Each line in the encodingFilters resource consists of four fields,
! separated by colons and optional whitespace:
!
!   <input-encoding>  : <output-encoding> : <extensions> : <filter-command>
!
! input-encoding:  The MIME encoding from the Content-Transfer-Encoding header.
!                  (The basic encodings 7BIT, 8BIT, BINARY, BASE64, and QUOTED-
!                  PRINTABLE are built-in; no need to specify those.)
!
! output-encoding: The encoding that results from this transformation.
!                  Leaving this empty is usually appropriate.
!
! extensions:      A comma-separated list of the extensions typically used for
!                  files in this encoding; if a document ends in one of these
!                  extensions, then when that document is saved to disk, the
!                  extension will be stripped off of the default file name
!                  (since documents are decoded before they are saved, and the
!                  extension would no longer accurately describe the file.)
!
! filter-command:  A shell command which reads from stdin and writes to stdout
!                  which does the actual decoding.
!

! Too many servers have bugs in the implementation of window gravity for
! us to rely on it.  Scrolling of large forms is *significantly* faster
! if we are able to make use of window gravity, but on many X servers, it
! results in form items being scattered randomly all over the document.
! Legal values for this resource are Yes, No, Partial, and Guess.  If
! "Guess", we run some tests and try to decide whether the X server is
! broken or partially broken.
!
! If you find yourself needing to use a value here other than Guess,
! please tell us, so that we can make it guess correctly in the future.
!
*windowGravityWorks:		Guess


! By default, the geometries of components (browsers, mail, address book, etc)
! are saved in ~/.netscape/preferences.js.  If this pisses you off, uncomment
! the following line and Mozilla will not remember component geometries.
!
! Equivalent to using the '-dont-save-geometry-prefs' startup flag.
!
!*dontSaveGeometryPrefs:		True


! Uncomment the following line to ignore any geometry preferences that
! might have been saved.
!
! Equivalent to using the '-ignore-geometry-prefs' startup flag.
!
!*ignoreGeometryPrefs:			True


! Uncomment the following line to bypass the startup licence page.
!
! Equivalent to using the '-no-about-splash' startup flag.
!
!*noAboutSplash:				True

! Mozilla supports session management by default.  Uncomment the following
! line to force it off.
!
! Equivalent to using the '-session-management'
!                         '-no-session-management' startup flags.
!
!*sessionManagement:			False


! Different platforms deal with session management in fundamentally
! different ways.  Toggle this resource if you experience session
! management problems.
!
! IRIX session management is on by default only on SGI systems.  It is also
! available on other platforms and might work with session managers other
! than the IRIX desktop.  To use session management as the IRIX desktop
! expects it, uncomment the following line.
!
! Equivalent to using the '-irix-session-management'
!                         '-no-irix-session-management' startup flags.
!
!*irixSessionManagement:			True


! Uncomment the following line to ignore the alwaysraised, alwayslowered,
! and z-lock JavaScript window.open() attributes.  By default,  Mozilla will
! try to force the window stacking to match these attributes.  If you think
! this is the ultimate fascism, uncomment the following line.
!
! Equivalent to using the '-dont-force-window-stacking' startup flag.
!
!*dontForceWindowStacking:		True


! Colors
!
! This resource controls the foreground text color of unfollowed links 
! (links which have not yet been visited.)
!
*linkForeground:			#0000FF

! This resource controls the foreground text color of followed links 
! (links which have already been visited.)
!
*vlinkForeground:			#990066

! This resource controls the foreground text color of activated links 
! (links which are in the process of being clicked upon.)
!
*alinkForeground:			#FF0000

! These resources control the foreground and background colors of text
! which has been selected with the mouse.
!
*selectForeground:			#000000
*selectBackground:			#FFFFCC

! These resources control the foreground and background colors of normal text.
!
*defaultForeground:			#000000
*defaultBackground:			#C0C0C0

! This resource may be used to specify a default background image.  It should
! be a file name or URL pointing to a GIF, JPEG, or XBM image.  If it is blank,
! then the default background color will be used instead.
!
*defaultBackgroundImage:		

! Normally, the user-specified colors and backgrounds will only be used when
! viewing documents which did not specify their own colors and backgrounds.
! If this resource is set to False, then the user-specified colors and
! backgrounds will always be used, regardless of the options specified in 
! the document itself.
!
*documentColorsHavePriority:		True


! Geometry
!
! Here's how you set the default sizes and positions of the @NAME@ windows:
!
! For the web browser window:   Netscape.Navigator.geometry: =500x700+100-0
! For the mail reader:          Netscape.Mail.geometry: =500x800+200-0
! For the news reader:          Netscape.News.geometry: =500x800+300-0
! For the mail editor:          Netscape.Composition.geometry: =400x600
! For the bookmarks window:     Netscape.Bookmarks.geometry: =300x900-0-0
! For the address book window:  Netscape.AddressBook.geometry: =600x900-300-0
! For the download windows:     Netscape.Download.geometry: =500x200-0-0
!
! In previous versions of @NAME@, we suggested setting the geometry on the
! TopLevelShell class; don't do that any more.  It will affect *all* of the
! top-level @NAME@ windows, including bookmarks and message composition and
! so on, which is probably not what you want.
!
! To set the sizes of the panes and columns in the mail and news windows, 
! change them to the layout you like, and then select "Options/Save Options".
! (To change the fonts in the message lists, search below for the resource
! that begins with "XmLGrid*fontList".)



! Translations
!
! Many of these translations are duplicated on both "Meta" and "Alt", since
! X has this stupid notion that "Meta" and "Alt" are not synonymous, and
! Sun in their infinite wisdom furthers this confusing lossage by both having
! Meta *and* Alt keys on the keyboard, and having the key which is labelled
! Alt generate *META* (the Diamond keys generate Alt.)  All praise Sun!
! All praise the X keyboard model!
!
! And because of the need to do this, we have to do all of the keyboard
! equivalents with "translations" instead of "accelerators", since a menu
! item can only have one accelerator, and in order to make both Meta and Alt
! work we need to give them each two.  All praise Motif!


! Keybindings in the main window which correspond to menu items.
! These are installed on every widget which is a child of our Shell,
! and are not installed on popups/transients.

! Some basic emacs-like bindings for text fields.
!
! "editingTranslations" are merged into all XmText and XmTextField widgets.
! Then, either "multiLinEditingTranslations" or "singleLinEditingTranslations"
! are merged in, depending on whether it is an XmText or XmTextField widget.
! These resources are merged in after "globalTranslations", so it is possible
! for them to override the menu accelerators.
!
! Problems:
!  = I don't understand why the "Ctrl<Key>g" binding does nothing.
!  = I wish things like `C-k C-k C-k C-n C-k C-k C-y' did the right thing.
!  = This doesn't quite do active regions right, in that C-SPC M-f doesn't
!    leave the word highlighted (though it does leave a region set.)
! Basically, XmText is not Emacs, and we therefore exist in a world of pain.
!
!  NOTE: if you're looking here because BackSpace and Delete aren't
!        working the way you think they should, then you need to run
!        xmodmap or xkeycaps to fix your keyboard, or mess read the man
!        page for VirtualBindings(1).  For details, see the @NAME@ FAQ
!        (available from the Help menu.)

! Translations that apply only to single-line fields; see above.
!
! Ctrl-U clears the current line only in single-line fields.  Unix
! command-line weenies expect this, even though everyone knows Ctrl-U
! should mean "prefix argument".
!
! In single-line fields, the various killing commands are really deletion
! commands instead (that is, they don't affect the Clipboard and are not
! undoable with Ctrl-y) because the XmTextField widget does not provide
! kill commands -- only the XmText widget does.  (What the hell is up with
! that...)  Maybe we could get around this by never using XmTextField, and
! only using XmText with editMode set to SINGLE_LINE_EDIT, but that might
! have other unexpected effects...
!
! I thought of making Meta-d be `set-anchor() forward-word() cut-clipboard()',
! but that doesn't work, because forward-word takes the whitespace after the
! word as well, instead of stopping before the whitespace.
!
! Similarly, Ctrl-k can't be implemented with
! `set-anchor() end-of-line(extend) cut-clipboard() delete-selection()'
! because that has the side effect of (temporarily) owning the selection,
! which would make it impossible to: select text in another application;
! type C-k at Mozilla; Click middle to paste.  The paste would be impossible
! because C-k would have cleared the selection.

! We merge these translations into all text fields which are not the

! About Translations, Actions, and "-remote" commands:
!
! You can control a running @NAME@ process externally; you do this by
! issuing a command like "@PROGNAME@ -remote openURL(http://xxx)".
! When @NAME@ is invoked with the -remote argument, it does not open
! window, but instead connects to and controls an already-existing process.
! This is done using X properties, so the two @NAME@ processes need not
! be running on the same machine, and need not share a file system.
!
! All of @NAME@'s action names are the same as its resource names; so, for
! example, if you wanted to know the name of the action that corresponds to
! the "Add Bookmark" menu item, you could look in this file for "Add Bookmark"
! and see that the resource that is set to that string is "addBookmark" -
! that's the name of the Action as well.
!
! You can use Actions in Translation tables in the usual Xt-ish way, but you
! can also invoke them directly via "@PROGNAME@ -remote", like this:
!
!    @PROGNAME@ -remote 'addBookmark()'
!
! That will cause the existing @NAME@ process to add its current URL to
! the bookmarks, just as if you had selected that menu item.
!
! Please see the document http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/x-remote.html
! for more information.

 \n\
Please set a new disk cache directory from the Advanced/Cache\n\
section of the`Edit|Preferences...' dialog.\n

*createdCacheDirMessage:	\
A directory has been created for use as the disk cache:\n\

section of the`Edit|Preferences...' dialog.\n

*cacheNotDirMessage:	\
Error: the directory configured for use as the disk cache\n\

 \n\
Please set a new disk cache directory using the Advanced/Cache\n\
section of the`Edit|Preferences...' dialog.\n

*cacheSuffixMessage:	\
 \n\
There should be one disk cache per user, so using a shared\n\
directory (such as /tmp) is not advised.\n\
 \n\
The maximum disk cache size is currently %d kilobytes.\n\
You can change the cache size in the Advanced/Cache\n\
section of the`Edit|Preferences...' dialog.\n\
 \n\
If you wish to disable disk caching, set the Disk Cache Size\n\
to 0.  If you do this, documents will continue to be cached\n\
in memory according to the Memory Cache Size preference,\n\
but will no longer be cached on disk.  This means that the\n\
cache will not last from session to session of @NAME@.

*cubeTooSmallMessage:		\
We were only able to allocate %d cells for the color\n\
cube to which images are dithered.  As a result, the\n\
image quality may be poor.\n\
 \n\
One way to improve image quality is to exit any other\n\
color-intensive applications which are running and\n\
restart @NAME@.\n\
 \n\
Another way is to run @NAME@ with the `-install' \n\
command-line option, which will cause it to use a\n\
private colormap.  The drawback to this is that on\n\
some systems, this will result in colormap flashing\n\
when moving focus to other windows.

*renameInitFilesMessage:		\
Preferences files from an older version of @NAME@ exist;\n\
This version of @NAME@ uses the same file formats, but the\n\
file names have changed.  Would you like us to rename these\n\
files now?

*unsentMailMessage:			\
 Unsent mail messages exist, do you really want to quit without sending them?

*binaryDocumentMessage:			\

! This is 72 rather than 79 or 80 because the width of the window controls
! when word wrapping should occur; the Motif text area has no mechanism for
! wrapping at a column other than the last one.  So, if we want a fill-column
! of N, the window must be N wide.  Note that wrapping must occur before 80:
! sending out lines with 80 characters on them is antisocial, as many programs
! and terminals (including emacs) can only display 79 characters without 
! wrapping.  Wrapping at 72 is better than wrapping at 79 because it leaves
! room for further followups to quote the lines with ">" without causing
! lines to wrap.
!
! Note that, in the composition window, lines beginning with ">" will not
! be wrapped at all, despite the appearance on the screen.  So just because
! it looks like the quoted text has been mangled, doesn't mean it has.

! Need class name in here to defeat *sgiMode and HP-VUE color nonsense...
! On SGIs, not having the class will cause the default SGI colors to
! be used instead of the ones specified here.  With VUE, the behavior
! is even worse - if we're using a non-default visual (for example, if
! we have requested a 24-bit TrueColor visual instead of the default
! 8-bit PseudoColor) then VUE will ignore the fact that we're not using
! the default visual, and give us colors allocated from the wrong
! colormap, resulting in lovely effects like brown-on-brown menubars!
!
