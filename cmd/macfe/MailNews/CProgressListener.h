	// - graphical status level showing a percent value (msg_NSCProgressPercentChanged)
	// - text message showing a percent value (msg_NSCProgressUpdate)
	// - general purpose text message (msg_NSCProgressMessageChanged)
	//
	// The first two messages (those about the percent value) are always filtered
	// in order to avoid flickers generated by frequent updates.
	//
	// The last one is not filtered by default: it allows for instance
	// to keep track of the mouse cursor over an HTML page and display as fast
	// as possible the URLs corresponding to the links pointed by the cursor.
	//
	// The first level of laziness (lazy_JustABit) filters frequent updates of
	// the text messages and allows to go much faster when loading a mail.
	//
	// The second level of laziness (lazy_VeryButForThisCommandOnly) filters
	// the normal text messages and completely ignores the text messages showing
	// a percent value. It allows to go much faster when downloading news articles.
	// This mode is automatically reset to the previous one when the command has completed.
