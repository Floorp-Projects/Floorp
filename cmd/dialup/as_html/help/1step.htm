<P><B>Connect to this ISP to Begin Account Creation</B></P>

<P>You're ready to connect to this ISP to create your Internet account.</P>

<p>If the ISP offers more than one account access phone number, choose the phone number your modem will dial each time you connect to your Internet account. Most ISP's offer local access phone numbers that let you connect without incurring long distance telephone charges. If you are unsure that the phone number you want to use is a local call, check with your phone company to find out if the provider's access number is a number you can use without incurring additional phone charges.</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose the phone number you want to use to connect to this ISP. Communicator will use this phone number every time you connect to your Internet account.</li>
<li>Click "Dial Modem to Connect to ISP."</li>
</ol>

<p>Account Setup calls the ISP so you can begin the account creation process. Account Setup sends the ISP the  information you previously entered in Account Setup for validation. When your new account is created, Communicator is automatically configured to use your new Internet account.</P>

<p>Your credit card will only be charged by the ISP if you go through the entire account creation process and then click the Create Account button when it appears.</p>

<p>At the end of the account creation process, you'll see a screen with some simple account information and a Finish Setup button. Click Finish Setup to automatically set up Communicator to use your new account. To begin using your new account, exit Account Setup and start Communicator.</p>
