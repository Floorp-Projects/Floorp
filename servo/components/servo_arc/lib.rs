//! Fork of Arc for Servo. This has the following advantages over std::sync::Arc:
//!
//! * We don't waste storage on the weak reference count.
//! * We don't do extra RMU operations to handle the possibility of weak references.
//! * We can experiment with arena allocation (todo).
//! * We can add methods to support our custom use cases [1].
//! * We have support for dynamically-sized types (see from_header_and_iter).
//! * We have support for thin arcs to unsized types (see ThinArc).
//! * We have support for references to static data, which don't do any
//!   refcounting.
//!
//! [1]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1360883

// The semantics of `Arc` are already documented in the Rust docs, so we don't
// duplicate those here.
