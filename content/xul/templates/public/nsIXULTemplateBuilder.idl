/**
 * A template builder, given an input source of data, a template, and a
 * reference point, generates a list of results from the input, and copies
 * part of the template for each result. Templates may generate content
 * recursively, using the same template, but with the previous iteration's
 * results as the reference point. As an example, for an XML datasource the
 * initial reference point would be a specific node in the DOM tree and a
 * template might generate a list of all child nodes. For the next iteration,
 * those children would be used to generate output for their child nodes and
 * so forth.
 *
 * A template builder is attached to a single DOM node; this node is called
 * the root node and is expected to contain a XUL template element as a direct
 * child. Different template builders may be specialized in the manner in
 * which they generate and display the resulting content from the template.
 *
 * The structure of a template is as follows:
 *
 * <rootnode datasources="" ref="">
 *   <template>
 *     <queryset>
 *       <query>
 *       </query>
 *       <rule>
 *         <conditions>...</conditions>
 *         <bindings>...</bindings>
 *         <action>...</action>
 *       </rule>
 *     </queryset>
 *   </template>
 * </rootnode>
 *
 * The datasources attribute on the root node is used to identify the source
 * of data to be used. The ref attribute is used to specify the reference
 * point for the query. Currently, the datasource will either be an
 * nsIRDFDataSource or a DOM node. In the future, other datasource types may
 * be used.
 *
 * The <queryset> element contains a single query and one or more <rule>
 * elements. There may be more than one <queryset> if multiple queries are
 * desired, and this element is optional if only one query is needed -- in
 * that case the <query> and <rule>s are allowed to be children of the
 * <template> node
 *
 * The contents of the query are processed by a separate component called a
 * query processor. This query processor is expected to use this query to
 * generate results when asked by the template builder. The template builder
 * then generates output for each result based on the <rule> elements.
 *
 * This allows the query processor to be specific to a particular kind of
 * input data or query syntax, while the template builder remains independent
 * of the kind of data being used. Due to this, the query processor will be
 * supplied with the datasource and query which the template builder handles
 * in an opaque way, while the query processor handles these more
 * specifically.
 *
 * Results implement the nsIXULTemplateResult interface and may be identified
 * by an id which must be unique within a given set of query results.
 *
 * Each query may be accompanied by one or more <rule> elements. These rules
 * are evaluated by the template builder for each result produced by the
 * query. A rule consists of conditions that cause a rule to be either
 * accepted or rejected. The condition syntax allows for common conditional
 * handling; additional filtering may be applied by adding a custom filter
 * to a rule with the builder's addRuleFilter method.
 *
 * If a result passes a rule's conditions, this is considered a match, and the
 * content within the rule's <action> body is inserted as a sibling of the
 * <template>, assuming the template builder creates real DOM content. Only
 * one rule will match a result. For a tree builder, for example, the content
 * within the action body is used to create the tree rows instead. A matching
 * result must have its ruleMatched method called. When a result no longer
 * matches, the result's hasBeenRemoved method must be called.
 *
 * Optionally, the rule may have a <bindings> section which may be used to
 * define additional variables to be used within an action body. Each of these
 * declared bindings must be supplied to the query processor via its
 * addBinding method. The bindings are evaluated after a rule has matched.
 *
 * Templates may generate content recursively, using the previous iteration's
 * results as reference point to invoke the same queries. Since the reference
 * point is different, different output will typically be generated.
 *
 * The reference point nsIXULTemplateResult object for the first iteration is
 * determined by calling the query processor's translateRef method using the
 * value of the root node's ref attribute. This object may be retrieved later
 * via the builder's rootResult property.
 *
 * For convenience, each reference point as well as all results implement the
 * nsIXULTemplateResult interface, allowing the result objects from each
 * iteration to be used directly as the reference points for the next
 * iteration.
 *
 * When using multiple queries, each may generate results with the same id.
 * More than one of these results may match one of the rules in their
 * respective queries, however only the result for the earliest matching query
 * in the template becomes the active match and generates output. The
 * addResult, removeResult, replaceResult and resultBindingChanged methods may
 * be called by the query processor to indicate that the set of valid results
 * has changed, such that a different query may match. If a different match
 * would become active, the content for the existing match is removed and the
 * content for the new match is generated. A query processor is not required
 * to provide any support for updating results after they have been generated.
 *
 * See http://wiki.mozilla.org/XUL:Templates_Plan for details about templates.
