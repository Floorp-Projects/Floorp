/**
 * Mozilla's XMLHttpRequest is modelled after Microsoft's IXMLHttpRequest
 * object. The goal has been to make Mozilla's version match Microsoft's
 * version as closely as possible, but there are bound to be some differences.
 *
 * In general, Microsoft's documentation for IXMLHttpRequest can be used.
 * Mozilla's interface definitions provide some additional documentation. The
 * web page to look at is http://www.mozilla.org/xmlextras/
 *
 * Mozilla's XMLHttpRequest object can be created in JavaScript like this:
 *   new XMLHttpRequest()
 * compare to Internet Explorer:
 *   new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP")
 *
 * From JavaScript, the methods and properties visible in the XMLHttpRequest
 * object are a combination of nsIXMLHttpRequest and nsIJSXMLHttpRequest;
 * there is no need to differentiate between those interfaces.
 *
 * From native code, the way to set up onload and onerror handlers is a bit
 * different. Here is a comment from Johnny Stenback <jst@netscape.com>:
 *
 *   The mozilla implementation of nsIXMLHttpRequest implements the interface
 *   nsIDOMEventTarget and that's how you're supported to add event listeners.
 *   Try something like this:
 *
 *   nsCOMPtr<nsIDOMEventTarget> target(do_QueryInterface(myxmlhttpreq));
 *
 *   target->AddEventListener(NS_LITERAL_STRING("load"), mylistener,
 *                            PR_FALSE)
 *
 *   where mylistener is your event listener object that implements the
 *   interface nsIDOMEventListener.
 *
 *   The 'onload', 'onerror', and 'onreadystatechange' attributes moved to
 *   nsIJSXMLHttpRequest, but if you're coding in C++ you should avoid using
 *   those.
 *
 * Conclusion: Do not use event listeners on XMLHttpRequest from C++, unless
 * you're aware of all the security implications.  And then think twice about
 * it.
