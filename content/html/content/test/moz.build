# This extra subdirectory is needed due to the nature of this test.
# With the bug, the test loads the base URL of the bug649134/file_*.sjs
# files, and the mochitest server responds with the contents of index.html if
# it exists in that case, which we use to detect failure.
# We can't have index.html in this directory because it would prevent
# running the tests here.
