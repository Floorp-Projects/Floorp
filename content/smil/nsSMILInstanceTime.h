// interval.
//
// For an overview of how this class is related to other SMIL time classes see
// the documentation in nsSMILTimeValue.h
//
// These objects are owned by an nsSMILTimedElement but MAY also be referenced
// by:
//
// a) nsSMILIntervals that belong to the same nsSMILTimedElement and which refer
//    to the nsSMILInstanceTimes which form the interval endpoints; and/or
// b) nsSMILIntervals that belong to other nsSMILTimedElements but which need to
//    update dependent instance times when they change or are deleted.
//    E.g. for begin='a.begin', 'a' needs to inform dependent
//    nsSMILInstanceTimes if its begin time changes. This notification is
//    performed by the nsSMILInterval.
