# High-Level APIs #

Modules in this section implement high-level APIs for
building add-ons:

* creating user interfaces
* interacting with the web
* interacting with the browser

These modules are "supported": meaning that they are relatively
stable, and that we'll avoid making incompatible changes to them
unless absolutely necessary.
