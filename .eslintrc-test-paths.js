// The `*testPaths` defined below for test paths are the main path formats we
// prefer to support for tests as they are commonly used across the tree.

// We prefer the tests to be in named directories as this makes it easier
// to identify the types of tests developers are working with. Additionally,
// it is not possible to scope ESLint rules to individual files based on .ini
// files without a build step that would break editors, or an expensive loading
// cycle.

// Please do not add more cases of multiple test types in a single
// directory. This may cause ESLint rules to be incorrectly applied to the wrong
// tests, leading to false negatives. It could cause the wrong sets of globals
// to be defined in the scope, causing false positives when checking for no
// undefined variables.

// See https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/code-quality/lint/linters/eslint.html#i-m-adding-tests-how-do-i-set-up-the-right-configuration
// for more information.
