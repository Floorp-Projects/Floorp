/**
 * Helper module around `sharedData` object that helps storing the state
 * of all observed Targets and Resources, that, for all DevTools connections.
 * Here is a few words about the C++ implementation of sharedData:
 * https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/bc3600def806859c31b2c7ac06e3d69271052a89/dom/ipc/SharedMap.h#30-55
 *
 * We may have more than one DevToolsServer and one server may have more than one
 * client. This module will be the single source of truth in the parent process,
 * in order to know which targets/resources are currently observed. It will also
 * be used to declare when something starts/stops being observed.
 *
 * `sharedData` is a platform API that helps sharing JS Objects across processes.
 * We use it in order to communicate to the content process which targets and resources
 * should be observed. Content processes read this data only once, as soon as they are created.
 * It isn't used beyond this point. Content processes are not going to update it.
 * We will notify about changes in observed targets and resources for already running
 * processes by some other means. (Via JS Window Actor queries "DevTools:(un)watch(Resources|Target)")
 * This means that only this module will update the "DevTools:watchedPerWatcher" value.
 * From the parent process, we should be going through this module to fetch the data,
 * while from the content process, we will read `sharedData` directly.
