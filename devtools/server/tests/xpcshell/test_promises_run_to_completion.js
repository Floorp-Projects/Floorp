// Bug 1145201:  Promise then-handlers can still be executed while the debugger is paused.
//
// When a promise is resolved, for each of its callbacks, a microtask is queued
// to run the callback. At various points, the HTML spec says the browser must
// "perform a microtask checkpoint", which means to draw microtasks from the
// queue and run them, until the queue is empty.
//
// The HTML spec is careful to perform a microtask checkpoint directly after
// each invocation of an event handler or DOM callback, so that code using
// promises can trust that its promise callbacks run promptly, in a
// deterministic order, without DOM events or other outside influences
// intervening.
//
// When the JavaScript debugger interrupts the execution of debuggee content
// code, it naturally must process events for its own user interface and promise
// callbacks. However, it must not run any debuggee microtasks. The debuggee has
// been interrupted in the midst of executing some other code, and the
// JavaScript spec promises developers: "Once execution of a Job is initiated,
// the Job always executes to completion. No other Job may be initiated until
// the currently running Job completes." [1] This promise would be broken if the
// debugger's own event processing ran debuggee microtasks during the
// interruption.
//
// Looking at things from the other side, a microtask checkpoint must be
// performed before returning from a debugger callback, rather than being put
// off until the debuggee performs its next microtask checkpoint, so that
// debugger microtasks are not interleaved with debuggee microtasks. A debuggee
// microtask could hit a breakpoint or otherwise re-enter the debugger, which
// might be quite surprised to see a new debugger callback begin before its
// previous promise callbacks could finish.
//
