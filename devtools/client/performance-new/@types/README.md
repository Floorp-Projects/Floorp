# TypeScript @types

This folder contains the type files that can be imported into various files. These types are collected here, and are likely cumbersome to type in JSDoc, or are separate enough from the code that it's easier to type them in separate files (such as the Redux store types).

In addition, there is an ambient type file, `gecko.d.ts` file that contains the ambient types that are unique to Gecko.
