# Animation inspector is migrating to React

This folder contains the code for the current animation inspector. It is currently being rewritten in React in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1399830.

The new version of the animation inspector can be found in devtools/inspector/animation.

The preference to switch between the old and the new animation inspector is:

  devtools.new-animationinspector.enabled

(the default value for this preference depends on the current channel)
