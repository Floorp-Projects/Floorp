# LOCALIZATION NOTE (fontinspector.fontInstanceLabel): This label is shown next to the UI
# in the font editor which allows a user to select a font instance option from a
# dropdown. An instance is like a preset. A "font instance" is the term used by the font
# authors to mean a group of predefined font settings.
fontinspector.fontInstanceLabel=Instance
