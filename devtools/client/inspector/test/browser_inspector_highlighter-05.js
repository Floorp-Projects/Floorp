// This is testing that the Anonymous Content is properly inserted into the document.
// Usually that is happening during the "interactive" state of the document, to have them
// ready as soon as possible.
// However, in some conditions, that's not possible since we don't have access yet to
// the `CustomContentContainer`, that is used to add the Anonymous Content.
// That can happen if the page has some external resource, as <link>, that takes time
// to load and / or returns the wrong content. This is not happening, for instance, with
// images.
//
// In those case, we want to be sure that if we're not able to insert the Anonymous
// Content at the "interactive" state, we're doing so when the document is loaded.
