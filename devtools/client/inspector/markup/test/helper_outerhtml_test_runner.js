 * Run a series of edit-outer-html tests.

 * inserted in place of the current one for that node.
 * This test runner will wait for the mutation event to be fired and will check
 * a few things. Each test may also provide its own validate function to perform
 * assertions and verify that the new outer html is correct.
 * @param {Array} tests See runEditOuterHTMLTest for the structure
 * @param {InspectorPanel} inspector The instance of InspectorPanel currently
 * opened
 * @return a promise that resolves when the tests have run
