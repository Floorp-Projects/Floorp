## MDN Compatibility Data
The Compatibility panel detects issues by comparing against official [MDN compatibility data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data). It uses a local snapshot of the dataset. This dataset needs to be manually synchronized periodically to `devtools/shared/compatibility/dataset` (ideally with every Firefox release).

To update this dataset, please refer to the guidelines in `devtools/shared/compatibility/README.md`

## Tests
* Client: `devtools/client/inspector/compatibility/test`
* MDN compatibility library: `devtools/server/actors/compatibility/lib/test`
* Server: `devtools/server/tests/browser/browser_compatibility_cssIssues.js`
