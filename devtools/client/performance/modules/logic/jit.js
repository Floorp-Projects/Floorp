/**
 * Model representing JIT optimization sites from the profiler
 * for a frame (represented by a FrameNode). Requires optimization data from
 * a profile, which is an array of RawOptimizationSites.
 *
 * When the ThreadNode for the profile iterates over the samples' frames, each
 * frame's optimizations are accumulated in their respective FrameNodes. Each
 * FrameNode may contain many different optimization sites. One sample may
 * pick up optimization X on line Y in the frame, with the next sample
 * containing optimization Z on line W in the same frame, as each frame is
 * only function.
 *
 * An OptimizationSite contains a record of how many times the
 * RawOptimizationSite was sampled, as well as the unique id based off of the
 * original profiler array, and the RawOptimizationSite itself as a reference.
 * @see devtools/client/performance/modules/logic/tree-model.js
 *
 * @struct RawOptimizationSite
 * A structure describing a location in a script that was attempted to be optimized.
 * Contains all the IonTypes observed, and the sequence of OptimizationAttempts that
 * were attempted, and the line and column in the script. This is retrieved from the
 * profiler after a recording, and our base data structure. Should always be referenced,
 * and unmodified.
 *
 * Note that propertyName is an index into a string table, which needs to be
 * provided in order for the raw optimization site to be inflated.
 *
 * @type {Array<IonType>} types
 * @type {Array<OptimizationAttempt>} attempts
 * @type {?number} propertyName
 * @type {number} line
 * @type {number} column
 *
 *
 * @struct IonType
 * IonMonkey attempts to classify each value in an optimization site by some type.
 * Based off of the observed types for a value (like a variable that could be a
 * string or an instance of an object), it determines what kind of type it should be
 * classified as. Each IonType here contains an array of all ObservedTypes under `types`,
 * the Ion type that IonMonkey decided this value should be (Int32, Object, etc.) as
 * `mirType`, and the component of this optimization type that this value refers to --
 * like a "getter" optimization, `a[b]`, has site `a` (the "Receiver") and `b`
 * (the "Index").
 *
 * Generally the more ObservedTypes, the more deoptimized this OptimizationSite is.
 * There could be no ObservedTypes, in which case `typeset` is undefined.
 *
 * @type {?Array<ObservedType>} typeset
 * @type {string} site
 * @type {string} mirType
 *
 *
 * @struct ObservedType
 * When IonMonkey attempts to determine what type a value is, it checks on each sample.
 * The ObservedType can be thought of in more of JavaScripty-terms, rather than C++.
 * The `keyedBy` property is a high level description of the type, like "primitive",
 * "constructor", "function", "singleton", "alloc-site" (that one is a bit more weird).
 * If the `keyedBy` type is a function or constructor, the ObservedType should have a
 * `name` property, referring to the function or constructor name from the JS source.
 * If IonMonkey can determine the origin of this type (like where the constructor is
 * defined), the ObservedType will also have `location` and `line` properties, but
 * `location` can sometimes be non-URL strings like "self-hosted" or a memory location
 * like "102ca7880", or no location at all, and maybe `line` is 0 or undefined.
 *
 * @type {string} keyedBy
 * @type {?string} name
 * @type {?string} location
 * @type {?string} line
 *
 *
 * @struct OptimizationAttempt
 * Each RawOptimizationSite contains an array of OptimizationAttempts. Generally,
 * IonMonkey goes through a series of strategies for each kind of optimization, starting
 * from most-niche and optimized, to the less-optimized, but more general strategies --
 * for example, a getter opt may first try to optimize for the scenario of a getter on an
 * `arguments` object -- that will fail most of the time, as most objects are not
 * arguments objects, but it will attempt several strategies in order until it finds a
 * strategy that works, or fails. Even in the best scenarios, some attempts will fail
 * (like the arguments getter example), which is OK, as long as some attempt succeeds
 * (with the earlier attempts preferred, as those are more optimized). In an
 * OptimizationAttempt structure, we store just the `strategy` name and `outcome` name,
 * both from enums in js/public/TrackedOptimizationInfo.h as TRACKED_STRATEGY_LIST and
 * TRACKED_OUTCOME_LIST, respectively. An array of successful outcome strings are above
 * in SUCCESSFUL_OUTCOMES.
 *
 * @see js/public/TrackedOptimizationInfo.h
 *
 * @type {string} strategy
 * @type {string} outcome
