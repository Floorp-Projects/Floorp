/**
 * Bug 979536: Ensure fronts are destroyed after toolbox close.
 *
 * The fronts need to be destroyed manually to unbind their onPacket handlers.
 *
 * When you initialize a front and call |this.manage|, it adds a client actor
 * pool that the DevToolsClient uses to route packet replies to that actor.
 *
 * Most (all?) tools create a new front when they are opened.  When the destroy
 * step is skipped and the tool is reopened, a second front is created and also
 * added to the client actor pool.  When a packet reply is received, is ends up
 * being routed to the first (now unwanted) front that is still in the client
 * actor pool.  Since this is not the same front that was used to make the
 * request, an error occurs.
 *
 * This problem does not occur with the toolbox for a local tab because the
 * toolbox target creates its own DevToolsClient for the local tab, and the
 * client is destroyed when the toolbox is closed, which removes the client
 * actor pools, and avoids this issue.
 *
 * In remote debugging, we do not destroy the DevToolsClient on toolbox close
 * because it can still used for other targets.
 * Thus, the same client gets reused across multiple toolboxes,
 * which leads to the tools failing if they don't destroy their fronts.
