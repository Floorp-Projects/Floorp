// The only purpose of this module is to load the real aboutdebugging module via the
// BrowserLoader.
// This cannot be done using an inline script tag in index.html because we are applying
// CSP for about: pages in Bug 1492063.
// And this module cannot be merged with aboutdebugging.js because modules loaded with
// script tags are using Promises bound to the lifecycle of the document, while modules
// loaded with a devtools loader use Promises that will still resolve if the document is
// destroyed. This is particularly useful to ensure asynchronous destroy() calls succeed.
