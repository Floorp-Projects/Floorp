# Source Maps

This package contains DevTools utilities for working with source maps.
The toolbox inside Firefox loads this package and passes it down to interested tools so
that they can share a common instance of the utilities

# Application Requirements

This package assumes that an application using this code will make the
`worker.js`, and `dwarf_to_json.wasm` files available and call
`startSourceMapWorker(workerURL, wasmRoot)` to initialize the worker and specify
the location of the wasm asset.
