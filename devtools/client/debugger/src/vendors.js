 * Vendors.js is a file used to bundle and expose all dependencies needed to run
 * the transpiled debugger modules when running in Firefox.
 *
 * To make transpilation easier, a vendored module should always be imported in
 * same way:
 * - always with destructuring (import { a } from "modA";)
 * - always without destructuring (import modB from "modB")
 *
 * Both are fine, but cannot be mixed for the same module.

// We cannot directly export literals containing special characters
// (eg. "my-module/Test") which is why they are nested in "vendored".
// The keys of the vendored object should match the module names
// !!! Should remain synchronized with .babel/transform-mc.js !!!
