 * Retrieve the list of column breakpoints to be displayed.
 * This ignores lines without any breakpoint, but also lines with a single possible breakpoint.
 * So that we only return breakpoints where there is at least two possible breakpoint on a given line.
 * Also, this only consider lines currently visible in CodeMirror editor.
 *
 * This method returns an array whose elements are objects having two attributes:
 *  - breakpoint: A breakpoint object refering to a precise column location
 *  - location: The location object in an active source where the breakpoint location matched.
 *              This location may be the generated or original source based on the currently selected source type.
 *
 * See `visibleColumnBreakpoints()` for the definition of arguments.
