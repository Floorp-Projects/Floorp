/**
 * A middleware which acts like a service, because it is stateful
 * and "long-running" in the background. It provides the ability
 * for actions to install a function to be run once when a specific
 * condition is met by an action coming through the system. Think of
 * it as a thunk that blocks until the condition is met. Example:
 *
 * ```js
 * const services = { WAIT_UNTIL: require('wait-service').NAME };
 *
 * { type: services.WAIT_UNTIL,
 *   predicate: action => action.type === "ADD_ITEM",
 *   run: (dispatch, getState, action) => {
 *     // Do anything here. You only need to accept the arguments
 *     // if you need them. `action` is the action that satisfied
 *     // the predicate.
 *   }
 * }
 * ```

    // dispatch again and run this service (that use case is
