Throttling
==========

The network monitor allows you to throttle your network speed to emulate various connection speeds so you can see how your app will behave under different connection types.

Throttling
**********

The toolbar includes a Throttling dropdown, which allows you to throttle your network speed to emulate various different network speed conditions. Choose an option from the menu, and it will persist across reloads.

The characteristics emulated are:

- Download speed
- Upload speed
- Minimum latency

The table below lists the numbers associated with each network type, but please do not rely on this feature for exact performance measurements; it's intended to give an approximate idea of the user experience in different conditions. The speeds are expressed in multiples of bits per second.
