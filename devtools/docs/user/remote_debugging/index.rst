Remote Debugging
================

You can use the :doc:`Firefox developer tools <../index>` on your desktop to debug Web sites and Web apps running in other browsers or runtimes. The other browser might be on the same device as the tools themselves or on a different device, such as a phone connected over USB.

The detailed instructions for connecting the developer tools are specific to the runtime.

You can connect the developer tools to Gecko-based runtimes like Firefox Desktop, Firefox for Android, and Thunderbird.
