Page Inspector
==============

Use the Page Inspector to examine and modify the HTML and CSS of a page.

You can examine pages loaded in the local copy of Firefox or in a remote target such as Firefox for Android. See :doc:`remote debugging <../remote_debugging/index>` to learn how to connect the developer tools to a remote target.


User Interface Tour
*******************

To find your way around the Inspector, here's a :doc:`quick tour of the UI <ui_tour/index>`.

You can split the Rules view out into its own pane, separate from the other tabs on the CSS pane â€” this is called :doc:`3-pane mode <3-pane_mode/index>`.
