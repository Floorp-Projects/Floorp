=======================================
Animation inspector (Firefox 41 and 42)
=======================================

.. note::
  Note that the Animation inspector's UI was revamped in Firefox 43. To see what the Animation inspector looks like in Firefox 43 and subsequent releases, see :ref:`the main "Work with animations" page <page-inspector-how-to-work-with-animations-animation-inspector>`.


The Animation inspector enables you to:


- see information about all animations running in the page
- play/pause all animations
- play/pause/rewind/fast-forward each animation
- jump to a specific point in an animation
- highlight and inspect the animated node
- adjust the playback rate of each animation
- see whether an animation is running in the compositor thread (a lightning bolt icon is displayed next to such animations)
