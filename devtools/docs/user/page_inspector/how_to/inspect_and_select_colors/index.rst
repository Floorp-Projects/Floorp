Inspect and select colors
=========================

In the CSS Pane's :ref:`Rules view <page_inspector_ui_tour_rules_view>`, if a rule contains a color value, you'll see a sample of the color next to the value:

.. image:: inspector-css-color-swatch.png

A color sample is also shown for CSS custom properties (variables) that represent colors.

If you click on the color sample, you'll see a color picker popup, enabling you to change the color:

.. image:: color-picker-good-contrast.png
  :alt: Color picker showing a case of good contrast with the background

.. image:: color-picker-bad-contrast.png
  :alt: Color picker showing a case of poor contrast" src="color-picker-bad-contrast.png

If the color is a foreground color, the color picker tells you whether its contrast with the background color meets accessibility guidelines. Hovering the mouse over the contrast message gives a more detailed explanation.

The color picker includes an eyedropper icon: clicking this icon enables you to use the eyedropper to select a new color for the element from the page:

.. raw:: html
