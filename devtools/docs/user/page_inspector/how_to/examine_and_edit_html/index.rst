=====================
Examine and edit HTML
=====================

You can examine and edit the page's HTML in the :ref:`HTML pane <page_inspector_ui_tour_html_pane>`.


Navigating the HTML
*******************

.. _page-inspector-how-to-examine-and-edit-html-breadcrumbs:

HTML breadcrumbs
----------------

At the bottom on the HTML pane is a breadcrumbs toolbar. This shows the complete hierarchy through the document for the branch containing the selected element:

.. image:: html_breadcrumbs.png
  :class: border


Hovering over a breadcrumb highlights that element in the page.

The breadcrumbs bar has its own :ref:`keyboard shortcuts <keyboard-shortcuts-breadcrumbs-bar>`.


.. _page_inspector_how_to_examine_and_edit_html_searching:

Searching
---------

The Page Inspector's search box matches all markup in the current document and in any frames.

To start searching the markup, click in the search box to expand it or press :kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`F` , or :kbd:`Cmd` + :kbd:`F` on a Mac. There are three types of searches that are performed automatically depending on what you enter, a full text search, a CSS selector search, and an XPath search.


Full text search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The full text search will always be executed, independently of what you enter. That allows you to find CSS selectors and XPath expressions occurring within the text.


CSS selector search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can search elements by entering a `CSS selector <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS_Selector>`_

As you type, an autocomplete popup shows any class or ID attributes that match the current search term:

.. image:: search_html.png
  :class: border


Press :kbd:`Up` and :kbd:`Down` to cycle through suggestions, :kbd:`Tab` to choose the current suggestion, then :kbd:`Enter` to select the first node with that attribute.


To cycle through matches, press :kbd:`Enter`. You can cycle backwards through matches using :kbd:`Shift` + :kbd:`Enter`.


XPath search
~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is also possible to search via `XPaths <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath>`_. This allows you to search for specific elements without the conflict of matching words within the text. For example, ``//a`` matches all `a <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a>`_ elements but not the letter "a" within the text content. Furthermore it allows for some more advanced searches like finding elements that start with a specific text, for example.

.. image:: xpath_search.png
  :alt: Match of an Inspector search using an XPath expression
  :class: border


HTML tree
---------

The rest of the pane shows you the page's HTML as a tree (this UI is also called the Markup View). Just to the left of each node is an arrow: click the arrow to expand the node. If you hold the Alt key while clicking the arrow, it expands the node and all the nodes underneath it.

.. image:: html_tree.png
  :alt: The new Firefox 57 inspector HTML tree.
  :class: center


Moving the mouse over a node in the tree highlights that element in the page.

Nodes that are not visible are shown faded/desaturated. This can happen for different reasons such as using `display: none <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display>`_ or that the element doesn't have any dimensions.

.. |image1| image:: child-node-indicator.png
  :width: 20

There is an ellipsis shown between the opening and closing tag of an element when the node is collapsed if it has larger contents. Now children are indicated in the tree with this icon: |image1|


Markers ("badges") are displayed to the right of some nodes. The table below explains the meaning of each badge:

.. |br| raw:: html

    <br/>


.. list-table::
  :widths: 25 75
  :header-rows: 0

  * - ``event``
    - The element has one or several event listeners attached to it. Clicking the marker opens a tooltip listing the event listeners and allows you for each listener to switch to the line of JavaScript code in the :doc:`Debugger <../../../debugger/index>` where the listener is defined.

  * - ``scroll``
    - The element is a `scroll container <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scroll_container>`_, i.e. it has either ``overflow: scroll`` applied, or ``overflow: auto`` and sufficient content to cause `scrollable overflow <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Overflow>`_. |br| |br| If preference ``devtools.overflow.debugging.enabled`` is ``true``, toggling the ``scroll`` badge will highlight any elements causing the overflow, and these nodes will additionally display the ``overflow`` badge.

  * - ``overflow``
    - The element is causing `scrollable overflow <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Overflow>`_ in a `scroll container <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scroll_container>`_ (either the current node or a parent node—the affected nodewill display the ``scroll`` badge). |br| |br| **Note**: The ``overflow`` badge is introduced in Firefox 83. In earlier versions it can be enabled using the preference ``devtools.overflow.debugging.enabled`` is ``true``.

  * - ``grid``
    - The element is a `grid container <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Grid_Container>`_, i.e. it has `display: grid <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display>`_ applied to it. Clicking the marker enables the grid highlighter.

  * - ``flex``
    - The element is a `flex container <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Flex_Container>`_, i.e. it has `display: flex <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display>`_ applied to it. Clicking the marker enables the flexbox highlighter.

  * - ``inline-grid``
    - The element is an inline grid container, i.e. it has `display: inline-grid <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display>`_ or ``display: inline grid`` applied to it. Clicking the marker enables the grid highlighter.

  * - ``inline-flex``
    - The element is an inline flex container, i.e. it has `display: inline-flex <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display>`_ or ``display: inline flex`` applied to it. Clicking the marker enables the flexbox highlighter.

  * - ``custom…``
    - The element is a custom element. Clicking the marker switches to the line of JavaScript code in the Debugger where the custom element got defined.



.. note::
  There are some useful keyboard shortcuts that can be used in the HTML tree — see the :ref:`HTML pane keyboard shortcuts list <keyboard-shortcuts-html-pane>`.


::before and ::after
--------------------

You can inspect pseudo-elements added using `::before <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before>`_ and `::after <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::after>`_

.. raw:: html

  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ecfqTGvzsNc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <br/>
  <br/>


Custom element definition
-------------------------

When you open the Inspector on a page that includes custom elements, you can view the class definition for the custom element in the Debugger:


1. Inspect the element
2. Click on the word ``custom``


.. image:: custom_pc_01.png
  :class: center


The source for the element's class will be displayed in the Debugger.

.. image:: custom_pc_02.png
  :class: center


Whitespace-only text nodes
--------------------------

Web developers don’t write all their code in just one line of text. They use white space such as spaces, returns, or tabs between their HTML elements because it makes markup more readable.

Usually this white space seems to have no effect and no visual output, but in fact, when a browser parses HTML it will automatically generate anonymous text nodes for elements not contained in a node. This includes white space (which is after all a type of text).

If these auto generated text nodes are `inline level <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Visual_formatting_model#inline-level_elements_and_inline_boxes>`_, browsers will give them a non-zero width and height. Then you will find strange gaps between elements, even if you haven’t set any margin or padding on them.

.. |image2| image:: new-whitespace-text-indicator.png
  :width: 20

Since Firefox 52, the Inspector displays these whitespace nodes, so you can see where the gaps in your markup come from. Whitespace nodes are represented with a dot: |image2| and you get an explanatory tooltip when you hover over them:

.. image:: white_space_only.png
  :class: center


To see this in action, see the demo at https://mdn.github.io/devtools-examples/whitespace-only-demo/index.html.


Shadow roots
------------

Any shadow roots present in the DOM are exposed in the HTML page in the same manner as the regular DOM. The shadow root is signified by a node named ``#shadow-root`` — you can click its expansion arrow to see the full contents of the shadow DOM, and then manipulate the contained nodes in a similar way to other part of the page's DOM (although with a limited featureset — you can't, for example, drag and drop or delete shadow DOM nodes).


.. image:: inspector_shadowdom.png
  :alt: A view of a shadow root shown inside the DOM tree in the Firefox DevTools
  :class: center


If a shadow DOM contains a "slotted" element (an element with a ``slot`` attribute after it has been inserted inside a `slot <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot>`_ element — see `Adding flexibility with slots <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_templates_and_slots#adding_flexibility_with_slots>`_ for an explanation of how these are used), the "slotted" element will be shown inside its corresponding `slot <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot>`_ element, with a "reveal" link alongside it. Clicking the "reveal" link will highlight the element with the ``slot`` attribute as it exists outside the shadow DOM

.. image:: inspector_slot.png
  :alt: A view of a shadow root shown inside the DOM tree in the Firefox DevTools
  :class: center


This is very useful when you've got a ``<slot>`` element and you can't find the source of its content.


.. note::

  Shadow DOM inspection was implemented in Firefox 61, but was hidden behind the ``dom.webcomponents.shadowdom.enabled`` pref until Firefox 63. It is now turned on by default.

.. _page-inspector-how-to-examine-and-edit-html-editing_html:

Editing HTML
************

You can edit the HTML — tags, attributes, and content — directly in the HTML pane: double-click the text you want to edit, change it, and press Enter to see the changes reflected immediately.

To edit an element's `outerHTML <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/outerHTML>`_, activate the element's popup menu and select "Edit As HTML". You'll see a text box in the HTML pane:

.. image:: edit_html.png
  :alt: Edit HTML directly in the Inspector panel in Firefox 57
  :class: border

You can add any HTML in here: changing the element's tag, changing existing elements, or adding new ones. Once you click outside the box, the changes are applied to the page.

When you're editing HTML, the context menu you'll see is the normal one for working with editable text:

.. image:: editable-context-menu.png
  :class: center


Copy and paste
--------------

You can use the :ref:`popup menu <page-inspector-how-to-element-popup-context-menu>` to copy nodes in the HTML tree and paste them into the desired location.


Drag and drop
-------------

You can reorganize the HTML content of a page by moving nodes in the HTML tree. Just click and hold on any element and drag it up or down in the tree. When you release the mouse button, the element will be inserted at the corresponding position:

.. raw:: html

  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oI-a035nfWk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <br/>
  <br/>

You can cancel the drag and drop by pressing the :kbd:`Esc` key.


.. _page-inspector-how-to-examine-and-edit-html-inserting-new-nodes:

Inserting new nodes
-------------------

There's a "+" icon at the top of the markup view:

.. image:: html_tree.png
  :class: border


Click this icon to insert an empty {{HTMLElement("div")}} into the document as the last child of the currently selected element. You can then edit the new node's content and styling just as you would any other node in the document.

.. raw:: html

  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NG5daffvVZM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <br/>
  <br/>

You can access the same functionality using the "Create New Node" popup menu item.

Note that this button is disabled if the selected element's type is such that adding a last-child would have no effect (for example, if it is an `html <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html>`_ or `iframe <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe>`_ element). However, it is enabled in places where it is not valid to insert a `div <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div>`_, such as `style <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style>`_ or `link <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link>`_. In these cases the element is added as text.
