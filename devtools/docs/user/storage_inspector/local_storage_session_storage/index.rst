Local Storage / Session Storage
===============================

When an origin corresponding to local storage or session storage is selected within the :doc:`Storage Inspector <../index>`, the names and values of all the items corresponding to local storage or session storage will be listed in a table.

You can edit local and session storage items by double-clicking inside cells in the :ref:`Table Widget <storage-inspector-table-widget>` and editing the values they contain:
