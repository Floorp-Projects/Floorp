Firefox DevTools User Docs
==========================

Firefox Developer Tools is a set of web developer tools built into Firefox. You can use them to examine, edit, and debug HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This section contains detailed guides to all of the tools as well as information on how to debug Firefox for Android, how to extend DevTools, and how to debug the browser as a whole.

If you have any feedback on DevTools or want to contribute to the project, you can `join the DevTools community <https://firefox-dev.tools/>`_.

.. note::

  If you are just getting started with web development and using developer tools, our `learning <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn>`_ docs will help you — see `Getting started with the Web <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web>`_ and `What are browser developer tools? <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools>`_ for good starting points.


The Core Tools
**************

You can open the Firefox Developer Tools from the menu by selecting **Tools > Web Developer > Web Developer Tools** or use the keyboard shortcut :kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`Shift` + :kbd:`I` or :kbd:`F12` on Windows and Linux, or :kbd:`Cmd` + :kbd:`Opt` + :kbd:`I` on macOS.

The ellipsis menu on the right-hand side of Developer Tools contains several commands that let you perform actions or change tool settings.

Connecting the Developer Tools
******************************

If you open the developer tools using :ref:`keyboard shortcuts <keyboard-shortcuts-opening-and-closing-tools>` or the equivalent menu items, they'll target the document hosted by the currently active tab. But you can attach the tools to a variety of other targets, too, both within the current browser and in different browsers or even different devices.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 0

   * - :doc:`about:debugging <about_colon_debugging/index>`
     - Debug add-ons, content tabs, and workers running in the browser.

   * - :ref:`Connecting to Firefox for Android <about-color-debugging-connecting-over-the-network>`
     - Connect the developer tools to an instance of Firefox running on an Android device.

   * - :doc:`Connecting to iframes <working_with_iframes/index>`
     - Connect the developer tools to a specific iframe in the current page.


Debugging the browser
*********************

By default, the developer tools are attached to a web page or web app. But you can also connect them to the browser as a whole. This is useful for browser and add-on development.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 0

   * - :doc:`Browser Console <browser_console/index>`
     - See messages logged by the browser itself and by add-ons, and run JavaScript code in the browser's scope.

   * - :doc:`Browser Toolbox <browser_toolbox/index>`
     - Attach the Developer Tools to the browser itself.



Extending DevTools
******************

For information on extending the Firefox DevTools, see `Extending the developer tools <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Extending_the_developer_tools>`_ over in the `Browser Extensions <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions>`_ section of MDN.


Migrating from Firebug
**********************

Firebug has come to the end of its lifespan (see `Firebug lives on in Firefox DevTools <Attach the Developer Tools to the browser itself.>`_ for details of why), and we appreciate that some people will find migrating to another less familiar set of DevTools to be challenging. To ease a transition from Firebug to the Firefox developer tools, we have written a handy guide — `Migrating from Firebug <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Migrating_from_Firebug>`_
