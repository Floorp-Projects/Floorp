The Application panel is available on the standard DevTools tab menu under *Application*, in Firefox 79+. If you canâ€™t see it there, you can enable it by going to the "three dot" menu and selecting *Settings* (also accessible by pressing F1), then checking the *Application* checkbox under *Default Developer Tools*.
