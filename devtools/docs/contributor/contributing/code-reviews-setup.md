# Set up for code reviews

There are two things you need to do before you can get a code review, although you only need to do this once 😃

## Set up to get code reviews in Phabricator

We use an online tool called Phabricator for code reviews. To create an account in Phabricator, you first need the Bugzilla account that you created earlier. If you don't have one, [create it now](../getting-started/bugzilla.md).

⚠️ *IMPORTANT:*  ⚠️️️

It's helpful to have the same user name in both Bugzilla and Phabricator, so that people always know how to find you.

Bugzilla's `Real name` field can be edited after the fact, but you cannot change Phabricator's username once the account has been created.

If you added an `:ircnickname` in your Bugzilla's `Real name`, Phabricator will use that to pre-fill the username field when you create the account. **Please double check you like the proposed username, and make any corrections before you register**.

Once you understand the above, please [create a Phabricator account](https://moz-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/phabricator-user.html#creating-an-account).



## Set up to send code for review

In order to push your commit to Phabricator, you need to install [moz-phab](https://moz-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/phabricator-user.html#using-moz-phab).
