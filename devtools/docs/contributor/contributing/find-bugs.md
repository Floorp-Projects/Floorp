# Find bugs to work on

* Choose something from [the list of existing bugs](https://codetribute.mozilla.org/projects/devtools). You can filter by tools (e.g. only `Console` bugs), and also by good bugs for beginners.
* Or if you would like to work on something that is not listed there, [file a bug in Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=DevTools) (you'll need the Bugzilla account [you created earlier](../getting-started/bugzilla.md)) and ask for it to be assigned to you. Please also try to initiate a conversation in the bug first, to ensure that you don't work on something that will not be accepted (for example, if you think you found a bug, but the feature worked that way by design).

<!-- TODO: mention finding potential work that is captured as a TODO or FIXME comments, but doesn't have an associated filed bug -->
