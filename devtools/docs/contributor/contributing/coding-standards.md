# Coding standards

Our code base is quite large, and a lot of different people contribute to it all the time. Therefore, it's important to share standards to keep the code consistent and written in a predictable style. This also helps avoid common mistakes.

We have pages defining standards, best practices and tips for various languages used in our tools:

* [JavaScript](./javascript.md)
* [CSS](./css.md)
* [SVG](../frontend/svgs.md)
