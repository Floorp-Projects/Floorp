# Debugger API

The Debugger API is a low-level API that provides methods for introspecting and affecting a target environment like a page. You can find JavaScript sources, set breakpoints on them, and more.

This API is completely documented on the [Debugger API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger-API) MDN page.
