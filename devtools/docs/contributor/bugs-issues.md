# Bugs and issue trackers

Since we have code in two different places, issues and bugs are to be found in two different places:

* For code in `m-c`: [http://firefox-dev.tools/](http://firefox-dev.tools/) which also lets you filter by good bugs for beginners.
* For code in `devtools-html`: [this page](https://github.com/search?l=&q=org%3Adevtools-html+state%3Aopen&type=Issues) lists all the issues across the organisation and these are [available issues](https://github.com/search?l=&q=org%3Adevtools-html+state%3Aopen+label%3Aavailable&type=Issues) i.e. ready to be worked on.
