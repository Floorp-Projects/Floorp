**Hello,** and thanks for your interest in contributing to Firefox DevTools! 

DevTools is a complex web app, but if you're familiar with either HTML/CSS or JavaScript, you can create a patch!

The initial setup process of building Firefox can take a while. If you get stuck at any point, you can ask for help on the [DevTools Slack](https://devtools-html-slack.herokuapp.com/). 

We all make lots of errors when we get started, so don't worry about that—there are safeguards in place to ensure that any commits that land in the Firefox repository are peer-reviewed, can be built, and pass the tests in multiple configurations and operating systems.

(Note: You can navigate these docs with the arrow keys.)
