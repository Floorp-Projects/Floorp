/**
 * This helper function (and its companion object) are used by bulk senders and
 * receivers to read and write data in and out of other streams.  Functions that
 * make use of this tool are passed to callers when it is time to read or write
 * bulk data.  It is highly recommended to use these copier functions instead of
 * the stream directly because the copier enforces the agreed upon length.
 * Since bulk mode reuses an existing stream, the sender and receiver must write
 * and read exactly the agreed upon amount of data, or else the entire transport
 * will be left in a invalid state.  Additionally, other methods of stream
 * copying (such as NetUtil.asyncCopy) close the streams involved, which would
 * terminate the debugging transport, and so it is avoided here.
 *
 * Overall, this *works*, but clearly the optimal solution would be able to just
 * use the streams directly.  If it were possible to fully implement
 * nsIInputStream / nsIOutputStream in JS, wrapper streams could be created to
 * enforce the length and avoid closing, and consumers could use familiar stream
 * utilities like NetUtil.asyncCopy.
 *
 * The function takes two async streams and copies a precise number of bytes
 * from one to the other.  Copying begins immediately, but may complete at some
 * future time depending on data size.  Use the returned promise to know when
 * it's complete.
 *
 * @param input nsIAsyncInputStream
 *        The stream to copy from.
 * @param output nsIAsyncOutputStream
 *        The stream to copy to.
 * @param length Integer
 *        The amount of data that needs to be copied.
 * @return Promise
 *         The promise is resolved when copying completes or rejected if any
 *         (unexpected) errors occur.
