/**
 * Emit SOURCE resources, which represents a Javascript source and has the following attributes set on "available":
 *
 * - introductionType {null|String}: A string indicating how this source code was introduced into the system.
 *   This will typically be set to "scriptElement", "eval", ...
 *   But this may have many other values:
 *     https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/ac142717cc067d875e83e4b1316f004f6e063a46/dom/script/ScriptLoader.cpp#2628-2639

 * - sourceMapBaseURL {String}: Base URL where to look for a source map.
 *   This isn't the source map URL.
 * - sourceMapURL {null|String}: URL of the source map, if there is one.
 * - url {null|String}: URL of the source, if it relates to a particular URL.
 *   Evaled sources won't have any related URL.
 * - isBlackBoxed {Boolean}: Specifying whether the source actor's 'black-boxed' flag is set.
 * - extensionName {null|String}: If the source comes from an add-on, the add-on name.
