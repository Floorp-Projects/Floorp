### These strings are used inside the Debugger which is available from the Web
### Developer sub-menu -> 'Debugger', as well as in the "Paused Debugger
### Overlay" that is displayed in the content page when it pauses.

### The correct localization of this file might be to keep it in

### A good criteria is the language in which you'd find the best
