// A Port is essentially a node in a circular list of addresses. For the sake of
// this documentation such a list will henceforth be referred to as a "route."
// Routes are the fundamental medium upon which all Node event circulation takes
// place and are thus the backbone of all Mojo message passing.
//
// Each Port is identified by a 128-bit address within a Node (see node.h). A
// Port doesn't really *do* anything per se: it's a named collection of state,
// and its owning Node manages all event production, transmission, routing, and
// processing logic. See Node for more details on how Ports may be used to
// transmit arbitrary user messages as well as other Ports.
//
// Ports may be in any of a handful of states (see State below) which dictate
// how they react to system events targeting them. In the simplest and most
// common case, Ports are initially created as an entangled pair (i.e. a simple
// cycle consisting of two Ports) both in the |kReceiving| State. Consider Ports
// we'll label |A| and |B| here, which may be created using
// Node::CreatePortPair():
//
//     +-----+          +-----+
//     |     |--------->|     |
//     |  A  |          |  B  |
//     |     |<---------|     |
//     +-----+          +-----+
//
// |A| references |B| via |peer_node_name| and |peer_port_name|, while |B| in
// turn references |A|. Note that a Node is NEVER aware of who is sending events
// to a given Port; it is only aware of where it must route events FROM a given
// Port.
//
// For the sake of documentation, we refer to one receiving port in a route as
// the "conjugate" of the other. A receiving port's conjugate is also its peer
// upon initial creation, but because of proxying this may not be the case at a
// later time.
//
// ALL access to this data structure must be guarded by |lock_| acquisition,
// which is only possible using a PortLocker. PortLocker ensures that
// overlapping Port lock acquisitions on a single thread are always acquired in
// a globally consistent order.

    // a dead-end -- in which case the route is broken -- or it reaches the
