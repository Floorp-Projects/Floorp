// The basis for all native run loops on the Mac is the CFRunLoop.  It can be
// used directly, it can be used as the driving force behind the similar
// Foundation NSRunLoop, and it can be used to implement higher-level event
// loops such as the NSApplication event loop.
//
// This file introduces a basic CFRunLoop-based implementation of the
// MessagePump interface called CFRunLoopBase.  CFRunLoopBase contains all
// of the machinery necessary to dispatch events to a delegate, but does not
// implement the specific run loop.  Concrete subclasses must provide their
// own DoRun and Quit implementations.
//
// A concrete subclass that just runs a CFRunLoop loop is provided in
// MessagePumpCFRunLoop.  For an NSRunLoop, the similar MessagePumpNSRunLoop
// is provided.
//
// For the application's event loop, an implementation based on AppKit's
// NSApplication event system is provided in MessagePumpNSApplication.
//
// Typically, MessagePumpNSApplication only makes sense on a Cocoa
// application's main thread.  If a CFRunLoop-based message pump is needed on
// any other thread, one of the other concrete subclasses is preferrable.
// MessagePumpMac::Create is defined, which returns a new NSApplication-based
// or NSRunLoop-based MessagePump subclass depending on which thread it is
// called on.
