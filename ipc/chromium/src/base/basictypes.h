// The arraysize(arr) macro returns the # of elements in an array arr.
// The expression is a compile-time constant, and therefore can be

// a pointer by mistake, you will get a compile-time error.
//
// One caveat is that arraysize() doesn't accept any array of an
// anonymous type or a type defined inside a function.  In these rare
// cases, you have to use the unsafe ARRAYSIZE_UNSAFE() macro below.  This is
// due to a limitation in C++'s template system.  The limitation might
// eventually be removed, but it hasn't happened yet.

// This template function declaration is used in defining arraysize.
// Note that the function doesn't need an implementation, as we only
// use its type.

// ARRAYSIZE_UNSAFE performs essentially the same calculation as arraysize,
// but can be used on anonymous types or types defined inside
// functions.  It's less safe than arraysize as it accepts some
// (although not all) pointers.  Therefore, you should use arraysize
// whenever possible.
//
// The expression ARRAYSIZE_UNSAFE(a) is a compile-time constant of type
// size_t.
//
// ARRAYSIZE_UNSAFE catches a few type errors.  If you see a compiler error
//
//   "warning: division by zero in ..."
//
// when using ARRAYSIZE_UNSAFE, you are (wrongfully) giving it a pointer.
// You should only use ARRAYSIZE_UNSAFE on statically allocated arrays.
//
// The following comments are on the implementation details, and can
// be ignored by the users.
//
// ARRAYSIZE_UNSAFE(arr) works by inspecting sizeof(arr) (the # of bytes in
// the array) and sizeof(*(arr)) (the # of bytes in one array
// element).  If the former is divisible by the latter, perhaps arr is
// indeed an array, in which case the division result is the # of
// elements in the array.  Otherwise, arr cannot possibly be an array,
// and we generate a compiler error to prevent the code from
// compiling.
//
// Since the size of bool is implementation-defined, we need to cast
// !(sizeof(a) & sizeof(*(a))) to size_t in order to ensure the final
// result has type size_t.
//
// This macro is not perfect as it wrongfully accepts certain
// pointers, namely where the pointer size is divisible by the pointee
// size.  Since all our code has to go through a 32-bit compiler,
// where a pointer is 4 bytes, this means all pointers to a type whose
// size is 3 or greater than 4 will be (righteously) rejected.

#define ARRAYSIZE_UNSAFE(a)     \
  ((sizeof(a) / sizeof(*(a))) / \
   static_cast<size_t>(!(sizeof(a) % sizeof(*(a)))))

// Use implicit_cast as a safe version of static_cast or const_cast
// for upcasting in the type hierarchy (i.e. casting a pointer to Foo
// to a pointer to SuperclassOfFoo or casting a pointer to Foo to
// a const pointer to Foo).
// When you use implicit_cast, the compiler checks that the cast is safe.
// Such explicit implicit_casts are necessary in surprisingly many
// situations where C++ demands an exact type match instead of an
// argument type convertable to a target type.
//
// The From type can be inferred, so the preferred syntax for using
// implicit_cast is the same as for static_cast etc.:
//
//   implicit_cast<ToType>(expr)
//
// implicit_cast would have been part of the C++ standard library,
// but the proposal was submitted too late.  It will probably make
// its way into the language in the future.

//                  content_type_names_incorrect_size);

//
//   COMPILE_ASSERT(sizeof(foo) < 128, foo_too_large);

// Implementation details of COMPILE_ASSERT:
//
// - COMPILE_ASSERT works by defining an array type that has -1
//   elements (and thus is invalid) when the expression is false.
//
// - The simpler definition
//
//     #define COMPILE_ASSERT(expr, msg) typedef char msg[(expr) ? 1 : -1]
//
//   does not work, as gcc supports variable-length arrays whose sizes
//   are determined at run-time (this is gcc's extension and not part
//   of the C++ standard).  As a result, gcc fails to reject the
//   following code with the simple definition:
//
//     int foo;
//     COMPILE_ASSERT(foo, msg); // not supposed to compile as foo is
//                               // not a compile-time constant.
//
// - By using the type CompileAssert<(bool(expr))>, we ensures that
//   expr is a compile-time constant.  (Template arguments must be
//   determined at compile-time.)
//
// - The outter parentheses in CompileAssert<(bool(expr))> are necessary
//   to work around a bug in gcc 3.4.4 and 4.0.1.  If we had written
//
//     CompileAssert<bool(expr)>
//
//   instead, these compilers will refuse to compile
//
//     COMPILE_ASSERT(5 > 0, some_message);
//
//   (They seem to think the ">" in "5 > 0" marks the end of the
//   template argument list.)
//
// - The array size is (bool(expr) ? 1 : -1), instead of simply
//
//     ((expr) ? 1 : -1).
//
//   This is to avoid running into a bug in MS VC 7.1, which
//   causes ((0.0) ? 1 : -1) to incorrectly evaluate to 1.
