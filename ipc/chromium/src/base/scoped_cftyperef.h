// CFTypeRef.  Style deviations here are solely for compatibility with
// scoped_ptr<>'s interface, with which everyone is already familiar.
//
// When scoped_cftyperef<> takes ownership of an object (in the constructor or
// in reset()), it takes over the caller's existing ownership claim.  The
// caller must own the object it gives to scoped_cftyperef<>, and relinquishes
// an ownership claim to that object.  scoped_cftyperef<> does not call
// CFRetain().
