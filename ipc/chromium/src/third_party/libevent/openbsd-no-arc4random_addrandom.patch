Bug 931354: OpenBSD doesn't provide arc4random_addrandom anymore, fix libevent accordingly by #ifndef'ing out its caller evutil_secure_rng_add_bytes() (which isnt called anywhere) r=joshaas

     You should almost never need to call this function; it should be
     sufficient to invoke evutil_secure_rng_init(), or let Libevent take
     care of calling evutil_secure_rng_init() on its own.
 
     If you call this function as a _replacement_ for the regular
     entropy sources, then you need to be sure that your input
     contains a fairly large amount of strong entropy.  Doing so is
     notoriously hard: most people who try get it wrong.  Watch out!
