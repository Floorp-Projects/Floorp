                      Getting Mozilla

==============================================================

You can download nightly builds of Mozilla from the Mozilla.org FTP site at

  ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/nightly/

For the very latest builds, see

  ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/nightly/latest

Keep in mind that nightly builds, which are used by Mozilla.org developers for testing, may be buggy. If you are looking for a more polished version of Mozilla, Mozilla.org releases Milestone builds of Mozilla every six weeks or so that you can download from

  http://www.mozilla.org/releases
 
Be sure to read the Mozilla release notes for information on known problems and installation issues with Mozilla.  The release notes can be found at the preceding URL along with the milestone releases themselves.

Note: Please use Talkback builds whenever possible. These builds allow transmission of crash data back to Mozilla developers, improved crash analysis, and posting of crash information to our crash-data newsgroup.

                 Installation Instructions

==============================================================

For Mac OS and Windows users, it is strongly recommended that you exit all programs before running the setup program. Also, you should temporarily disable virus-detection software.

For Linux users, note that the installation instructions use the bash shell. If you're not using bash, adjust the commands accordingly.

For all platforms, install into a clean (new) directory.  Installing on top of previously released builds may cause problems.

Note: These instructions do not tell you how to build Mozilla.  For info on building the Mozilla source, see

  http://www.mozilla.org/source.html


Windows Installation Instructions
---------------------------------

Note: For Windows NT/2000/XP systems, you need Administrator privileges to install Mozilla. If you see an "Error 5" message during installation, make sure you're running the installation with Administrator privileges.


To install Mozilla by downloading the Mozilla installer, follow these steps:
	
1. Click the the mozilla-win32-installer.exe link on the site you're downloading Mozilla from to download the installer file to your machine.
	
2. Navigate to where you downloaded the file and double-click the Mozilla program icon on your machine to begin the Setup program.
	
3. Follow the on-screen instructions in the setup program. The program starts automatically the first time.


To install Mozilla by downloading the .zip file and installing manually, follow these steps:

1. Click the mozilla-win32-talkback.zip link or the mozilla-win32.zip link on the site you're down- loading Mozilla from to download the .zip file to your machine.

2. Navigate to where you downloaded the file and double-click the compressed file.

Note: This step assumes you already have a recent version of WinZip installed, and that you know how to use it. If not, you can get WinZip and information about the program at www.winzip.com.

3. Extract the .zip file to a directory such as C:\Program Files\mozilla.org\Mozilla.

4. To start Mozilla, navigate to the directory you extracted Mozilla to and double-click the Mozilla.exe icon.

	
Mac OS Installation Instructions
--------------------------------

Note: If the downloaded file does not expand automatically you must expand the file using a program such as StuffIt Expander. Expander ships with all new Macs and comes with the default system install, so you may want to do a find in Sherlock for "StuffIt" to make sure that you don't already have it installed.

If you don't have Expander, you can get a copy at the following Web site:

  http://www.aladdinsys.com/expander/expander_mac_login.html

If you do already have Expander, you need to set it to start by default. See the above URL for info on using Expander.


To install Mozilla by downloading the Mozilla installer, (recommended) follow these steps:

1. Click the MacMozillaInstaller.sea.bin link on the site you're downloading Mozilla from to download the file to your Mac's desktop. A MozillaInstaller folder is created.
	
2. Double-click the MozillaInstaller folder in the Finder.

3. Double-click the Mozilla Installer icon.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.

5. To start Mozilla, open the folder where you installed Mozilla and double-click the Mozilla icon.


To install Mozilla by downloading the .bin file and installing manually, follow these steps:

1. Click the mozilla-mac-*.sea.bin link on the site you're downloading Mozilla from to download the Mozilla binary to your Mac's desktop.

2. Double-click the mozilla-mac-*.sea.sit.bin icon on your desktop.

3. Choose the directory where you want to install Mozilla.

4. To start Mozilla, open the folder where you installed Mozilla and double-click the Mozilla icon.


Linux Installation Instructions
-------------------------------

Note: If you install in the default directory (which is usually /usr/local/mozilla), or any other directory where only the root user normally has write-access, you must start Mozilla first as root before other users can start the program. Doing so generates a set of files required for later use by other users.


To install Mozilla by downloading the Mozilla installer, follow these steps:

1. Create a directory named mozilla (mkdir mozilla) and change to that directory (cd mozilla).
	
2. Click the link on the site you're downloading Mozilla from to download the installer file (called mozilla-1686-pc-linux-gnu-installer.tar.gz) to your machine.

3. Change to the mozilla directory (cd mozilla) and decompress the archive with the following command:

  tar zxvf moz*.tar.gz

The installer is now located in a subdirectory of Mozilla named mozilla-installer.

4. Change to the mozilla-installer directory (cd mozilla-installer) and run the installer with the ./mozilla-installer command.

5. Follow the instructions in the install wizard for installing Mozilla.

Note: If you have a slower machine, be aware that the installation may take some time. In this case, the installation progress may appear to hang indefinitely, even though the installation is still in process.

6. To start Mozilla, change to the directory where you installed it and run the ./mozilla command.


To install Mozilla by downloading the tar.gz file:

1. Create a directory named "mozilla" (mkdir mozilla) and change to that directory (cd mozilla).

2. Click the link on the site you're downloading Mozilla from to download the non-installer (mozilla*.tar.gz) file into the mozilla directory.

3. Change to the mozilla directory (cd mozilla) and decompress the file with the following command:

  tar zxvf moz*.tar.gz
	
This creates a "mozilla" directory under your mozilla directory. 

4. Change to the mozilla directory (cd mozilla). 

5. Run Mozilla with the following run script: 

  ./mozilla


To hook up Mozilla complete with icon to the GNOME Panel, follow these steps:

1. Click the GNOME Main Menu button, open the Panel menu, and then open the Add to Panel submenu and choose Launcher.

2. Right-click the icon for Mozilla on the Panel and enter the following command:
  directory_name./mozilla

where directory_name is the name of the directory you downloaded mozilla to. For example, the default directory that Mozilla suggests is /usr/local/mozilla.

3. Type in a name for the icon, and type in a comment if you wish.

4. Click the icon button and type in the following as the icon's location:

  directory_name/icons/mozicon50.xpm

where directory name is the directory where you installed Mozilla. For example, the default directory is /usr/local/mozilla/icons/mozicon50.xpm.
