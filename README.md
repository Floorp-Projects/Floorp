## How to Start Development

1. Run `deno install --allow-scripts`

You can run `deno task build` and `deno task dev`. `deno task build` outputs
files, while `deno task dev` is used for debugging the code with file watch.
Refer to "How to Debug" for instructions on using `deno task dev`.

## How to debug

### Windows

1. Install `gh cli` from [https://cli.github.com/]
2. Visit
   [noraneko-runtime Action](https://github.com/nyanrus/noraneko-runtime/actions/workflows/wrapper_windows_build.yml).
3. Go to latest successful build and check the id in url. It is run_id and is
   number. the `Release` version is recommended.
4. Run
   `gh run download -R nyanrus/noraneko-runtime -n noraneko-win-amd64-dev [run_id]`
5. Run `deno task dev`.
6. The browser will launch, and if you change some files, you could rerun
   `deno task dev`. If the source you changed supports HMR, it will reload the
   browser so you'll not need to rerun.

### GNU/Linux

1. Install `gh cli` from [https://cli.github.com/] and `lbzip2` from your
   package manager.
2. Visit
   [noraneko-runtime Action](https://github.com/nyanrus/noraneko-runtime/actions/workflows/wrapper_linux_build.yml).
3. Go to latest successful build and check the id in url. It is run_id and is
   number.
4. Run
   `gh run download -R nyanrus/noraneko-runtime -n noraneko-linux-amd64-dev [run_id]`
5. Run `mkdir -p _dist/bin`
6. Run `tar --strip-components=1 -xvf ./noraneko-*.tar.bz2 -C _dist/bin`
7. Run `deno task dev`
8. The browser will launch, and if you change some files, you could rerun
   `deno task dev`. If the source you changed supports HMR, it will reload the
   browser so you'll not need to rerun.
