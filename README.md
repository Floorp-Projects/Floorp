### 🧰 How to Start Development

Floorp's dev workflow is orchestrated by `feles-build` (a Deno task).

Prerequisites:

- Deno (2.x recommended)
- Node.js + pnpm may be required for some sub-projects (e.g. installers)

#### Windows

1. Install `deno` from [https://deno.land/](https://deno.land/)
2. Install PowerShell 7 (recommended: [Winget](https://winget.run/pkg/Microsoft/PowerShell))
3. Clone this repository.
4. Run `deno task feles-build dev` in the root directory.
5. A browser will launch, and if you change some files, Floorp/Noraneko will hot reload.
   If the source you changed supports HMR, it will reload the browser so you'll not need to rerun.

Notes:

- The first run may download runtime artifacts and take a while.

#### GNU/Linux

1. Install `deno` from [https://deno.land/](https://deno.land/)
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `deno task feles-build dev` in the root directory.
4. A browser will launch, and if you change some files, Floorp/Noraneko will hot reload.
   If the source you changed supports HMR, it will reload the browser so you'll not need to rerun.

#### macOS

1. Install `deno` from [https://deno.land/](https://deno.land/)
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `deno task feles-build dev` in the root directory.
4. A browser will launch, and if you change some files, Floorp/Noraneko will hot reload.
   If the source you changed supports HMR, it will reload the browser so you'll not need to rerun.

#### Other useful commands

- `deno task feles-build stage` (build production assets, run browser in dev mode)
- `deno task feles-build build --phase before-mach` (production assets step)
- `deno task feles-build build --phase after-mach` (post-build injection step)
