/*
** The thread that waits on a condition is blocked in a "waiting on
** condition" state until another thread notifies the condition or a
** caller specified amount of time expires. The lock associated with
** the condition variable will be released, which must have be held
** prior to the call to wait.
**
** Logically a notified thread is moved from the "waiting on condition"
** state and made "ready." When scheduled, it will attempt to reacquire
** the lock that it held when wait was called.
**
** The timeout has two well known values, PR_INTERVAL_NO_TIMEOUT and
** PR_INTERVAL_NO_WAIT. The former value requires that a condition be
** notified (or the thread interrupted) before it will resume from the
** wait. If the timeout has a value of PR_INTERVAL_NO_WAIT, the effect
** is to release the lock, possibly causing a rescheduling within the
** runtime, then immediately attempting to reacquire the lock and resume.
**
** Any other value for timeout will cause the thread to be rescheduled
** either due to explicit notification or an expired interval. The latter
** must be determined by treating time as one part of the monitored data
** being protected by the lock and tested explicitly for an expired
** interval.
**
** Returns PR_FAILURE if the caller has not locked the lock associated
** with the condition variable or the thread was interrupted (PR_Interrupt()).
** The particular reason can be extracted with PR_GetError().

** The calling thead must hold the lock that protects the condition, as
** well as the invariants that are tightly bound to the condition, when
