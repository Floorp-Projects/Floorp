Flash blocking for Camino is implemented using the FlashBlock extension
from http://flashblock.mozdev.org/.  FlashBlock is available under the
MPL/GPL/LGPL tri-license.  The files necessary for operation in Camino
are placed in the content directory and referenced by the jar.mn
manifest.  A contents.rdf file is included to allow Camino to identify
the contents of flashblock.jar.

Camino's bundled FlashBlock extension is currently synchronized with
FlashBlock 1.5.2 from
http://downloads.mozdev.org/flashblock/flashblock-1.5.2.xpi.
