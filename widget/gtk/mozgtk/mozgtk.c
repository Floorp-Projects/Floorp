// Bug 1271100
// We need to trick system Cairo into not using the XShm extension due to
// a race condition in it that results in frequent BadAccess errors. Cairo
// relies upon XShmQueryExtension to initially detect if XShm is available.
// So we define our own stub that always indicates XShm not being present.
// mozgtk loads before libXext/libcairo and so this stub will take priority.
// Our tree usage goes through xcb and remains unaffected by this.
//
// This is also used to force libxul to depend on the mozgtk library. If we
// ever can remove this workaround for system Cairo, we'll need something
// to replace it for that purpose.
MOZ_EXPORT Bool XShmQueryExtension(Display* aDisplay) { return False; }
