 * For export, call vaExportSurfaceHandle() with mem_type set to
 * VA_SURFACE_ATTRIB_MEM_TYPE_DRM_PRIME_2 and pass a pointer to an
 * instance of this structure to fill.
 * If VA_EXPORT_SURFACE_SEPARATE_LAYERS is specified on export, each
 * layer will contain exactly one plane.  For example, an NV12
 * surface will be exported as two layers, one of DRM_FORMAT_R8 and
 * one of DRM_FORMAT_GR88.
 * If VA_EXPORT_SURFACE_COMPOSED_LAYERS is specified on export,
 * there will be exactly one layer.
 *
 * For import, call vaCreateSurfaces() with the MemoryType attribute
 * set to VA_SURFACE_ATTRIB_MEM_TYPE_DRM_PRIME_2 and the
 * ExternalBufferDescriptor attribute set to point to an array of
 * num_surfaces instances of this structure.
 * The number of planes which need to be provided for a given layer
 * is dependent on both the format and the format modifier used for
 * the objects containing it.  For example, the format DRM_FORMAT_RGBA
 * normally requires one plane, but with the format modifier
 * I915_FORMAT_MOD_Y_TILED_CCS it requires two planes - the first
 * being the main data plane and the second containing the color
 * control surface.
 * Note that a given driver may only support a subset of possible
 * representations of a particular format.  For example, it may only
 * support NV12 surfaces when they are contained within a single DRM
 * object, and therefore fail to create such surfaces if the two
 * planes are in different DRM objects.
