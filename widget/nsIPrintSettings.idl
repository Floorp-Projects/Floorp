   * Duplex printing options.
   *
   * Note that other libraries refer to equivalent duplex settings using
   * various sets of terminology. This can be confusing and inconsistent both
   * with other libraries, and with the behavior that these terms intend to describe.
   *
   * kDuplexNone is equivalent to Simplex. Thankfully, both of these terms are
   * consistent with the behavior that they describe, which is to have single-sided
   * printing per sheet.
   *
   * kDuplexFlipOnLongEdge is equivalent to the following platform-specific constants:
   *   CUPS/macOS: NoTumble
   *      Windows: DMDUP_VERTICAL
   *          GTK: GTK_PRINT_DUPLEX_HORIZONTAL
   *
   * kDuplexFlipOnShortEdge is equivalent to the following platform-specific constants:
   *   CUPS/macOS: Tumble
   *      Windows: DMDUP_HORIZONTAL
   *          GTK: GTK_PRINT_DUPLEX_VERTICAL
   *
   *
   * Notice that the GTK and Windows constants have opposite meanings for
   * VERTICAL and HORIZONTAL.
   *
   * To make matters more confusing, these platform-specific terms describe different
   * behavior (from the user's perspective) depending on whether the sheet is in
   * portrait vs. landscape orientation.
   *
   * For example, the generic term "tumble" describes behavior where a sheet flips over
   * a binding on the top edge (like a calendar). This requires that the back side of
   * the sheet is printed upside down with respect to the front side of the sheet,
   * so that its content appears upright to the reader when they tumble-flip the
   * sheet over the top-edge binding.
   *
   * However, the CUPS/macOS Tumble setting only inverts the back side of the
   * sheet in portrait orientation. When you switch to landscape orientation, the
   * Tumble setting behaves like a book-like sheet flip, where the front and back
   * sides of the sheet are both printed upright with respect to each other.
   *
   * This is why it is more consistent and more clear to think of these terms
   * with regard to sheets being bound on the long edge or the short edge.
   *
   * kDuplexFlipOnLongEdge  + Portrait  =     book-like flip (front/back same direction)
   * kDuplexFlipOnLongEdge  + Landscape = calendar-like flip (front/back inverted)
   *
   * kDuplexFlipOnShortEdge + Portrait  = calendar-like flip (front/back inverted)
   * kDuplexFlipOnShortEdge + Landscape =     book-like flip (front/back same direction)
   *
   * The long-edge and short-edge terminology unfortunately breaks down when printing
   * with square sheet dimensions. Thankfully this edge case (hah) is quite uncommon,
   * since most standard printing paper dimensions are not square. Such a paper size
   * would even break the uniformly used portrait and landscape terminology.
