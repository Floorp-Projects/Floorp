/**
 * SwipeTracker turns PanGestureInput events into swipe events
 * (WidgetSimpleGestureEvent) and dispatches them into Gecko.
 * The swiping behavior mirrors the behavior of the Cocoa API
 * -[NSEvent
 *     trackSwipeEventWithOptions:dampenAmountThresholdMin:max:usingHandler:].
 * The advantage of using this class over the Cocoa API is that this class
 * properly supports submitting queued up events to it, and that it hopefully
 * doesn't intermittently break scrolling the way the Cocoa API does (bug
 * 927702).
 *
 * The swipe direction is either left or right. It is determined before the
 * SwipeTracker is created and stays fixed during the swipe.
 * During the swipe, the swipe has a current "value" which is between 0 and the
 * target value. The target value is either 1 (swiping left) or -1 (swiping
 * right) - see SwipeSuccessTargetValue().
 * A swipe can either succeed or fail. If it succeeds, the swipe animation
 * animates towards the success target value; if it fails, it animates back to
 * a value of 0. A swipe can only succeed if the user is swiping in an allowed
 * direction. (Since both the allowed directions and the swipe direction are
 * known at swipe start time, it's clear from the beginning whether a swipe is
 * doomed to fail. In that case, the purpose of the SwipeTracker is to simulate
 * a bounce-back animation.)
