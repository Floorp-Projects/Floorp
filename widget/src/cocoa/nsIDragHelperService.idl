/**
 * The nsIDragHelperService is a service that wraps the dispatch
 * of drag events into gecko with the appropriate management of
 * the nsDragService/nsDragSession. It frees the application from
 * having to manage details specific to how Gecko processes drag
 * and drop.
 *
 * If the browser takes up the entire window, this is straightforward:
 * call |enter| when the mouse enters the window, |tracking| while the
 * mouse moves/hovers inside the window, and |leave| when the mouse
 * exits the window. Call |drop| when the mouse is released w/in the window.
 *
 * If the browser does not take up the entire window, call |enter|
 * when the mouse enters the rectangle bounding the browser, |tracking|
 * while it is inside, |leave| when the mouse leaves the rectangle, and
 * |drop| when the mouse is released w/in the rectangle. Note that the
 * application is responsible for knowing where in its window the browser
 * has been placed.
