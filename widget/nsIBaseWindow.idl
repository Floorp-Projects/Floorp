		window as a native reference rather than relying on the calling
		application to have created the parent window as an nsIWidget.  This 
		value will be ignored (should be nsnull) if an nsIWidget is passed in to
		the parentWidget parameter.

	@param parentWidget - This allows a system to pass in the parenting widget.
		This allows some objects to optimize themselves and rely on the view
		system for event flow rather than creating numerous native windows.  If
		one of these is not available, nsnull should be passed.

	@param x - This is the x co-ordinate relative to the parent to place the
		window.
