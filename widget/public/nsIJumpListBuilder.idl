   * JumpLists
   *
   * Jump lists are built and then applied. Modifying an applied jump list is not
   * permitted. Callers should begin the creation of a new jump list using
   * initListBuild, add sub lists using addListToBuild, then commit the jump list
   * using commitListBuild. Lists are built in real-time during the sequence of
   * build calls, make sure to check for errors on each individual step.
   *
   * The default number of allowed items in a jump list is ten. Users can change
   * the number through system preferences. User may also pin items to jump lists,
   * which take up additional slots. Applications do not have control over the
   * number of items allowed in jump lists; excess items added are dropped by the
   * system. Item insertion priority is defined as first to last added. 
   *
   * Users may remove items from jump lists after they are commited. The system
   * tracks removed items between commits. A list of these items is returned by
   * a call to initListBuild. nsIJumpListBuilder does not filter entries added that
   * have been removed since the last commit. To prevent repeatedly adding entries
   * users have removed, applications are encoraged to track removed items 
   * internally.
   *
   * Each list is made up of an array of nsIJumpListItem representing items
   * such as shortcuts, links, and separators. See nsIJumpListItem for information
   * on adding additional jump list types.
