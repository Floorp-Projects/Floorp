% Note: The original name of this file was 'bghyphsi.tex' which is
%   part of the package 'bghyphen'. The package 'bghyphen' is now
%   obsolete but it is still available on CTAN and currently (June 2008)
%   gives the same hyphenation results.
%
%
%
% To make TeX use these patterns:
%
%    (1) Make sure that the hyph-utf8 package is present in your TeX
%        system.
%
%    (2) generate the necessary formats (TeX, LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, etc),
%        instructing TeX to load 'loadhyph-bg.tex' for Bulgarian
%        hyphenation.
%
% The LaTeX babel package sets \lefthyphenmin and \righthyphenmin to 2
%   when the language is switched to Bulgarian.  Developers who write
%   support for Bulgarian outside LaTeX and/or babel need to take care
%   of this.
