Swedish hyphenation patterns (Jan Michael Rynning, 1994-03-03)

(more info about the licence to be added later)

% This file is part of hyph-utf8 package and resulted from
% semi-manual conversions of hyphenation patterns into UTF-8 in June 2008.

% Source: sehyph.tex (2003-09-08)
% Author: Jan Michael Rynning
%
% The above mentioned file should become obsolete,
% and the author of the original file should preferaby modify this file instead.
%
% Modificatios were needed in order to support native UTF-8 engines,
% but functionality (hopefully) didn't change in any way, at least not intentionally.
% This file is no longer stand-alone; at least for 8-bit engines
% you probably want to use loadhyph-foo.tex (which will load this file) instead.
%
% Modifications were done by Jonathan Kew, Mojca Miklavec & Arthur Reutenauer
% with help & support from:
% - Karl Berry, who gave us free hands and all resources
% - Taco Hoekwater, with useful macros
% - Hans Hagen, who did the unicodifisation of patterns already long before
%               and helped with testing, suggestions and bug reports
% - Norbert Preining, who tested & integrated patterns into TeX Live
%
% However, the "copyright/copyleft" owner of patterns remains the original author.
%
% The copyright statement of this file is thus:
%
%    Do with this file whatever needs to be done in future for the sake of
%    "a better world" as long as you respect the copyright of original file.
%    If you're the original author of patterns or taking over a new revolution,
%    plese remove all of the TUG comments & credits that we added here -
%    you are the Queen / the King, we are only the servants.
%
% If you want to change this file, rather than uploading directly to CTAN,
% we would be grateful if you could send it to us (http://tug.org/tex-hyphen)
% or ask for credentials for SVN repository and commit it yourself;
% we will then upload the whole "package" to CTAN.
%
% Before a new "pattern-revolution" starts,
% please try to follow some guidelines if possible:
%
% - \lccode is *forbidden*, and I really mean it
% - all the patterns should be in UTF-8
% - the only "allowed" TeX commands in this file are: \patterns, \hyphenation,
%   and if you really cannot do without, also \input and \message
% - in particular, please no \catcode or \lccode changes,
%   they belong to loadhyph-foo.tex,
%   and no \lefthyphenmin and \righthyphenmin,
%   they have no influence here and belong elsewhere
% - \begingroup and/or \endinput is not needed
% - feel free to do whatever you want inside comments
%
% We know that TeX is extremely powerful, but give a stupid parser
% at least a chance to read your patterns.

% Last update: 1994-03-03 (March 3, 1994).
% Revision history:
% 1991-01-08: First version available for anonymous FTP.
% 1991-08-08: Changed \aa to \aa0 at end of line, to stop TeX from
%             concatenating the patterns.
% 1991-09-03: Cleaned up lots of inconsistencies in the dictionary.
%             As a consequence, the patterns shrunk a lot.  Also
%             added some 4000 one-syllable words, some of which were
%             hyphenated by the old patterns, and some 1500 compound
%             words, about half of which were incorrectly hyphenated
%             by the old patterns.
% 1991-11-01: Added another some 6200 compound words, all of which were
%             incorrectly hyphenated by the old patterns.
% 1991-11-13: Added another some 6500 compound words, all of which were
%             incorrectly hyphenated by the old patterns.
% 1992-01-30: Changed macros to ^^, for use with LaTeX and dc fonts.
% 1994-03-03: The hyphenated dictionary now contains about 118,000 words.
%             The hyphenation now works much better for compound words.
%             Patgen parameters: 1 2 20, 2 1 8, 1 4 7, 3 2 1, 1 10000 4.
%
% This file contains Swedish hyphenation patterns for TeX.  It assumes
% that you have fonts with the Swedish letters in the positions where
% they occur in ISO Latin 1 (ISO 8859/1):
% Letter:   \AA  \"A  \"O  \'E  \aa  \"a  \"o  \'e
% Position: "C5  "C4  "D6  "C9  "E5  "E4  "F6  "E9
%
% Load this file into initex after plain.tex (or lplain.tex, splain.tex,
% or whatever).
%
% The patterns were generated in such a way that they will hyphenate
% correctly if \lefthyphenmin>=1 and \righthyphenmin>=2.
%
% These hyphenation patterns work quite well for simple words, but not
% quite as well for compound words.  I'm working on improving the quality,
% by adding more words.  If you know any Swedish words which are not
% correctly hypheneted using these patterns, or if you have questions or
% comments, please contact me:
