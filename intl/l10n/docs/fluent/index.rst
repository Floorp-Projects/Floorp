`Fluent`_ is a localization system developed by Mozilla, which aims to replace
all existing localization models currently used at Mozilla.

In case of Firefox it directly supersedes DTD and StringBundle systems, providing
a large number of features and improvements over both of them, for developers
and localizers.
