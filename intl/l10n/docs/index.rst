Localization
============

Localization – sometimes written as l10n, where 10 is the number of letters between `l` and `n` –
is an aspect of internationalization focused on adapting software to
different cultural and regional needs.

The boundary between internationalization and localization is fuzzy. At Mozilla
we refer to localization when we talk about adapting the user interface
and messages, while internationalization handles operations on raw data.

.. note::

  Localization is a broader term than translation because it involves extensive research
  into the target culture, and in result touches not only text and UI translation but also
  cultural adaptation of icons, communication styles, colors, and UX.
