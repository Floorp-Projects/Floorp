About the hyphenation code in this directory
============================================

The hyphen directory comes from the Hyphen library, part of the hunspell project.
  https://github.com/hunspell/hyphen

This code is distributed under the GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1/MPL 1.1 tri-license, as
detailed in the associated README and COPYING files.

Note that we do not include other tools and resources found in the complete
Hyphen package from upstream, so the original README.* files may refer to
additional files that are not present in the Mozilla source tree.
