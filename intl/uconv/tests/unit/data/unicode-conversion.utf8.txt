This is a Unicode converter test file containing Unicode data.  Its encoding is
determined by the second-to-last dot-separated component of the filename.  For
example, if this file is named foo.utf8.txt, its encoding is UTF-8; if this file
is named foo.utf16le.txt, its encoding is UTF-16LE.  This file is marked as
binary in Mozilla's version control system so that it's not accidentally
"mangled".

The contents of each file must differ ONLY by encoding, so if you edit this file
you must edit all files with the name of this file (with the encoding-specific
part changed).
