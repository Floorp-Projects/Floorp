 * Because it contains a calICalendarView as an anonymous node, not easily
 * accessible, it must therefore expose several of that interface's methods and
 * attributes, as well as its own.
 * 
 * @note Implementations of this interface are intended to be the home
 * for view preference handling.  The lower-level views (ie
 * implementers of calICalendarView) are intended to be pure widgetry,
 * and this sort of view should be pluggable, meaning that callers
 * shouldn't need to know about view-specific preferences.
