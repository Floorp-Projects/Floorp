/**
 *AtkRelationType:
 *@ATK_RELATION_NULL: Not used, represens "no relationship" or an error condition.
 *@ATK_RELATION_CONTROLLED_BY: Indicates an object controlled by one or more target objects.
 *@ATK_RELATION_CONTROLLER_FOR: Indicates an object is an controller for one or more target objects.
 *@ATK_RELATION_LABEL_FOR: Indicates an object is a label for one or more target objects.
 *@ATK_RELATION_LABELLED_BY: Indicates an object is labelled by one or more target objects.
 *@ATK_RELATION_MEMBER_OF: Indicates an object is a member of a group of one or more target objects.
 *@ATK_RELATION_NODE_CHILD_OF: Indicates an object is a cell in a treetable which is displayed because a cell in the same column is expanded and identifies that cell.
 *@ATK_RELATION_FLOWS_TO: Indicates that the object has content that flows logically to another
 *  AtkObject in a sequential way, (for instance text-flow).
 *@ATK_RELATION_FLOWS_FROM: Indicates that the object has content that flows logically from
 *  another AtkObject in a sequential way, (for instance text-flow).
 *@ATK_RELATION_SUBWINDOW_OF: Indicates a subwindow attached to a component but otherwise has no connection in  the UI heirarchy to that component.
 *@ATK_RELATION_EMBEDS: Indicates that the object visually embeds 
 *  another object's content, i.e. this object's content flows around 
 *  another's content.
 *@ATK_RELATION_EMBEDDED_BY: Reciprocal of %ATK_RELATION_EMBEDS, indicates that
 *  this object's content is visualy embedded in another object.
 *@ATK_RELATION_POPUP_FOR: Indicates that an object is a popup for another object.
 *@ATK_RELATION_PARENT_WINDOW_OF: Indicates that an object is a parent window of another object.
 *@ATK_RELATION_DESCRIBED_BY: Reciprocal of %ATK_RELATION_DESCRIPTION_FOR. Indicates that one
 * or more target objects provide descriptive information about this object. This relation
 * type is most appropriate for information that is not essential as its presentation may
 * be user-configurable and/or limited to an on-demand mechanism such as an assistive
 * technology command. For brief, essential information such as can be found in a widget's
 * on-screen label, use %ATK_RELATION_LABELLED_BY. For an on-screen error message, use
 * %ATK_RELATION_ERROR_MESSAGE. For lengthy extended descriptive information contained in
 * an on-screen object, consider using %ATK_RELATION_DETAILS as assistive technologies may
 * provide a means for the user to navigate to objects containing detailed descriptions so
 * that their content can be more closely reviewed.
 *@ATK_RELATION_DESCRIPTION_FOR: Reciprocal of %ATK_RELATION_DESCRIBED_BY. Indicates that this
 * object provides descriptive information about the target object(s). See also
 * %ATK_RELATION_DETAILS_FOR and %ATK_RELATION_ERROR_FOR.
 *@ATK_RELATION_NODE_PARENT_OF: Indicates an object is a cell in a treetable and is expanded to display other cells in the same column.
 *@ATK_RELATION_DETAILS: Reciprocal of %ATK_RELATION_DETAILS_FOR. Indicates that this object
 * has a detailed or extended description, the contents of which can be found in the target
 * object(s). This relation type is most appropriate for information that is sufficiently
 * lengthy as to make navigation to the container of that information desirable. For less
 * verbose information suitable for announcement only, see %ATK_RELATION_DESCRIBED_BY. If
 * the detailed information describes an error condition, %ATK_RELATION_ERROR_FOR should be
 * used instead. @Since: ATK-2.26.
 *@ATK_RELATION_DETAILS_FOR: Reciprocal of %ATK_RELATION_DETAILS. Indicates that this object
 * provides a detailed or extended description about the target object(s). See also
 * %ATK_RELATION_DESCRIPTION_FOR and %ATK_RELATION_ERROR_FOR. @Since: ATK-2.26.
 *@ATK_RELATION_ERROR_MESSAGE: Reciprocal of %ATK_RELATION_ERROR_FOR. Indicates that this object
 * has one or more errors, the nature of which is described in the contents of the target
 * object(s). Objects that have this relation type should also contain %ATK_STATE_INVALID_ENTRY
 * in their #AtkStateSet. @Since: ATK-2.26.
 *@ATK_RELATION_ERROR_FOR: Reciprocal of %ATK_RELATION_ERROR_MESSAGE. Indicates that this object
 * contains an error message describing an invalid condition in the target object(s). @Since:
 * ATK_2.26.
 *@ATK_RELATION_LAST_DEFINED: Not used, this value indicates the end of the enumeration.
 * 
 *Describes the type of the relation
