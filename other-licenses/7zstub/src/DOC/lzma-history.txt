HISTORY of the LZMA SDK
-----------------------

18.05          2018-04-30
-------------------------
- The speed for LZMA/LZMA2 compressing was increased 
    by 8% for fastest/fast compression levels and 
    by 3% for normal/maximum compression levels.
- Previous versions of 7-Zip could work incorrectly in "Large memory pages" mode in
  Windows 10 because of some BUG with "Large Pages" in Windows 10. 
  Now 7-Zip doesn't use "Large Pages" on Windows 10 up to revision 1709 (16299).
- The BUG was fixed in Lzma2Enc.c
    Lzma2Enc_Encode2() function worked incorretly,
      if (inStream == NULL) and the number of block threads is more than 1.


18.03 beta     2018-03-04
-------------------------
- Asm\x86\LzmaDecOpt.asm: new optimized LZMA decoder written in asm 
  for x64 with about 30% higher speed than main version of LZMA decoder written in C.
- The speed for single-thread LZMA/LZMA2 decoder written in C was increased by 3%.
- 7-Zip now can use multi-threading for 7z/LZMA2 decoding,
  if there are multiple independent data chunks in LZMA2 stream.
- 7-Zip now can use multi-threading for xz decoding,
  if there are multiple blocks in xz stream.


18.01          2019-01-28
-------------------------
- The BUG in 17.01 - 18.00 beta was fixed:
  XzDec.c : random block unpacking and XzUnpacker_IsBlockFinished()
  didn't work correctly for xz archives without checksum (CRC).


18.00 beta     2019-01-10
-------------------------
- The BUG in xz encoder was fixed:
  There was memory leak of 16 KB for each file compressed with 
  xz compression method, if additional filter was used.


17.01 beta     2017-08-28
-------------------------
- Minor speed optimization for LZMA2 (xz and 7z) multi-threading compression.
  7-Zip now uses additional memory buffers for multi-block LZMA2 compression.
  CPU utilization was slightly improved.
- 7-zip now creates multi-block xz archives by default. Block size can be 
  specified with -ms[Size]{m|g} switch.
- xz decoder now can unpack random block from multi-block xz archives.
- 7-Zip command line: @listfile now doesn't work after -- switch.
  Use -i@listfile before -- switch instead.
- The BUGs were fixed:
  7-Zip 17.00 beta crashed for commands that write anti-item to 7z archive.


17.00 beta     2017-04-29
-------------------------
- NewHandler.h / NewHandler.cpp: 
    now it redefines operator new() only for old MSVC compilers (_MSC_VER < 1900).
- C/7zTypes.h : the names of variables in interface structures were changed (vt).
- Some bugs were fixed. 7-Zip could crash in some cases.
- Some internal changes in code.


16.04          2016-10-04
-------------------------
- The bug was fixed in DllSecur.c.


16.03          2016-09-28
-------------------------
- SFX modules now use some protection against DLL preloading attack.
- Some bugs in 7z code were fixed.


16.02          2016-05-21
-------------------------
- The BUG in 16.00 - 16.01 was fixed:
  Split Handler (SplitHandler.cpp) returned incorrect 
  total size value (kpidSize) for split archives.


16.01          2016-05-19
-------------------------	
- Some internal changes to reduce the number of compiler warnings.


16.00          2016-05-10
-------------------------	
- Some bugs were fixed.


15.12          2015-11-19
-------------------------	
- The BUG in C version of 7z decoder was fixed:
  7zDec.c : SzDecodeLzma2()
  7z decoder could mistakenly report about decoding error for some 7z archives
  that use LZMA2 compression method.
  The probability to get that mistaken decoding error report was about 
  one error per 16384 solid blocks for solid blocks larger than 16 KB (compressed size). 
- The BUG (in 9.26-15.11) in C version of 7z decoder was fixed:
  7zArcIn.c : SzReadHeader2()
  7z decoder worked incorrectly for 7z archives that contain 
  empty solid blocks, that can be placed to 7z archive, if some file is 
  unavailable for reading during archive creation.


15.09 beta     2015-10-16
-------------------------	
- The BUG in LZMA / LZMA2 encoding code was fixed.
  The BUG in LzFind.c::MatchFinder_ReadBlock() function.
  If input data size is larger than (4 GiB - dictionary_size),
  the following code worked incorrectly:
  -  LZMA : LzmaEnc_MemEncode(), LzmaEncode() : LZMA encoding functions 
     for compressing from memory to memory. 
     That BUG is not related to LZMA encoder version that works via streams.
  -  LZMA2 : multi-threaded version of LZMA2 encoder worked incorrectly, if 
     default value of chunk size (CLzma2EncProps::blockSize) is changed 
     to value larger than (4 GiB - dictionary_size).


9.38 beta      2015-01-03
-------------------------	
- The BUG in 9.31-9.37 was fixed:
  IArchiveGetRawProps interface was disabled for 7z archives.
- The BUG in 9.26-9.36 was fixed:
  Some code in CPP\7zip\Archive\7z\ worked correctly only under Windows.


9.36 beta      2014-12-26
-------------------------	
- The BUG in command line version was fixed:
  7-Zip created temporary archive in current folder during update archive
  operation, if -w{Path} switch was not specified. 
  The fixed 7-Zip creates temporary archive in folder that contains updated archive.
- The BUG in 9.33-9.35 was fixed:
  7-Zip silently ignored file reading errors during 7z or gz archive creation,
  and the created archive contained only part of file that was read before error.
  The fixed 7-Zip stops archive creation and it reports about error.
