HISTORY of the 7-Zip source code
--------------------------------

17.00 beta     2017-04-29
-------------------------
- NewHandler.h / NewHandler.cpp: 
    now it redefines operator new() only for old MSVC compilers (_MSC_VER < 1900).
- C/7zTypes.h : the names of variables in interface structures were changed (vt).
- Some bugs were fixed. 7-Zip could crash in some cases.
- Some internal changes in code.


16.02          2016-05-21
-------------------------
- The BUG in 16.00 - 16.01 was fixed:
  Split Handler (SplitHandler.cpp) returned incorrect 
  total size value (kpidSize) for split archives.


16.01          2016-05-19
-------------------------	
- Some bugs were fixed,
- Some internal changes to reduce the number of compiler warnings.


16.00          2016-05-10
-------------------------	
- 7-Zip now can extract multivolume ZIP archives (z01, z02, ... , zip).
- Some bugs were fixed,


15.12          2015-11-19
-------------------------	
- The BUG in C version of 7z decoder was fixed:
  7zDec.c : SzDecodeLzma2()
  7z decoder could mistakenly report about decoding error for some 7z archives
  that use LZMA2 compression method.
  The probability to get that mistaken decoding error report was about 
  one error per 16384 solid blocks for solid blocks larger than 16 KB (compressed size). 
- The BUG (in 9.26-15.11) in C version of 7z decoder was fixed:
  7zArcIn.c : SzReadHeader2()
  7z decoder worked incorrectly for 7z archives that contain 
  empty solid blocks, that can be placed to 7z archive, if some file is 
  unavailable for reading during archive creation.


15.09 beta     2015-10-16
-------------------------	
- The BUG in LZMA / LZMA2 encoding code was fixed.
  The BUG in LzFind.c::MatchFinder_ReadBlock() function.
  If input data size is larger than (4 GiB - dictionary_size),
  the following code worked incorrectly:
  -  LZMA : LzmaEnc_MemEncode(), LzmaEncode() : LZMA encoding functions 
     for compressing from memory to memory. 
     That BUG is not related to LZMA encoder version that works via streams.
  -  LZMA2 : multi-threaded version of LZMA2 encoder worked incorrectly, if 
     default value of chunk size (CLzma2EncProps::blockSize) is changed 
     to value larger than (4 GiB - dictionary_size).


9.38 beta      2015-01-03
-------------------------	
- The BUG in 9.31-9.37 was fixed:
  IArchiveGetRawProps interface was disabled for 7z archives.
- The BUG in 9.26-9.36 was fixed:
  Some code in CPP\7zip\Archive\7z\ worked correctly only under Windows.


9.36 beta      2014-12-26
-------------------------	
- The BUG in command line version was fixed:
  7-Zip created temporary archive in current folder during update archive
  operation, if -w{Path} switch was not specified. 
  The fixed 7-Zip creates temporary archive in folder that contains updated archive.
- The BUG in 9.33-9.35 was fixed:
  7-Zip silently ignored file reading errors during 7z or gz archive creation,
  and the created archive contained only part of file that was read before error.
  The fixed 7-Zip stops archive creation and it reports about error.


9.31           2012-10-31
-------------------------
- InBuffer.h : CInBuffer  uses ISequentialInStream  *_stream; instead of CMyComPtr<ISequentialInStream> 
  OutBuffer.h: COutBuffer uses ISequentialOutStream *_stream; instead of CMyComPtr<ISequentialOutStream> 
	

9.26           2011-04-11
-------------------------
- The BUG was fixed: multi-threaded ZIP stored file size that was at scan stage,
  So if the file was changed after scan, the Unpack Size field was incorrect
	

9.21           2011-04-11
-------------------------	
- New class FString for file names at file systems.
- Speed optimization in CRC code for big-endian CPUs.


9.18           2010-11-02
-------------------------	
- New small SFX module for installers (C/Util/SfxSetup).


9.17           2010-10-04
-------------------------
- IStream.h::IOutStream::
    STDMETHOD(SetSize)(Int64 newSize) PURE;
  was changed to
    STDMETHOD(SetSize)(UInt64 newSize) PURE;


9.09           2009-12-12
-------------------------
- The bug was fixed:
   Utf16_To_Utf8 funstions in UTFConvert.cpp and 7zMain.c
   incorrectly converted surrogate characters (the code >= 0x10000) to UTF-8.


9.05           2009-07-05
-------------------------
- FileMapping.h::CFileMapping now returns WRes


9.04           2009-05-30
-------------------------
- ICoder.h: NCoderPropID::EEnum values were changed


9.02           2009-04-23
-------------------------
- Bug was fixed: if swap2 filter was requests at compression,
  7-zip used swap4 filter instead (but id was swap2), so archives were incorrect.
  
4.61           2008-11-23
-------------------------
- Bug in ver. 4.58+ was fixed:
   7-Zip didn't use any -m* switch after -mtc, -mcl or -mcu for .zip archives. 
- Bug in .CAB code was fixed. 7-Zip didn't show some empty files,
  if .CAB archive contains more than one empty file.
   

4.59           2008-07-27
-------------------------
- Bug was fixed:
   LZMA Encoder in fast compression mode could access memory outside of 
   allocated range in some rare cases.
   

4.59 alpha     2008-05-30
-------------------------
- BUGS was fixed: 
    7zOut.cpp: 7-Zip incorrectly wrote size of property records in some cases.
    7zIn.cpp:  7-Zip incorrectly work with archive, containg archive properties.

4.58 alpha 9   2008-04-29
-------------------------
- BUG was fixed: 7-Zip showed incorrect timestamps in ISO files.


4.58 alpha 8   2008-04-15
-------------------------
- BUG in 4.58 alpha 5/6/7 was fixed:
    LZMA encoder worked incorrectly, if lp != 0.
- Unicode (UTF-8) support for filenames in .ZIP archives. Now there are 3 modes:
    1) Default mode: 7-Zip uses UTF-8, if the local code page doesn't contain required symbols.
    2) -mcu switch:  7-Zip uses UTF-8, if there are non-ASCII symbols.
    3) -mcl switch:  7-Zip uses local code page.
- Now it's possible to use -mSW- and -mSW+ switches instead of -mSW=off and -mSW=on  


4.58 alpha 7   2008-04-08
-------------------------
- BUG was fixed: BZip2Encoder and BZip2Decoder used CEvent objects without 
  creating, when BZip2 code was called with one thread (with -mmt1 switch or with 
  default switches on single thread CPU).
- .lzma support.
- RPM and NSIS support was improved.
- LZMA now stores only (2 << n) or (3 << n) dictionary size value to LZMA properties.


4.58 alpha 6   2008-03-27
-------------------------
- NTFS time extra in ZIP.
- New item property - kpidTimeType - VT_UI4 (0 - NTFS, 1 - Unix, 2 - DOS).
- Static CRC table is not required now for Lzma Encoder (in Lz MatchFinder).


4.58 alpha 5   2008-03-19
-------------------------
- Creation time (-mtc switch) for .7z archives
- LZMA encoder was converted to ANSI-C


4.58 alpha 3   2008-02-25
-------------------------
- Speed optimizations for LZMA decoding. Now it uses C code instead of C++.
- 7-Zip now has 128 MB dictionary limit for 32-bit version:
  It's for speed optimization: kNumLogBits = 9 + sizeof(size_t) / 2;
- TAR: 'D' link flag support.
- 7-Zip now can unpack multivolume RAR archives created with 
  "old style volume names" scheme (-vn switch) and names *.001, *.002, ...
- Fixed bugs:
  - 7-Zip FM could not copy / move files to root network folders like \\COMPNAME\FOLDERNAME\
    In case of move it removed original files.
  - SFX-WIN: if there are errors, it still could return 0.
  - ZIP (.XPS file) isZip64 && thisDiskNumber16 == 0xFFFF.
  - ZIP name updating:
      If zip file contains extra field and you try to change properties of files,
      7-zip tries to delete all extra fileds (except for WzAES).
      And that code could hang.
  -  7-Zip GUI didn't suggest BZip2 dictionary size used in previous run.
  -  If creation time stamp was included in .RAR archive, 7-zip used creation time stamp 
     as modification time stamp.

4.58 alpha 2   2007-12-31
-------------------------
- Small changes in Deflate and LZMA compression.
- Some speed optimizations.

4.45 beta      2007-04-16

- Method ID in .7z now is 63-bit integer (UInt64).
- Open error messages
- unRar 1.5 fixed

4.44 beta      2007-01-20
-------------------------

  it was:
    data++
  fixed version:
    data = _matchFinder.GetPointerToCurrentPos(_matchFinderObj) - 1;
  It could lead to very small cpmpression ratio decreasing when block needs move.
