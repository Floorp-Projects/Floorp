/** @brief This interface represents images and icons.

 This interface is used for a representation of images like icons on buttons.
  %IAccessibleImage only needs to be implemented in certain situations.  Some
  examples are:
  <ol>
   <li>The accessible name and description are not enough to fully
    describe the image, e.g. when the accessible description is used to define the
    behavior of an actionable image and the image itself conveys semantically
    significant information.
   <li>The user can edit the content that includes an
    image and therefore the user needs to be able to review the image's position.
  </ol>
