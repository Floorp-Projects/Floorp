   The returned strings are the localized human readable key sequences to be
   used to activate each action, e.g. "Ctrl+Shift+D".  Since these key
   sequences are to be used when the object has focus, they are like
   mnemonics (access keys), and not like shortcut (accelerator) keys.

   There is no need to implement this method for single action controls since
   that would be redundant with the standard MSAA programming practice of
   getting the mnemonic from get_accKeyboardShortcut.

   An AT such as an On Screen Keyboard might not expose these bindings but
   provide alternative means of activation.

   Note: the client allocates and passes in an array of pointers.  The server
   allocates the BSTRs and passes back one or more pointers to these BSTRs into
   the array of pointers allocated by the client.  The client is responsible 
   for deallocating the BSTRs.

 @section _errors Error Handling
  HRESULT values are defined by the Microsoft&reg; Win32&reg; API.  For more information, refer to
  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa378137%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">
  Interpreting HRESULT Values</a> in MSDN&reg;.

  Note that the S_FALSE return value is considered a non-error value and the 
  SUCCEEDED macro will return TRUE.  S_FALSE is used when there is no failure
  but there was nothing valid to return, e.g. in IAccessible2::attributes when
  there are no attributes.  When S_FALSE is returned [out] pointer types should 
  be NULL and [out] longs should generally be 0, but sometimes -1 is used such
  as IAccessible2::indexInParent, IAccessibleText::caretOffset, and
  IAccessibleHypertext::hyperlinkIndex.

  Note that for BSTR [out] variables common COM practice is that the server does 
  the SysAllocString and the client does the SysFreeString.  Also note that when
  NULL is returned there is no need for the client to call SysFreeString.  Please
  refer to the documentation for each method for more details regarding error handling.

 @section _memory Memory Management
  The following memory management issues should be considered:
  @li Although [out] BSTR variables are declared by the client, their space is 
   allocated by the server.  They need to be freed with SysFreeString by the 
   client at end of life; the same is true when BSTRs are used in structs or 
   arrays which are passed to the server.
  @li If there is no valid [out] BSTR to return, the server should return S_FALSE and 
   assign NULL to the output, e.g. *theOutBSTR = NULL;. 
  @li COM interfaces need to be referenced with AddRef when used and dereferenced
   with Release at end of life.
  @li Single [out] longs, HWNDs, booleans, and structs are declared by the caller
   and passed by reference. The marshaller does all the memory management.
  
  The following articles may be helpful for understanding memory management issues:
  @li An article by Don Box in a
   <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msj/1196/activex1196.aspx">Q & A section</a>
   of the November 1996 edition of the Microsoft Systems Journal.
  @li A posting to a CodeGuru forum, 
   <a href="http://www.codeguru.com/forum/showthread.php?t=364511">Windows SDK 
   String: What are the rules for BSTR allocation and deallocation?</a>

 @subsection _arrayConsideration Special Consideration when using Arrays
  There are several methods which return arrays.  In the case of IAccessible2::relations
  and IAccessibleRelation::targets the client must allocate and free the arrays.

  For the remaining methods which return arrays, the server must allocate the array
  and the client must free the array when no longer needed.  These methods are
  IAccessible2::extendedStates, IAccessible2::localizedExtendedStates,
  IAccessible2_2::relationTargetsOfType, IAccessibleAction::keyBinding, 
  IAccessibleHypertext2::hyperlinks, IAccessibleTable::selectedChildren, 
  IAccessibleTable::selectedColumns, IAccessibleTable::selectedRows,
  IAccessibleTable2::selectedCells, IAccessibleTable2::selectedColumns,
  IAccessibleTable2::selectedRows, IAccessibleTableCell::columnHeaderCells,
  and IAccessibleTableCell::rowHeaderCells.
  For those methods, the server must allocate both the top level array and any storage 
  associated with it, e.g. for BSTRs.  The server must allocate the arrays with 
  CoTaskMemAlloc and any BSTRs with SysAllocString.  The client must use CoTaskMemFree
  to free the array and any BSTRs must be freed with SysFreeString.  
  
  Also, the IDL for IAccessible2::extendedStates, IAccessible2::localizedExtendedStates, 
  IAccessibleAction::keyBinding, IAccessibleTable::selectedChildren, 
  IAccessibleTable::selectedColumns, and IAccessibleTable::selectedRows includes an
  extraneous [in] parameter for the caller to specify the max size of the array.
  This parameter will be ignored by the COM server.

 @section _indexes Zero and One Based Indexes
  Unless otherwise specified all offsets and indexes are 0 based. 

 @section _enumBase Enum Base
  Note that enums start at 0.

 @section _specialOffsets Special Offsets for use in the IAccessibleText and IAccessibleEditableText Methods
  IAccessibleText and IAccessibleEditableText can use one or more of the following
  special offset values.  They are defined in the ::IA2TextSpecialOffsets enum.
  @li Using ::IA2_TEXT_OFFSET_LENGTH (-1) as an offset in any of the IAccessibleText or
   IAccessibleEditableText methods is the same as specifying the length of the string.
  @li Using ::IA2_TEXT_OFFSET_CARET (-2) as an offset for IAccessibleText::textBeforeOffset, 
   IAccessibleText::textAtOffset, and IAccessibleText::textAfterOffset indicates that the 
   text related to the physical location of the caret should be used.  This is needed for 
   applications that consider the character offset of the end of one line (as reached by 
   pressing the End key) the same as the offset of the first character on the next line.
   Since the same offset is associated with two different lines a special means is needed 
   to fetch text from the line where the caret is physically located.

 @section _dicoveringInterfaces Discovery of Interfaces
  In general AT (Assistive Technology) should try IAccessible2 interfaces, followed by using 
  the MSAA (Microsoft&reg; Active Accessibility&reg;) interfaces.  (In cases where the an application
  is known to have custom interfaces which provide information not supplied by IAccessible2
  or MSAA, then those custom interfaces can be used.)  The AT can then, by default, support
  unknown IAccessible2/MSAA applications, without the application developers having to request
  AT vendors for support on an individual application by application basis.

  When you have a reference to an IAccessible and require a reference to an IAccessible2 use 
  QueryService as follows:
  @code
  // pAcc is a reference to the accessible object's IAccessible interface. 
  IServiceProvider *pService = NULL; 
  hr = pAcc->QueryInterface(IID_IServiceProvider, (void **)&pService); 
  if(SUCCEEDED(hr)) { 
    IAccessible2 *pIA2 = NULL; 
    hr = pService->QueryService(IID_IAccessible, IID_IAccessible2, (void**)&pIA2); 
    if (SUCCEEDED(hr) && pIA2) { 
      // The control supports IAccessible2. 
      // pIA2 is the reference to the accessible object's IAccessible2 interface.
    } 
  } 
  @endcode

  @section _changingInterfaces Changing between Accessible Interfaces
  Note that developers must always implement MSAA's IAccessible and, if needed, some
  of the interfaces in the set of IAccessible2 interfaces.  Although the IAccessible2
  IDL is coded such that IAccessible2 is a subclass of MSAA's IAccessible, none of
  MSAA's IAccessible methods are redefined by IAccessible2.

  QueryService must be used to switch from a reference to an MSAA IAccessible interface 
  to another interface.  This has been 
  <a href="http://www.atia.org/files/public/Introducing_IAccessibleEx.doc">
  documented</a> and the pertinent facts have been extracted below: 

  @par 
   Why use QueryService instead of just using QueryInterface to get IAccessibleEx 
   directly? The reason is that since MSAA 2.0, clients don't talk to a server's 
   IAccessible interface directly; instead they talk to an intermediate MSAA-provided 
   wrapper that calls through to the original IAccessible. This wrapper provides services 
   such as implementing IDispatch, supplying information from MSAA 2.0's Dynamic Annotation 
   service, and scaling locations when running on Windows Vista with DPI scaling enabled. 
   QueryService is the supported way to expose additional interfaces from an existing 
   IAccessible and was originally used by MSHTML to expose IHTMLElement objects corresponding 
   to IAccessibles. QueryService is often more convenient for servers to implement than 
   QueryInterface because it does not have the same requirements for preserving object 
   identity or symmetry/transitivity as QueryInterface, so QueryService allows servers to 
   easily implement the interface on the same object or a separate object. The latter is 
   often hard to do with QueryInterface unless the original object supports aggregation. 

  Two related references in MSDN&reg; are: 
  @li <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms696078(VS.85).aspx">
  "Using QueryService to expose a native object model interface for an IAccessible object"</a>
  @li <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms528415.aspx#acc_obj"> 
  "Accessing the Internet Explorer Object Associated with an Accessible Object"</a>

  Based on this information from Microsoft, QueryService must be used to switch back and forth 
  between a reference to an MSAA IAccessible interface and any of the IAccessible2 interfaces. 

  Regarding switching between any of the IAccessible2 interfaces, applications implementing
  IAccessible2 should implement the IAccessible2 interfaces on a single object since ATs
  will be using QueryInterface to switch between the IAccessilbe2 interfaces.  Implementing
  the IAccessible2 interfaces on separate objects would require the use of QueryService.
  There is one exception, IAccessibleApplication can be implemented on a separate object so
  its common code doesn't have to be included in each accessible object.  ATs should use
  QueryService to access IAccessibleApplication.

 @section _applicationInfo Access to Information about the Application
  Servers implementing IAccessible2 should provide access to the IAccessibleApplication 
  interface via QueryService from any object so that ATs can easily determine specific 
  information about the application such as its name or version.

 @section _childIDs Child IDs
  The IAccessible2 interfaces do not support child IDs, i.e. simple child elements.
  Full accessible objects must be created for each object that supports IAccessible2.
  Therefore MSAA's get_accChild should never return a child ID (other than CHILDID_SELF)
  for an object that implements any of the IAccessible2 interfaces.

  Microsoft's UI Automation specification has the same limitation and this was resolved
  in the UI Automation Express specification by adding IAccessibleEx::GetObjectForChild
  and IAccessibleEx::GetIAccessiblePair.  These methods allow mapping back and forth 
  between an IAccessibleEx and an {IAccessible, Child ID} pair.  A future version of 
  IAccessible2 may include similar methods to map back and forth between an IAccessible2
  and an {IAccessible, Child ID} pair.

 @section _variants VARIANTs
  Some methods return a VARIANT.  Implementers need to make sure that the return type is 
  specified, i.e. VT_I4, VT_IDISPATCH, etc.  The methods that return VARIANTs are 
  IAccessibleHyperlink::anchor, IAccessibleHyperlink::anchorTarget, IAccessibleValue::currentValue,
  IAccessibleValue::maximumValue, IAccessibleValue::minimumValue.

 @section _iaaction-iahyperlink IAccessibleHyperlink as subclass of IAccessibleAction
  In this version of the IDL, IAccessibleHyperlink is a subclass of IAccessibleAction.  
  However, there is no practical need for that inheritance and in some cases, such as
  an image map of smart tags, it doesn't make sense because such an image map doesn't 
  have actionable objects; it's the secondary smart tags that are actionable.  As a 
  result, implementations should not rely on the inheritance as it may be removed in 
  a later version of the IDL.

  /** @brief Returns the unique ID.
   
   The uniqueID is an identifier for this object, is unique within the
   current window, and remains the same for the lifetime of the accessible
   object. 
   
   The uniqueID is not related to:
   - the MSAA objectID which is used by the server to disambiguate between
   IAccessibles per HWND or
   - the MSAA childID which is used to disambiguate between children being
   managed by an IAccessible.

   This value is provided so the AT can have access to a unique runtime persistent 
   identifier even when not handling an event for the object.
   
   An example of when this value is useful is if the AT wants to build a cache. 
   The AT could cache the uniqueIDs in addition to other data being cached. 
   When an event is fired the AT could map the uniqueID to its internal model.
   Thus, if there's a REORDER/SHOW/HIDE event the AT knows which part of the 
   internal structure has been invalidated and can refetch just that part.

   This value can also be used by an AT to determine when the current control
   has changed. If the role is the same for two controls that are adjacent in 
   the tab order, this can be used to detect the new control.

   Another use of this value by an AT is to identify when a grouping object has 
   changed, e.g. when moving from a radio button in one group to a radio button in a 
   different group.

   One means of implementing this would be to create a factory with a 32 bit number 
   generator and a reuse pool.  The number generator would emit numbers starting 
   at 1.  Each time an object's life cycle ended, its number would be saved into a 
   reuse pool.  The number generator would be used whenever the reuse pool was empty.

   Another way to create a unique ID is to generate it from a pointer value, e.g. an
   object's address. That would be unique because no two active objects can use the
   same allocated memory space.

   A use case is when a screen reader is grabbing an entire web page on a page load. 
   Without the availability of windowHandle, the AT would have to get the window handle
   by using WindowFromAccessibleObject on each IAccessible, which is slow because it's 
   implemented by oleacc.dll as a loop which crawls up the ancestor chain and looks for

  However, text can not be modified with this interface.  That is the task 
  of the IAccessibleEditableText interface.
        
 The text length, i.e. the number of characters in the text, is
  returned by IAccessibleText::nCharacters. All methods that operate 
  on particular characters (e.g. IAccessibleText::textAtOffset) use character 
  indices from 0 to length-1. All methods that operate on character positions 
  (e.g. IAccessibleText::text) use indices from 0 to length.

 Please note that accessible text does not necessarily support selection.  
  In this case it should behave as if there where no selection.  An empty 
  selection is used for example to express the current cursor position.

 Refer to @ref _specialOffsets 
  "Special Offsets for use in the IAccessibleText and IAccessibleEditableText Methods"

 This interface is typically used in conjunction with the IAccessibleText

  the copy capability so this interface is not limited to editable objects.

 The substrings used with this interface are specified as follows:

  If endOffset is lower than startOffset,  the result is the same as a call

  the indices zero and IAccessibleText::nCharacters. If both indices have the 
  same value, an empty string is defined.

/** @brief This interface represents hyperlinks.

 This interface represents a hyperlink associated with a single substring 
  of text or single non-text object.  Non-text objects can have either a 
  single link or a collection of links such as when the non-text object is 
  an image map.

 Linked objects and anchors are implementation dependent. This interface is derived
  from IAccessibleAction.  IAccessibleAction::nActions is one greater than the 
  maximum value for the indices used with the methods of this interface.
        
 Furthermore, the object that implements this interface has to be connected 
  implicitly or explicitly with an object that implements IAccessibleText.
  IAccessibleHyperlink::startIndex and IAccessibleHyperlink::endIndex are
  indices with respect to the text exposed by IAccessibleText.

 This interface provides access to a single object which can have multiple actions.
  An example is an image map which is an image with multiple links each of which is
  associated with a separate non-overlapping area of the image.  This interface could
  also be applied to other kinds of objects with multiple actions such as "smart tags"
  which are objects, typically strings, which have multiple actions such as
  "Activate URI", "Bookmark URI", etc.

 An interesting use case is an image map where each area is associated with multiple
  actions, e.g. an image map of smart tags.  In this case you would have to implement
  two levels of accessible hyperlinks.  The first level hyperlinks would only implement
  anchor and anchorTarget.  The anchors would all reference the image object.  The
  anchorTargets would reference the second level accessible hyperlink objects.  None
  of the IAccessibleAction methods would be implemented on the first level hyperlink
  objects.  The second level hyperlink objects would implement the IAccessibleAction
  methods.  Their anchors would also reference the image object and their anchorTargets
  would reference URLs or the objects that would be activated.

 This use case demonstrates that in some cases there is no need for IAccessibleHyperlink
  to derive from IAccessibleAction.  As a result it may be removed in a later version of
  the IDL and it is suggested that implementations should not rely on the inheritance.

/** @brief This interface gives access to a two-dimensional table. 
       
 Typically all accessible objects that represent cells or cell-clusters of a table 
  will be at the same time children of the table.  In this case IAccessible2::indexInParent
  will return the child index which then can be used when calling IAccessibleTable::rowIndex
  and IAccessibleTable::columnIndex.

 However, in some cases that kind of implementation will not be possible.  When
  the table cells are not direct children of a table, the object representing
  the cell can define a "table-cell-index" object attribute identifying the 0 
  based table cell index.  This object attribute is obtained by parsing the
  attribute string returned by IAccessible2::attributes.  The "table-cell-index"
  attribute can be used just like a child index of the typical case.  ATs should 
  first test for the presence of the "table-cell-index" attribute and if it is not
  present then IAccessible2::indexInParent can be used as in the typical case
  where cells are direct children of the table.
              
 The range of valid coordinates for this interface are implementation dependent.  
  However, that range includes at least the intervals from the from the first row 
  or column with the index 0 up to the last (but not including) used row or column 
  as returned by IAccessibleTable::nRows and IAccessibleTable::nColumns.

 Note that newer implementations are now using IAccessibleTable2 and IAccessibleTableCell
  rather than this interface.

 This interface provides the AT with the information it needs to differentiate 
 this application from other applications, from other versions of this 
 application, or from other versions of this application running on different 
 versions of an accessibility bridge or accessibility toolkit.

 Servers implementing IAccessible2 should provide access to the %IAccessibleApplication 
 interface via QueryService from any object so that ATs can easily determine specific 
 information about the application such as its name or version.
