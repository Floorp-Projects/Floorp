    """Generate a v1 android:versionCode.
    The important consideration is that version codes be monotonically
    increasing (per Android package name) for all published builds.  The input
    build IDs are based on timestamps and hence are always monotonically
    increasing.

    The generated v1 version codes look like (in binary):

    0111 1000 0010 tttt tttt tttt tttt txpg

    The 17 bits labelled 't' represent the number of hours since midnight on
    September 1, 2015.  (2015090100 in YYYYMMMDDHH format.)  This yields a
    little under 15 years worth of hourly build identifiers, since 2**17 / (366
    * 24) =~ 14.92.

    The bits labelled 'x', 'p', and 'g' are feature flags.

    The bit labelled 'x' is 1 if the build is for an x86 or x86-64 architecture,
    and 0 otherwise, which means the build is for an ARM or ARM64 architecture.
    (Fennec no longer supports ARMv6, so ARM is equivalent to ARMv7.

     ARM64 is also known as AArch64; it is logically ARMv8.)

    For the same release, x86 and x86_64 builds have higher version codes and
    take precedence over ARM builds, so that they are preferred over ARM on
    devices that have ARM emulation.

    The bit labelled 'p' is 1 if the build is for a 64-bit architecture (x86-64
    or ARM64), and 0 otherwise, which means the build is for a 32-bit
    architecture (x86 or ARM). 64-bit builds have higher version codes so
    they take precedence over 32-bit builds on devices that support 64-bit.

    The bit labelled 'g' is 1 if the build targets a recent API level, which
    is currently always the case, because Firefox no longer ships releases that
    are split by API levels. However, we may reintroduce a split in the future,
    in which case the release that targets an older API level will

    We throw an explanatory exception when we are within one calendar year of
    running out of build events.  This gives lots of time to update the version
    scheme.  The responsible individual should then bump the range (to allow
    builds to continue) and use the time remaining to update the version scheme
    via the reserved high order bits.

    N.B.: the reserved 0 bit to the left of the highest order 't' bit can,
    sometimes, be used to bump the version scheme.  In addition, by reducing the
    granularity of the build identifiers (for example, moving to identifying
    builds every 2 or 4 hours), the version scheme may be adjusted further still
    without losing a (valuable) high order bit.
