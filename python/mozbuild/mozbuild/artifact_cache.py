Fetch and cache artifacts from URLs.

This module manages fetching artifacts from URLS and purging old
artifacts using a simple Least Recently Used cache.

This module requires certain modules be importable from the ambient Python
environment.  Consumers will need to arrange this themselves.

The bulk of the complexity is in managing and persisting several caches.  If
we found a Python LRU cache that pickled cleanly, we could remove a lot of
this code!  Sadly, I found no such candidate implementations, so we pickle
pylru caches manually.

None of the instances (or the underlying caches) are safe for concurrent use.
A future need, perhaps.

    """Handle persistence for a cache of artifacts.

    When instantiating a DownloadManager, it starts by filling the
    PersistLimit instance it's given with register_dir_content.
    In practice, this registers all the files already in the cache directory.
    After a download finishes, the newly downloaded file is registered, and the
    oldest files registered to the PersistLimit instance are removed depending
    on the size and file limits it's configured for.
    This is all good, but there are a few tweaks we want here:
    - We have pickle files in the cache directory that we don't want purged.
    - Files that were just downloaded in the same session shouldn't be purged.
      (if for some reason we end up downloading more than the default max size,
       we don't want the files to be purged)
    To achieve this, this subclass of PersistLimit inhibits the register_file
    method for pickle files and tracks what files were downloaded in the same
    session to avoid removing them.

    The register_file method may be used to register cache matches too, so that
    later sessions know they were freshly used.
