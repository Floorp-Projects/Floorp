    """Represents a moz.build configuration context.

    Instances of this class are filled by the execution of sandboxes.
    At the core, a Context is a dict, with a defined set of possible keys we'll
    call variables. Each variable is associated with a type.

    When reading a value for a given key, we first try to read the existing
    value. If a value is not found and it is defined in the allowed variables
    set, we return a new instance of the class for that variable. We don't
    assign default instances until they are accessed because this makes
    debugging the end-result much simpler. Instead of a data structure with
    lots of empty/default values, you have a data structure with only the
    values that were read or touched.

    Instances of variables classes are created by invoking ``class_name()``,
    except when class_name derives from ``ContextDerivedValue`` or
    ``SubContext``, in which case ``class_name(instance_of_the_context)`` or
    ``class_name(self)`` is invoked. A value is added to those calls when
    instances are created during assignment (setitem).

    allowed_variables is a dict of the variables that can be set and read in
    this context instance. Keys in this dict are the strings representing keys
    in this context which are valid. Values are tuples of stored type,
    assigned type, default value, a docstring describing the purpose of the
    variable, and a tier indicator (see comment above the VARIABLES declaration
    in this module).

    config is the ConfigEnvironment for this context.

    It is common to want to annotate files with metadata, such as which

    The argument to this sub-context is a file matching pattern that is applied
    against the host file's directory. If the pattern matches a file whose info
    is currently being sought, the metadata attached to this instance will be
    applied to that file.

    Patterns are collections of filename characters with ``/`` used as the
    directory separate (UNIX-style paths) and ``*`` and ``**`` used to denote
    wildcard matching.

    Patterns without the ``*`` character are literal matches and will match at
    most one entity.

    Patterns with ``*`` or ``**`` are wildcard matches. ``*`` matches files
    at least within a single directory. ``**`` matches files across several
    directories.

    ``foo.html``
       Will match only the ``foo.html`` file in the current directory.
    ``*.jsm``
       Will match all ``.jsm`` files in the current directory.
    ``**/*.cpp``
       Will match all ``.cpp`` files in this and all child directories.
    ``foo/*.css``
       Will match all ``.css`` files in the ``foo/`` directory.
    ``bar/*``
       Will match all files in the ``bar/`` directory and all of its
       children directories.
    ``bar/**``
       This is equivalent to ``bar/*`` above.
    ``bar/**/foo``
       Will match all ``foo`` files in the ``bar/`` directory and all of its
       children directories.

    The difference in behavior between ``*`` and ``**`` is only evident if
    a pattern follows the ``*`` or ``**``. A pattern ending with ``*`` is
    greedy. ``**`` is needed when you need an additional pattern after the
    wildcard. e.g. ``**/foo``.

            Other components are 'exclusive', meaning that changes to most

            Firefox for Android, OS X, Windows, and Linux, but files under
            `mobile/android/` affect Android builds and tests exclusively, so

        This definition will generate bar.c by calling the main method of
        generate.py with a open (for writing) file object for bar.c, and
        the string ``datafile-for-bar``. In a similar fashion, the main
        method of generate.py will also be called with an open
        (for writing) file object for foo.c and the string
        ``datafile-for-foo``. Please note that only string arguments are
        supported for passing to scripts, and that all arguments provided
        to the script should be filenames relative to the directory in which
        the moz.build file is located.

        To enable using the same script for generating multiple files with
        slightly different non-filename parameters, alternative entry points
        into ``script`` can be specified::

          GENERATED_FILES += ['bar.c']
          bar = GENERATED_FILES['bar.c']
          bar.script = 'generate.py:make_bar'

        The chosen script entry point may optionally return a set of strings,
        indicating extra files the output depends on.

        When the ``flags`` attribute is present, the given list of flags is
        passed as extra arguments following the inputs.

        When the ``force`` attribute is present, the file is generated every
        build, regardless of whether it is stale.  This is special to the
        RecursiveMake backend and intended for special situations only (e.g.,
        localization).  Please consult a build peer (on the #build channel at
        https://chat.mozilla.org) before using ``force``.

        This functions similarly to ``FINAL_TARGET_FILES``, but the files are

        For an en-US build, this is functionally equivalent to

        the file will be taken from ``$LOCALE_SRCDIR``, with the leading

        files in the locale directory.

        Object directory paths are allowed here only if the path matches an entry in
        ``LOCALIZED_GENERATED_FILES``.

        Files that are missing from a locale will typically have the en-US
        version used, but for wildcard expansions only files from the
        locale directory will be used, even if that means no files will

        The two major differences are:
        1. The function in the Python script will be passed an additional keyword argument `locale`
           which provides the locale in use, i.e. ``en-US``.
        2. The ``inputs`` list may contain paths to files that will be taken from the locale

        This is similar to a ``#include`` in C languages. The filename passed to
        the function will be read and its contents will be evaluated within the
        context of the calling file.

        If a relative path is given, it is evaluated as relative to the file
        currently being processed. If there is a chain of multiple include(),
        the relative path computation is from the most recent/active file.

        If an absolute path is given, it is evaluated from ``TOPSRCDIR``. In
        other words, ``include('/foo')`` references the path
        ``TOPSRCDIR + '/foo'``.

        Example usage
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        Include ``sibling.build`` from the current directory.::

           include('sibling.build')

        Include ``foo.build`` from a path within the top source directory::

        environment of all directories specified in the DIRS and TEST_DIRS
        variables. If those directories themselves have child directories,
        the variable will be exported to all of them.

        The value used for the variable is the final value at the end of the
        moz.build file, so it is possible (but not recommended style) to place
        the export before the definition of the variable.

        NOTE: Please consult with a build peer (on the #build channel at

        Templates are a special kind of functions that can be declared in
        mozbuild files. Uppercase variables assigned in the function scope
        are considered to be the result of the template.

        Contrary to traditional python functions:
           - return values from template functions are ignored,
           - template functions don't have access to the global scope.

        Example template
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The following ``Program`` template sets two variables ``PROGRAM`` and
        ``USE_LIBS``. ``PROGRAM`` is set to the argument given on the template
        invocation, and ``USE_LIBS`` to contain "mozglue"::

           @template
           def Program(name):
               PROGRAM = name
               USE_LIBS += ['mozglue']

        Template invocation
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        A template is invoked in the form of a function call::

           Program('myprog')

        The result of the template, being all the uppercase variable it sets
        is mixed to the existing set of variables defined in the mozbuild file
        invoking the template::

           FINAL_TARGET = 'dist/other'
           USE_LIBS += ['mylib']
           Program('myprog')
           USE_LIBS += ['otherlib']

        The above mozbuild results in the following variables set:

           - ``FINAL_TARGET`` is 'dist/other'
           - ``USE_LIBS`` is ['mylib', 'mozglue', 'otherlib']
           - ``PROGRAM`` is 'myprog'
