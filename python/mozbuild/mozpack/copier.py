        Copy all registered files to the given destination path. The given

        The copy process acts a bit like rsync: files are not copied when they
        don't need to (see mozpack.files for details on file.copy).

        By default, files in the destination directory that aren't
        registered are removed and empty directories are deleted. In
        addition, all directory symlinks in the destination directory
        are deleted: this is a conservative approach to ensure that we

        destination directory. In the worst case, we might have a
        directory symlink in the object directory to the source
        directory.

        To disable removing of unregistered files, pass
        remove_unaccounted=False. To disable removing empty
        directories, pass remove_empty_directories=False. In rare
        cases, you might want to maintain directory symlinks in the
        destination directory (at least those that are not required to
        be regular directories): pass
        remove_all_directory_symlinks=False. Exercise caution with
        this flag: you almost certainly do not want to preserve
        directory symlinks.
