# By default, the pre-processor used for jar.mn will use "%" as a marker for ".css" files and "#"
# otherwise. This falls apart when a file using one marker needs to include a file with the other
# marker since the pre-processor instructions in the included file will not be processed. The
# following SVG files need to include a file which uses "%" as the marker so we invoke the pre-
# processor ourselves here with the marker specified. The resulting SVG files will get packaged by
# the processing of the jar file in this directory.
