LIBRARY ntdll

; When we compile with -freestanding, the compiler still requires implementation
; of the four functions listed below.
;
; We could implement our own naive versions of these functions, but that
; solution is less than ideal since the implementations must be extern and are
; thus picked up by the entire firefox.exe binary. This denies the rest of
; firefox.exe the benefit of optimized implementations. On Windows the
; sandbox is linked into firefox.exe, so we cannot just shrug and
; assume that a naive implementation will not have any effect on anything.
;
; There are, however, optimized implementations of these functions that are
; exported by ntdll.dll. OTOH, they are not included in the ntdll.lib
; import library. This .def file is used to build an import library that "fills
; in the blanks" and allows us to link into the ntdll implementations.
