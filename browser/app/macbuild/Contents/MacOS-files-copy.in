# Specifies files that should be copied (via deep copy, resolving symlinks)
# from dist/bin to the .app/Contents/MacOS directory. Linking is preferred to
# reduce disk I/O during builds, so just include dylibs which need to be in the
# same directory as returned by dladddr(3).
#
# Some of these dylibs load other dylibs which are assumed to be siblings in
# the same directory obtained from dladdr(3). With macOS 10.15, dladdr returns
# absolute resolved paths which breaks this assumption if symlinks are used
# because the symlink targets are in different directories. Hence the need for
# them to be copied to the same directory.
