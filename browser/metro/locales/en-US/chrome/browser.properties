# LOCALIZATION NOTE : FILE Capitalized phrases like "Top Sites", "Bookmarks",
# and "Recent History" are typically used as proper noun phrases to refer to
# the specific visual set (usually displayed as a grid) of top sites,
# bookmarks, etc. displayed on screen, rather than those concepts in general.
# Buttons (like with contextAppbar2.pin.topSites) refer to actions against
# the specific on-screen sets with similarly-named headings.
