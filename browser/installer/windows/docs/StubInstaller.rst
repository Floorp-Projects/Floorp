Stub Installer
==============

The stub installer is the default installer interface that most users installing Firefox will see. It's a tiny download (200-300 KB), so it gets the user into the product experience quickly. It's also a highly streamlined experience; there are no options or prompts offered, except in the case of a returning user (see Profile Cleanup). Running the stub installer immediately starts downloading and installing the browser, and automatically runs the new installation and exits when it's done.

An :ref:`Install Ping` is sent when the stub exits.
