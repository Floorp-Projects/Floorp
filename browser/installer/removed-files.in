# The removed-files.in file specifies files and directories to be removed during
# an application update that are not automatically removed by the application
# update process. The application update process handles the vast majority of
# file and directory removals automatically so this file should not be used in
# the vast majority of cases.

# When to use removed-files.in file to remove files and directories:
# * Files and directories located in the installation's "distribution/" and
#   "extensions/" directories that were added before Firefox 27. Files and
#   directories located in these directories were not included in the
#   application update file removals for a complete update prior to Firefox 27.
# * Empty directories that were accidentally added to the installation
#   directory.
# * Third party files and directories that were added to the installation
#   directory. Under normal circumstances this should only be done after release
#   drivers have approved the removal of these third party files.

# If you are not sure whether a file or directory should be removed using the
# removed-files.in file please contact one of the developers that work on
# application update.

# Note: the "distribution/" and "browser/extensions/" directories should never
# be removed recursively since these directories are used by Partner builds and
# custom installations.

# To specify a file to be removed add the path to the file.
# * If the file doesn't exist the update will succeed.
# * If the file exists and can't be removed (e.g. the file is locked) the
#   update will fail.
#
# Example: path/to/file

# To specify a directory to be removed only if it is empty add the path to the
# directory with a trailing forward slash.
# * If the directory doesn't exist the update will succeed.
# * If the directory can't be removed (e.g. the directory is locked, contains
#   files, etc.) the update will succeed.
#
# Example: path/to/dir/

# To specify a directory that should be recursively removed add the path to the
# directory with a trailing forward slash and "*".
# * If the directory doesn't exist the update will succeed.
# * If all of the files the directory contains can be removed but the directory
#   or a subdirectory can't be removed (e.g. the directory is locked) the update
#   will succeed.
# * If a file within the directory can't be removed the update will fail.
#
# Example: path/to/dir/*
