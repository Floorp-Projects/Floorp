  // - 'type' is the type of issue, it determines which text to show in the
  //   infobar.
  // - 'isSolved' is true when the notification actually indicates the
  //   resolution of that issue, to be reported as telemetry.
  // - 'decoderDoctorReportId' is the Decoder Doctor issue identifier, to be
  //   used here as key for the telemetry (counting infobar displays,
  //   "Learn how" buttons clicks, and resolutions) and for the prefs used
  //   to store at-issue formats.
  // - 'formats' contains a comma-separated list of formats (or key systems)
  //   that suffer the issue. These are kept in a pref, which the backend
  //   uses to later find when an issue is resolved.
  // - 'decodeIssue' is a description of the decode error/warning.
  // - 'resourceURL' is the resource with the issue.
