# Variables:
# $hostname (String) - Hostname of the website with cert error.
cert-error-intro = { $hostname } uses an invalid security certificate.

cert-error-mitm-intro = Websites prove their identity via certificates, which are issued by certificate authorities.

cert-error-mitm-mozilla = { -brand-short-name } is backed by the non-profit Mozilla, which administers a completely open certificate authority (CA) store. The CA store helps ensure that certificate authorities are following best practices for user security.

cert-error-mitm-connection = { -brand-short-name } uses the Mozilla CA store to verify that a connection is secure, rather than certificates supplied by the user’s operating system. So, if an antivirus program or a network is intercepting a connection with a security certificate issued by a CA that is not in the Mozilla CA store, the connection is considered unsafe.

cert-error-trust-unknown-issuer-intro = Someone could be trying to impersonate the site and you should not continue.

# Variables:
# $hostname (String) - Hostname of the website with cert error.
cert-error-trust-unknown-issuer = Websites prove their identity via certificates. { -brand-short-name } does not trust { $hostname } because its certificate issuer is unknown, the certificate is self-signed, or the server is not sending the correct intermediate certificates.

cert-error-trust-cert-invalid = The certificate is not trusted because it was issued by an invalid CA certificate.

cert-error-trust-untrusted-issuer = The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate is not trusted.

cert-error-trust-signature-algorithm-disabled = The certificate is not trusted because it was signed using a signature algorithm that was disabled because that algorithm is not secure.

cert-error-trust-expired-issuer = The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate has expired.

cert-error-trust-self-signed = The certificate is not trusted because it is self-signed.

cert-error-trust-symantec = Certificates issued by GeoTrust, RapidSSL, Symantec, Thawte, and VeriSign are no longer considered safe because these certificate authorities failed to follow security practices in the past.

cert-error-untrusted-default = The certificate does not come from a trusted source.

# Variables:
# $hostname (String) - Hostname of the website with cert error.
cert-error-domain-mismatch = Websites prove their identity via certificates. { -brand-short-name } does not trust this site because it uses a certificate that is not valid for { $hostname }.

# Variables:
# $hostname (String) - Hostname of the website with cert error.
# $alt-name (String) - Alternate domain name for which the cert is valid.
cert-error-domain-mismatch-single = Websites prove their identity via certificates. { -brand-short-name } does not trust this site because it uses a certificate that is not valid for { $hostname }. The certificate is only valid for <a data-l10n-name="domain-mismatch-link">{ $alt-name }</a>.

# Variables:
# $hostname (String) - Hostname of the website with cert error.
# $alt-name (String) - Alternate domain name for which the cert is valid.
cert-error-domain-mismatch-single-nolink = Websites prove their identity via certificates. { -brand-short-name } does not trust this site because it uses a certificate that is not valid for { $hostname }. The certificate is only valid for { $alt-name }.

# Variables:
# $subject-alt-names (String) - Alternate domain names for which the cert is valid.
cert-error-domain-mismatch-multiple = Websites prove their identity via certificates. { -brand-short-name } does not trust this site because it uses a certificate that is not valid for { $hostname }. The certificate is only valid for the following names: { $subject-alt-names }

# Variables:
# $hostname (String) - Hostname of the website with cert error.
# $not-after-local-time (Date) - Certificate is not valid after this time.
cert-error-expired-now = Websites prove their identity via certificates, which are valid for a set time period. The certificate for { $hostname } expired on { $not-after-local-time }.

# Variables:
# $hostname (String) - Hostname of the website with cert error.
# $not-before-local-time (Date) - Certificate is not valid before this time.
cert-error-not-yet-valid-now = Websites prove their identity via certificates, which are valid for a set time period. The certificate for { $hostname } will not be valid until { $not-before-local-time }.

# Variables:
# $error (String) - NSS error code string that specifies type of cert error. e.g. unknown issuer, invalid cert, etc.
cert-error-code-prefix-link = Error code: <a data-l10n-name="error-code-link">{ $error }</a>

# Variables:
# $hostname (String) - Hostname of the website with cert error.
cert-error-symantec-distrust-description = Websites prove their identity via certificates, which are issued by certificate authorities. Most browsers no longer trust certificates issued by GeoTrust, RapidSSL, Symantec, Thawte, and VeriSign. { $hostname } uses a certificate from one of these authorities and so the website’s identity cannot be proven.

cert-error-symantec-distrust-admin = You may notify the website’s administrator about this problem.

# Variables:
# $hasHSTS (Boolean) - Indicates whether HSTS header is present.
cert-error-details-hsts-label = HTTP Strict Transport Security: { $hasHSTS }

# Variables:
# $hasHPKP (Boolean) - Indicates whether HPKP header is present.
cert-error-details-key-pinning-label = HTTP Public Key Pinning: { $hasHPKP }

cert-error-details-cert-chain-label = Certificate chain:

open-in-new-window-for-csp-or-xfo-error = Open Site in New Window

# Variables:
# $hostname (String) - Hostname of the website blocked by csp or xfo error.
csp-xfo-blocked-long-desc = To protect your security, { $hostname } will not allow { -brand-short-name } to display the page if another site has embedded it. To see this page, you need to open it in a new window.
