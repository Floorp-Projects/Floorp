# LOCALIZATION NOTE These strings are used inside the Animation inspector
# which is available as a sidebar panel in the Inspector.
# The correct localization of this file might be to keep it in
# English, or another language commonly spoken among web developers.
# You want to make that choice consistent across the developer tools.
# A good criteria is the language in which you'd find the best
# documentation on web development on the web.
