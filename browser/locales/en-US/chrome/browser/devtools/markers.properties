# LOCALIZATION NOTE These strings are used inside the Performance Tools
# which is available from the Web Developer sub-menu -> 'Performance'.
# The correct localization of this file might be to keep it in
# English, or another language commonly spoken among web developers.
# You want to make that choice consistent across the developer tools.
# A good criteria is the language in which you'd find the best
# documentation on web development on the web. These strings
# are specifically for marker names in the performance tool.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (marker.label.*):
# These strings are displayed in the Performance Tool waterfall, identifying markers.

# These strings are used to give an expanded description of why a GC occurred.
marker.gcreason.description.API=There was an API call to force garbage collection.
marker.gcreason.description.EAGER_ALLOC_TRIGGER=JavaScript returned to the event loop and there were enough bytes allocated since the last GC that a new GC cycle was triggered.
marker.gcreason.description.DESTROY_RUNTIME=Firefox destroyed a JavaScript runtime or context, and this was the final garbage collection before shutting down.
marker.gcreason.description.DESTROY_CONTEXT=Firefox destroyed a JavaScript runtime or context, and this was the final garbage collection before shutting down.
marker.gcreason.description.LAST_DITCH=JavaScript attempted to allocate, but there was no memory available. Doing a full compacting garbage collection as an attempt to free up memory for the allocation.
marker.gcreason.description.TOO_MUCH_MALLOC=JavaScript allocated too many bytes, and forced a garbage collection.
marker.gcreason.description.ALLOC_TRIGGER=JavaScript allocated too many times, and forced a garbage collection.
marker.gcreason.description.DEBUG_GC=GC due to Zeal debug settings.
marker.gcreason.description.COMPARTMENT_REVIVED=A global object that was thought to be dead at the start of the GC cycle was revived by the end of the GC cycle.
marker.gcreason.description.RESET=The active incremental GC cycle was forced to finish immediately.
marker.gcreason.description.OUT_OF_NURSERY=JavaScript allocated enough new objects in the nursery that it became full and triggered a minor GC.
marker.gcreason.description.EVICT_NURSERY=Work needed to be done on the tenured heap, requiring the nursery to be empty.
marker.gcreason.description.FULL_STORE_BUFFER=There were too many properties on tenured objects whose value was an object in the nursery.
marker.gcreason.description.SHARED_MEMORY_LIMIT=A large allocation was requested, but there was not enough memory.
marker.gcreason.description.PERIODIC_FULL_GC=JavaScript returned to the event loop, and it has been a relatively long time since Firefox performed a garbage collection.
marker.gcreason.description.INCREMENTAL_TOO_SLOW=A full, non-incremental garbage collection was triggered because there was a faster rate of allocations than the existing incremental garbage collection cycle could keep up with.
marker.gcreason.description.COMPONENT_UTILS=Components.utils.forceGC() was called to force a garbage collection.
marker.gcreason.description.MEM_PRESSURE=There was very low memory available.
marker.gcreason.description.CC_WAITING=The cycle collector required a garbage collection.
marker.gcreason.description.CC_FORCED=The cycle collector required a garbage collection.
marker.gcreason.description.LOAD_END=The document finished loading.
marker.gcreason.description.PAGE_HIDE=The tab or window was moved to the background.

marker.gcreason.description.SET_DOC_SHELL=The page has been navigated to a new document.
marker.gcreason.description.DOM_UTILS=There was an API call to force garbage collection.
marker.gcreason.description.DOM_IPC=Received an inter-process message that requested a garbage collection.
marker.gcreason.description.DOM_WORKER=The worker was idle for a relatively long time.
marker.gcreason.description.INTER_SLICE_GC=There has been a relatively long time since the last incremental GC slice.
marker.gcreason.description.FULL_GC_TIMER=JavaScript returned to the event loop, and it has been a relatively long time since we performed a garbage collection.
marker.gcreason.description.SHUTDOWN_CC=Firefox destroyed a JavaScript runtime or context, and this was the final garbage collection before shutting down.
marker.gcreason.description.FINISH_LARGE_EVALUATE=Firefox finished evaluating a large script, and performed a GC because the script will never be run again.
marker.gcreason.description.DOM_WINDOW_UTILS=The user was inactive for a long time. Took the opportunity to perform GC when it was unlikely to be noticed.
marker.gcreason.description.USER_INACTIVE=The user was inactive for a long time. Firefox took the opportunity to perform GC when it was unlikely to be noticed.
