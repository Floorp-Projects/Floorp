# LOCALIZATION NOTE (initTilt.error): Tilt requires WebGL capabilities, which
# are not available on every hardware. This message is displayed as an modal
# popup window when initialization fails because of unsupported hardware.
initTilt.error = Could not initialize Tilt, please check the\ntroubleshooting information available at http://get.webgl.org/troubleshooting

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (initWebGL.error): Tilt requires WebGL capabilities, which

# when initialization fails because of unsupported hardware.
initWebGL.error = Could not initialize the WebGL context, your hardware or drivers may not support it.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (linkProgram.error): This error happens when the WebGL

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (compileShader.source.error): This error is caused when the
# source (uri or path) of a shader is not the expected one. It is displayed in
# the Error Console.
compileShader.source.error = Bad shader source type (expected String).

# LOCALIATION NOTE (compileShader.type.error): There are two types of shader
# programs - vertex and fragment. At a shader initialization, if none of these
# two types is specified, this compile-time error is shown. It is displayed in
# the Error Console.
compileShader.type.error = Wrong shader type specified for: %S

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (compileShader.compile.error): If the shader source and
# type are correctly specified, there may be syntax errors in the shader code.
# If this is the case, this compile-time error is shown. It is displayed in
# the Error Console.
compileShader.compile.error = Shader compile status:\n%S
