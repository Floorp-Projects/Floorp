# LOCALIZATION NOTE These strings are used inside the Inspector
# which is available from the Web Developer sub-menu -> 'Inspect'.
#
# The correct localization of this file might be to keep it in
# English, or another language commonly spoken among web developers.
# You want to make that choice consistent across the developer tools.
# A good criteria is the language in which you'd find the best
# documentation on web development on the web.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (noManifest): Used when an attempt is made to validate a
# page using AppCacheUtils.jsm that has no cache manifest.
noManifest=The specified page has no manifest.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (notUTF8): Used when an attempt is made to validate a
# cache manifest using AppCacheUtils.jsm having a character encoding that is not
# UTF-8.
notUTF8=Manifest has a character encoding of %S. Manifests must have the utf-8 character encoding.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (badMimeType): Used when an attempt is made to validate a
# cache manifest using AppCacheUtils.jsm having a mimetype that is not
# text/cache-manifest.
badMimeType=Manifest has a mimetype of %S. Manifests must have a mimetype of text/cache-manifest.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (duplicateURI): Used when an attempt is made to validate a
# page using AppCacheUtils.jsm that has a cache manifest which references the
# same URI from multiple locations.
duplicateURI=URI %S is referenced in multiple locations. This is not allowed: %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (networkBlocksURI): Used when an attempt is made to validate
# a page using AppCacheUtils.jsm that has a cache manifest which references the
# same URI in the NETWORK section as it does in other sections.
networkBlocksURI=NETWORK section line %S (%S) prevents caching of line %S (%S) in the %S section.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (fallbackBlocksURI): Used when an attempt is made to
# validate a page using AppCacheUtils.jsm that has a cache manifest which
# references the same URI in the FALLBACK section as it does in other sections.
fallbackBlocksURI=FALLBACK section line %S (%S) prevents caching of line %S (%S) in the %S section.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (fileChangedButNotManifest): Used when an attempt is made to
# validate a page using AppCacheUtils.jsm that has a cache manifest which
# references a URI that has a file modified after the cache manifest.
fileChangedButNotManifest=The file %S was modified after %S. Unless the text in the manifest file is changed the cached version will be used instead at line %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (cacheControlNoStore): Used when an attempt is made to
# validate a page using AppCacheUtils.jsm that has a header preventing caching
# or storing information.
cacheControlNoStore=%S has cache-control set to no-store. This will prevent the application cache from storing the file at line %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (notAvailable): Used when an attempt is made to validate a
# page using AppCacheUtils.jsm that is not available.
notAvailable=%S points to a resource that is not available at line %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (invalidURI): Used when an invalid URI is passed to the
# appcache.
invalidURI=The URI passed to AppCacheUtils is invalid.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (noResults) Used when a search returns no results.
noResults=Your search returned no results.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (cacheDisabled) Used when the cache is disabled and an
# attempt is made to view offline data.
cacheDisabled=Your disk cache is disabled. Please set browser.cache.disk.enable to true in about:config and try again.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (firstLineMustBeCacheManifest): Used when an attempt is made
# to validate a cache manifest using AppCacheUtils.jsm having a first line that
# is not "CACHE MANIFEST."
firstLineMustBeCacheManifest=The first line of the manifest must be "CACHE MANIFEST" at line %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (cacheManifestOnlyFirstLine): Used when an attempt is made
# to validate a cache manifest using AppCacheUtils.jsm having "CACHE MANIFEST"
# on a line other than the first line.
cacheManifestOnlyFirstLine="CACHE MANIFEST" is only valid on the first line at line %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (asteriskInWrongSection): Used when an attempt is made
# to validate a cache manifest using AppCacheUtils.jsm having an asterisk (*) in
# a section other than the network section.
asteriskInWrongSection=Asterisk used as a wildcard in the %S section at line %S. A single line containing an asterisk is called the online whitelist wildcard flag and is only valid in the NETWORK section. Other uses of the * character are prohibited. The presence of this flag indicates that any URI not listed as cached is to be implicitly treated as being in the online whitelist namespaces. If the flag is not present then the blocking state indicates that URIs not listed explicitly in the manifest are to be treated as unavailable.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (escapeSpaces): Used when an attempt is made to validate a
# cache manifest using AppCacheUtils.jsm having a space in a URI. Spaces are to
# be replaced with %20.
escapeSpaces=Spaces in URIs need to be replaced with %20 at line %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (slashDotDotSlashBad): Used when an attempt is made to
# validate a cache manifest using AppCacheUtils.jsm having a URI containing
# /../, which is invalid.
slashDotDotSlashBad=/../ is not a valid URI prefix at line %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (tooManyDotDotSlashes): Used when an attempt is made to
# validate a cache manifest using AppCacheUtils.jsm having a URI containing
# too many ../ operators. Too many of these operaters mean that the file would
# be below the root of the site, which is not possible.
tooManyDotDotSlashes=Too many dot dot slash operators (../) at line %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (fallbackUseSpaces): Used when an attempt is made to
# validate a cache manifest using AppCacheUtils.jsm having a FALLBACK section
# containing more or less than the standard two URIs seperated by a single
# space.
fallbackUseSpaces=Only two URIs separated by spaces are allowed in the FALLBACK section at line %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (fallbackAsterisk): Used when an attempt is made to validate
# a cache manifest using AppCacheUtils.jsm having a FALLBACK section that
# attempts to use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard. In this section the URI is
# simply a path prefix.
fallbackAsterisk=Asterisk (*) incorrectly used as a wildcard in a fallback namespace at line %S. Namespaces simply need to match a path prefix.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (settingsBadValue): Used when an attempt is made to validate
# a cache manifest using AppCacheUtils.jsm having a SETTINGS section containing
# something other than the valid "prefer-online" or "fast."
settingsBadValue=The SETTINGS section may only contain a single value, "prefer-online" or "fast" at line %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (invalidSectionName): Used when an attempt is made to
# validate a cache manifest using AppCacheUtils.jsm containing an invalid
# section name.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (entryNotFound): Used when an attempt is made to view a
# cache entry that does not exist.
