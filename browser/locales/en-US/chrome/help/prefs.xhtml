<h2 id="general_options">General Options</h2>

	<p><img width="425" height="353" alt="General Options Dialog" src="http://mozilla.org/projects/firefox/help/0.9/opt_general.png"/></p>
	<h3 id="home_page">Home Page</h3>
	<p>Specify the page or tab group that &brandShortName; will display after it is opened
	  or when the Home button is clicked. Enter the address in the Location field.</p>

	<p>Click <em>Use Current Page(s)</em> to use the page you're currently visiting.
	  You can also use <strong>multiple home pages</strong>. If more than one browser
	  tab is currently opened, this button will set the <strong>whole tab group</strong>
	  as home page.</p>

	<p>To specify the home page(s) using a bookmark, click <em>Use Bookmark....</em> You can
	  even select a whole bookmark folder to use as multiple home pages!</p>

	<p>If you don't want a home page to be loaded, click <em>Use Blank Page</em>.</p>

    <h3 id="fonts_and_colors">Fonts &amp; Colors</h3>
    <p>Click the <em>Fonts &amp; Colors...</em> button to change the default fonts and colors
    used by &brandShortName;.</p>

    <p><strong>Fonts for:</strong><br/>
      Normally, web pages are displayed in the default font set by &brandShortName; or in a font
      chosen by the web page's author. To change the default fonts:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>From the <em>Fonts for</em> drop-down list, choose a character set. For instance,
        to set default fonts for the Western (Roman) character set, choose <em>Western</em>.</li>
      <li>Select whether proportional text should be serif (like &quot;Times New Roman&quot;) or
        sans-serif (like &quot;Arial&quot;). Then specify the font size you want for
        proportional text.</li>
      <li>Specify the font to use for serif, sans-serif and <em>monospace</em> fonts. You
        can also change the size for monospace fonts.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can also specify the display resolution (normally 96dpi) by selecting
      <em>Other...</em> in the drop-down list of resolutions.</p>

    <p>Finally, you can set the minimum font size to be used on screen. This can be useful on
      sites that use very small or unreadable fonts.</p>

    <p><strong>Text and Background</strong><br/>
    Here you can change the default text and background color to be used on Web pages that haven't
      specified that information. Click on the color samples to select colors.</p>

    <p><em>Use system colors</em><br/>
      Check this option to use the colors defined in your OS settings instead of the colors specified
      above.</p>

    <p><strong>Link Colors</strong><br/>
    Here you can change the default colors for Web links. Click on the color samples to select
      colors.</p>

    <p><em>Underline links</em><br/>
      By default &brandShortName; underlines all links. Uncheck this option to prevent link
      underlining. Note that many sites specify their own link styling rules; this option has
      no effect on those sites.</p>

    <p><strong>Always use my:</strong><br/>
    <em>Fonts</em><br/>
      By default &brandShortName; uses the fonts specified by the Web page author. Enabling this
      option will force all sites to use your default fonts instead.</p>

    <p><em>Colors</em><br/>
      By default, &brandShortName; uses the colors specified by the Web page author. Enabling
      this option will force all sites to use your default colors instead.</p>

    <h3 id="default_browser">Default Browser</h3>
    <p>On Windows you can set &brandShortName; as the default browser by clicking <em>Set
      Default Browser</em>. This will ensure &brandShortName; is used whenever an application
      tries to display a Web site or when you open an HTML file. This feature has no effect
      on Linux or Macintosh.</p>

    <h3 id="connection_settings">Connection Settings</h3>
    <p>Many organizations block access from the Internet to their networks. This prevents outside
      parties from gaining access to sensitive information. This protection is called a firewall.</p>

    <p>If your organization has a firewall, &brandShortName; may need to go through a proxy server
      before connecting you to the Internet. The proxy server prevents outsiders from breaking
      into your organization's private network.</p>

    <strong>Configure Proxies to Access the Internet</strong>

    <dl>
      <dt>Direct connection to the Internet</dt>
      <dd>This is the default option. Choose this if you don't want to use a proxy.</dd>

      <dt>Manual proxy configuration</dt>
      <dd>Choose this if you don't have a proxy location (URL). Ask your system administrator
        for the names and port numbers of the servers running proxy software for each network
	service and enter the information in the appropriate fields.</dd>

      <dt>Automatic proxy configuration URL</dt>
      <dd>If your workplace has a proxy configuration file, ask the system administrator
        for its URL and enter it here. Click <em>Reload</em> to load the settings.</dd>
    </dl>

<h2 id="privacy_options">Privacy Options</h2>

  <p><img width="425" height="353" alt="Privacy Options Dialog" src="http://mozilla.org/projects/firefox/help/0.9/opt_privacy.png"/></p>

  <p>The Privacy panel contains options related to your privacy. As you browse the web &brandShortName;
    stores information on where you have been, what pages you have visited, and other browsing statistics.
    Click the <em>Clear</em> button on each section to clear that information. Alternatively you can
    clear all information stored while browsing by clicking <em>Clear All</em>. A confirmation dialog
    will be shown before the information is cleared.</p>

  <p>To display section-specific options, expand a section by clicking on the small + button.</p>

  <h3 id="history">History</h3>
  <p>Here you can specify how long you want &brandShortName; to remember what pages you have
    visited. The default is 9 days.</p>

  <h3 id="saved_form_information">Saved Form Information</h3>
  <p><em>Save information I enter in web page forms and the Search bar</em><br/>When you enter
    information in web forms, &brandShortName; remembers what you type and automatically makes
    suggestions when you enter information again. To stop this behavior, uncheck this option.</p>

  <h3 id="saved_passwords">Saved Passwords</h3>
  <p><em>Remember Passwords</em><br/>&brandShortName; is capable of securely storing passwords you
    enter in web forms to make it easier to log on to Web sites. You can manage the saved passwords
    and delete individual passwords by clicking <em>View Saved Passwords</em>. To stop saving passwords
    alltogether, uncheck this option.</p>

  <h3 id="download_manager_history">Download Manager History</h3>
  <p>The Download Manager (accessible from <span class="menuPath">Tools</span> or by pressing
    <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd>) stores shortcuts to your recent downloads. The Download options
    are available in the <strong>Downloads panel</strong>.</p>

  <h3 id="cookies">Cookies</h3>
  <p>A cookie is a file created by a Web site that stores information on your computer, such as
    your preferences when visiting that site.</p>

  <p>Learn more about cookies and how you can gain control over what sites are allowed to store
    cookies on your computer by reading about <a href="cookies.xhtml">Managing
    Cookies</a>.</p>

  <p>To display the Cookie Manager click <em>Stored Cookies</em>.</p>

  <p><em>Enable Cookies</em><br/>By default cookies are enabled. Uncheck this option to disable
    the use of cookies. Note that some sites may not work properly when cookies are disabled.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>for the originating Web site only</dt>
    <dd>Selecting this option will restrict cookie usage to the originating Web site only,
      meaning that no foreign cookies will be stored. To learn more about this, read about
      <a href="cookies.xhtml">managing cookies</a>.</dd>

    <dt>for the current session only</dt>
    <dd>If this option is selected, cookie information will be removed when you restart
      &brandShortName;. Web sites requiring the use of cookies will still work, but if you restart
      &brandShortName;, the Web site will think that you logged into the site for the first time
      again.</dd>

    <dt>but ask before accepting</dt>
    <dd>When this option is enabled, a confirmation dialog will be displayed each time
      a site tries to save a cookie on your computer.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3 id="cache">Cache</h3>
  <p>Pages you view are normally stored in a special cache folder for quicker viewing the next
    time you visit the same page. You can specify the amount of disk space the cache can use
    here.</p>

<h2 id="web_features_options">Web Features Options</h2>

  <p><img width="425" height="350" alt="Web Features Options Dialog" src="http://mozilla.org/projects/firefox/help/0.9/opt_webfeatures.png"/></p>

  <p><em>Block Popup Windows</em><br/>By default, &brandShortName; blocks annoying popup windows
    on Web sites. Unchecking this option will disable popup blocking.</p>

  <p>Some sites make legitimate use of popup windows. Therefore, the popup blocking feature has
    a simple whitelist mechanism to allow certain sites to open popups anyway. To add a site to
    the whitelist, click <em>Add Site...</em>.</p>

  <p> To remove a site from the whitelist, select that site from the list and then click
    <em>Remove Site</em>. To clear the whitelist completely, click <em>Remove All Sites</em>.</p>

  <p><em>Enable Java</em><br/>Java is a popular programming language for the web developed by
    Sun Microsystems. A single Java program can run on many different kinds of computers, thus
    avoiding the need for programmers to create a separate version of each program for each
    kind of computer. Uncheck this option to disable Java applets in &brandShortName;. Note
    that in order for Java applets to work, you must install the Java plugin.</p>

  <p><em>Enable JavaScript</em><br/>JavaScript is a scripting language commonly used to
    construct web pages. JavaScript is often used to dynamically validate forms and select
    buttons. Disabling JavaScript may cause some sites to not work properly.</p>

  <p>While it is usually recommended to keep JavaScript enabled, there are some functions that
    you may want to disable. Click the <em>Advanced...</em> button to display these options.</p>

  <h3 id="allow_scripts_to">Allow scripts to:</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>Move or resize existing windows</dt>
    <dd>Uncheck this option to disable moving and resizing windows using scripts.</dd>

    <dt>Raise or lower windows</dt>
    <dd>Uncheck this option to make sure scripts cannot raise or lower windows.</dd>

    <dt>Hide the status bar</dt>
    <dd>Uncheck this option to force the status bar to be displayed in popup windows.</dd>

    <dt>Change status bar text</dt>
    <dd>Uncheck this option to disable annoying status bar text scrolling and Web
      address hiding.</dd>

    <dt>Change images</dt>
    <dd>Uncheck this option to disable changing of images. Disabling this can make
      some menus harder to navigate.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p><em>Load Images</em><br/>By default images are loaded on Web pages. Uncheck this
    option to disable images completely. If images are loaded, you can still specify not
    to load images from certain sites by clicking <em>Permissions...</em>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>for the originating Web site only</em><br/>Enabling this option will make
      sure that only images located at the current Web site are loaded.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Image Manager window lists all servers for which you are currently blocking images.
    To block a server (often an advertising server), right click on an image on
    a Web page and select <em>Block Images from &lt;server&gt;</em>. To unblock a site, select
    that server from the Image Manager and click <em>Remove Site</em>. To unblock all sites
    so all images are shown, click <em>Remove All Sites</em>.</p>

<h2 id="downloads_options">Downloads Options</h2>

  <p><img src="http://mozilla.org/projects/firefox/help/0.9/opt_downloads.png" width="425" height="353" alt="Downloads Options Dialog"/></p>

  <p>This panel controls how &brandShortName; handles different file types such as applications,
    compressed files, and multimedia files.</p>

  <h3 id="download_folder">Download Folder</h3>

  <p><em>Ask me where to save every file</em><br/>This is the default option. &brandShortName;
    will ask you where you want the file to be saved whenever you download a file.</p>

  <p><em>Save all files to this folder:</em><br/>Alternatively, you can specify a default folder
    where all downloads will be saved, such as the &quot;My Downloads&quot; folder. You can browse to a
    specific folder by selecting <em>Other...</em> from the drop-down list of available folders. To show
    the folder, click the <em>Show Folder</em> button. This will open the folder in the default file
    manager.</p>

  <h3 id="file_types">File Types</h3>

  <p>This list contains file types that you have downloaded. You can choose what &brandShortName;
    should do when clicking on a specific file type. Select the file type you want to modify and
    click the <em>Change Action...</em> button.</p>

  <p>This will display the Change Action window, where you can choose to have the file type opened
    by an application or saved to disk. For example, if you view lots of media files on Web
    pages, you might want to specify that &brandShortName; always open media files in your media
    player instead of asking where you want each media file to be saved.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Open them in the Default application:</em><br/>Select this option to open this file type
      in the default application for that file type (determined by the operating system).</li>
    <li><em>Open them in this application:</em><br/>Select this option to specify another application
      that should handle this file type. You will see a dialog asking you to specify the application
      to use.</li>
    <li><em>Save to Disk</em><br/>This option will save the files to disk. If you have the <em>Save
      all files to this folder</em> option selected, the files will be saved automatically.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To remove an automatic rule for a file type, select that file type and click the <em>Remove</em>
    button.</p>
  <p>From the Downloads panel, you can also control the plug-ins for &brandShortName;. Click the
    <em>Plug-Ins...</em> button to display the Plug-Ins window:</p>

  <p>From this window, you can control which plug-ins for &brandShortName; can run. For example, if
    you don't like Flash animations in general but still find a need to have the plug-in installed,
    you can disable the plug-in here. This will block any Flash ads and animations until you enable
    the plug-in again.</p>

<h2 id="themes_options">Themes Options</h2>

  <p><img width="425" height="350" alt="Themes Options Window" src="http://mozilla.org/projects/firefox/help/0.9/opt_themes.png"/></p>

  <p>Switch themes and uninstall existing themes in this panel. Select a theme from the
    list and click <em>OK</em> to switch to that theme.</p>
  <p>To download more themes, click on the <em>Get New Themes</em> link.</p>
  <p>To uninstall a theme, select it and click <em>Uninstall Theme</em>. (Note that you can't uninstall
    the currently loaded theme or the built-in default theme.  You also can't uninstall Modern if it
    exists in the themes list.)</p>

<h2 id="extensions_options">Extensions Options</h2>

  <p><img width="425" height="350" alt="Extensions Options Window" src="http://mozilla.org/projects/firefox/help/0.9/opt_extensions.png"/></p>

  <p>You can enable, disable, or change settings for installed extensions in this panel. To install
    extensions, click on the <em>Get New Extensions</em> link.</p>

  <p>Some extensions offer the ability to change settings. To change settings for an extension, select
    it and click <em>Settings</em>. This button is disabled if there are no settings for the selected
    extension.</p>

  <p>To disable an extension, select it and click <em>Disable Extension</em>. You can't uninstall an
    extension yet. This is planned in a future release of &brandShortName;.</p>

<h2 id="advanced_options">Advanced Options</h2>

  <p><img src="http://mozilla.org/projects/firefox/help/0.9/opt_advanced.png" width="425" height="353" alt="Advanced Options window"/></p>

  <p>The advanced panel contains many options that are less likely to be used by most people but are still
    useful and sometimes critical options for some.</p>

  <h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>
  <p><em>Move system caret with focus/selection changes</em><br/>Specifies whether to move the system
    caret whenever the focus or selection changes. Some accessibility aids, such as screen readers and
    screen magnifiers, use the system caret to determine which area of the screen to read or magnify.</p>

  <p><em>Use Find As You Type</em><br/>Find As You Type is a very useful feature in &brandShortName;.
    It is a fast way of finding links or text in a Web page without the need of displaying complex
    search dialogs. Read more about Find As You Type at
    <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/ui/accessibility/typeaheadfind.html">mozilla.org</a>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>to search links only</em><br/>By default Find As You Type only searches text withing Web
      links. Uncheck this option to make Find As You Type search plain text as well.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="browsing">Browsing</h3>

  <p><em>Hide the tab bar when only one Web site is open</em><br/>If you're only viewing one Web page
    in a &brandShortName; window, the tab bar is not shown. Uncheck this option to always show the tab
    bar.</p>

  <p><em>Select new tabs opened from links</em><br/>When you middle-click on Web links (or hold down
    <em>Ctrl</em>  while clicking with the left mouse button), the links will be opened in a
    new tab. That tab will not be shown directly; it will be loaded in a background tab.
    Check this option to load the link in a foreground tab instead, which will show that tab
    directly.</p>

  <p><em>Warn when closing multiple tabs</em><br/>When you close a window with
    multiple tabs, &brandShortName; will ask you to confirm your choice.  This
    prevents you from accidentally closing the whole window when you wish to
    close only the current tab.  Uncheck this box to skip past the warning
    and have &brandShortName; automatically close the window.</p>

  <p><em>Use autoscrolling</em><br/>Autoscrolling is a useful feature which allows you to scroll
    the page by just holding down the middle mouse button (usually the scroll wheel) and move the
    mouse up or down. Some people find this annoying so here's the option for it.</p>

  <p><em>Use smooth scrolling</em><br/>Smooth scrolling is still somewhat experimental in
    &brandShortName;, but it can be very useful if you read a lot of long pages. Normally, when you
    press the Page Down key, the view jumps directly down one page. With Smooth Scrolling, it
    slides down more smoothly, so you are actually able to see how much it scrolls. This makes it
    easier to resume reading from where you were before.</p>

  <h3 id="multimedia">Multimedia</h3>

  <p><em>Resize large images to fit in the &brandShortName; window</em><br/>This feature is similar
    to the one seen in Internet Explorer. It makes images that are larger than can be fit on the
    screen shrink automatically so you can view the whole picture. Click on the image to view it at
    full size.</p>

  <h3 id="security">Security</h3>

  <p><em>Use SSL 2.0</em><br/>Specifies whether you want to send and receive secured information
    through SSL2 (Secured Sockets Layer Level 2), the standard protocol for secure transmissions.
    All secure Web sites support this protocol.</p>

  <p><em>Use SSL 3.0</em><br/>Specifies whether you want to send and receive secured information
    through SSL3 (Secured Sockets Layer Level 3), a protocol that is intended to be more secure
    than SSL2. Note that some Web sites may not support this protocol.</p>

  <p><em>Use TLS 1.0</em><br/>Specifies whether you want to send and receive secured information
    through TLS (Transport Layer Security), an open security standard similar to SSL3 (Secure
    Sockets Layer). Note that some Web sites may not support this protocol.</p>

  <h3 id="certificates">Certificates</h3>

  <p>The Certificates section is provisional and will be changed or removed in future releases.
  It is not covered in this document.</p>

  <h3 id="validation">Validation</h3>

  <p>The Validation section is provisional and will be changed or removed in future releases.
  It is not covered in this document.</p>
