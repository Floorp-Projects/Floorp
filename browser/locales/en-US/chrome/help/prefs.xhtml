<h2 id="general_options">General &pref.pluralCaps;</h2>

  <h3 id="home_page">Home Page</h3>

    <p>Here you can specify the page (or tab group) that
      &brandShortName; will show when you launch it or press the Home button.
      Enter the address in the Location(s) field.</p>

    <p>Click <em>Use Current Page(s)</em> to use the page you're currently
      visiting. You can also use <strong>multiple home pages</strong>. If more
      than one browser tab is currently opened, this button will set the
      <strong>whole tab group</strong> as a start page.</p>

    <p>To specify the home page(s) using a bookmark, click <em>Use
      Bookmark...</em>. Selecting a whole bookmark folder will load all the
      bookmarks inside it in tabs.</p>

    <p>If you don't want a home page to be loaded, click <em>Use Blank
      Page</em>.</p>

  <h3 id="default_browser">Default Browser</h3>
    <p><em>&brandShortName; should check to see if it is the default
      browser when starting</em><br/>
      Check this option if you want &brandShortName; to check whether it is the
      default browser when starting. This will ensure &brandShortName; is used
      whenever an application tries to display a web page or when you open
      an HTML file. You can also click the <em>Check Now</em> button to do a
      check right now.</p>

  <h3 id="connection_settings">Connection Settings</h3>

    <p>Your organization or Internet service provider may offer or require you
      to use a proxy. A proxy acts as an intermediary between your computer and
      the Internet. It intercepts all requests to the Internet to see if it can
      fulfill the request using its cache. Proxies are used to improve
      performance, filter requests, and hide your computer from the Internet to
      improve security. Proxies are often part of a corporate firewall.</p>

    <h4>Connection Settings dialog:</h4>
      <dl>
        <dt>Direct connection to the Internet</dt>
        <dd>This is the default &pref.singular;. Choose this if you don't want
          to use a proxy.</dd>

        <dt>Auto-detect proxy settings for this network</dt>
        <dd>Choose this if you want &brandShortName; to automatically detect the
          proxy settings for your network.</dd>

        <dt>Manual proxy configuration</dt>
        <dd>Choose this if you don't have a proxy location (URL). Ask your
          system administrator for the names and port numbers of the servers
          running proxy software for each network service and enter the
          information in the appropriate fields.</dd>

        <dt>Automatic proxy configuration URL</dt>
        <dd>If your workplace has a proxy configuration file, ask the system
          administrator for its URL and enter it here. Click <em>Reload</em> to
          load the settings.</dd>
      </dl>

<h2 id="privacy_options">Privacy &pref.pluralCaps;</h2>

  <p>The Privacy panel contains &pref.plural; related to your privacy. As you
    browse the web, information on where you have been, what pages you have
    visited, etc. are stored here. You can click the corresponding
    <em>Clear</em> button on each but the Passwords tab to clear that
    information. If you really want to delete all your Passwords at once, click
    <em>View Saved Passwords</em> and then click the <em>Remove All</em> button
    in the Password Manager dialog.</p>

  <h3 id="sanitize">Sanitize Settings</h3>
  <p>&brandShortName; also allows you to clear certain or all items by pressing
    &accelKey;+&shiftKey;+<kbd>Del</kbd> or selecting <span class="menuPath">
    Tools &gt; Sanitize &brandShortName;...</span>. You can also change the
    &pref.singular; to make &brandShortName; clear your data when you close
    &brandShortName;. &pref.pluralCaps; for this are in the <em>Sanitize
    &brandShortName;...</em> dialog.</p>

  <p>To display section-specific &pref.plural;, display a section by clicking on
    its tab.</p>

  <h3 id="privacy_history">History</h3>
    <p>Here you can specify how long you want &brandShortName; to remember what
      pages you have visited. The default is 9 days.</p>

  <h3 id="privacy_saved_forms">Saved Forms</h3>
    <p><em>Save information I enter in forms and the Search bar</em><br/>
      When you enter information in web forms, &brandShortName;
      remembers what you type and automatically makes suggestions when you enter
      information again. To stop this behavior, uncheck this &pref.singular;.</p>

  <h3 id="privacy_passwords">Passwords</h3>
    <p><em>Remember Passwords</em><br/>
      &brandShortName; can securely save passwords you enter in web forms to
      make it easier to log on to web sites. Clear this checkbox to prevent
      &brandShortName; from remembering your passwords.</p>

    <p id="set_change_master_password"><em>Set/Change Master Password...</em><br/>
      &brandShortName; can protect sensitive information such as saved passwords
      and certificates. If you create a Master Password, &brandShortName; will ask
      you to enter it once per session as soon as it is needed. You can set or
      change the master password by clicking this button.</p>

    <p id="remove_master_password"><em>Remove Master Password...</em><br/>
      Click this button to remove your current master password. You will have to
      enter your current master password to do this.</p>

    <p><em>View Saved Passwords</em><br/>
      You can manage saved passwords and delete individual passwords by clicking
      the <em>View Saved Passwords</em> button.</p>

  <h3 id="privacy_download_history">Download History</h3>
    <p>The Download Manager (accessible from <span class="menuPath">Tools</span>,
      by pressing
      <span class="noUnix">&accelKey;+<kbd>J</kbd></span><span class="unix">&accelKey;+<kbd>Y</kbd></span>,
      or by clicking the <em>View Download History</em> button)
      stores shortcuts to your recent downloads. The Downloads &pref.plural; are
      available in the <strong>Downloads panel</strong>.</p>

    <p><em>Remove files from the Download Manager:</em><br/>
      Choose whether the list of the recently downloaded files is purged <em>upon
      successful download</em>, or <em>when &brandShortName; exits</em>, or
      whether you want to purge the list <em>manually</em>. To purge the list,
      click the <em>Clear Download History Now</em> button below or the
      <em>Clean Up</em> button in the Download Manager.</p>

  <h3 id="privacy_cookies">Cookies</h3>
    <p>A cookie is a file created by a web site that stores information on your
      computer, such as your preferences when visiting that site.</p>

    <p><em>Allow sites to set cookies</em><br/>
      By default cookies are enabled. Uncheck this &pref.singular; to disable
      the use of cookies. Note that some sites may not work properly when
      cookies are disabled.</p>

    <p>To display the Cookie Manager click <em>View Cookies</em>.</p>

    <p>Learn more about cookies, the individual &pref.plural;, and how you can
      gain control over what sites are allowed to store cookies on your computer
      by reading about <a href="cookies.xhtml">Managing Cookies</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="privacy_cache">Cache</h3>
    <p>Pages you view are normally stored in a special cache folder for quicker
      viewing the next time you visit the same page. You can specify the amount
      of disk space the cache can use here.</p>

<h2 id="content_options">Content &pref.pluralCaps;</h2>

  <p><em>Block Popup Windows</em><br/>
    By default, &brandShortName; blocks annoying popup windows on web sites.
    Unchecking this &pref.singular; will disable popup blocking.</p>

  <p>Some web sites make legitimate use of popup windows. Therefore, you can
    allow these sites to open popups anyway. To do so, click <em>Allowed
    Sites</em>, enter the site name, and click <em>Allow</em>.</p>

  <p>To remove a web site from the list, select it and then click <em>Remove
    Site</em>. To clear the list completely, click <em>Remove All Sites</em>.</p>

  <p><em>Allow web sites to install software</em><br/>
    By default, web sites are allowed to install software such as extensions
    and themes. However, &brandShortName; will always ask you to confirm
    software installations. Uncheck this &pref.singular; to completely disable
    extension and theme installation.</p>

  <p>Enabling this &pref.singular; is sufficient to install themes. Extensions
    are more powerful than themes, however, so you must explicitly allow a web
    site to install its extensions. To do so, click <em>Allowed Sites</em>,
    enter the site name, and click <em>Allow</em>.</p>

  <p><em>Load Images</em><br/>
    By default images are loaded on web pages. Uncheck this &pref.singular;
    to disable images completely.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>for the originating web site only</em><br/>
      Enabling this &pref.singular; will make sure that only images located at
      the current web site are loaded.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Depending on if you enable images, you can change which sites are
    blocked or which sites can load images by clicking <em>Exceptions</em>.
    Enter the site you want to allow/deny images from and click
    <em>Allow</em> to allow images, or click <em>Block</em> to block the
    images.</p>

  <p><em>Enable Java</em><br/>
    Java is a popular programming language for the web developed by Sun
    Microsystems. A single Java program can run on many different kinds of
    computers, thus avoiding the need for programmers to create a separate
    version of each program for each kind of computer.
    Uncheck this &pref.singular; to disable Java applets in &brandShortName;.
    Note that in order for Java applets to work, you must install the Java
    plugin.</p>

  <p><em>Enable JavaScript</em><br/>
    JavaScript is a scripting language commonly used to construct web pages.
    JavaScript is often used to dynamically validate forms and select buttons.
    Disabling JavaScript may cause some sites to not work properly.</p>

  <h4 id="advanced_javascript">Advanced JavaScript Settings</h4>
  <dl>
    <dt>Move or resize existing windows</dt>
    <dd>Uncheck this &pref.singular; to disable moving and resizing windows using
      scripts.</dd>

    <dt>Raise or lower windows</dt>
    <dd>Uncheck this &pref.singular; to make sure scripts cannot raise or lower
      windows.</dd>

    <dt>Disable or replace context menus</dt>
    <dd>Uncheck this &pref.singular; to prevent web pages from disabling or changing
      the &brandShortName; context menu.</dd>

    <dt>Hide the status bar</dt>
    <dd>Uncheck this &pref.singular; to force the status bar to be displayed in popup
      windows.</dd>

    <dt>Change status bar text</dt>
    <dd>Uncheck this &pref.singular; to disable annoying status bar text scrolling and
      Web address hiding.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3 id="fonts_and_colors">Fonts &amp; Colors</h3>
    <p><em>Default Font</em> and <em>Size</em><br/>
      Web pages are usually displayed in the font and size specified here.
      However, web pages may override these choices unless you specify otherwise
      in the Advanced Fonts dialog.</p>

    <p>Click the <em>Advanced...</em> button to access more fonts &pref.plural;.</p>

    <h4>Advanced Fonts Dialog:</h4>

      <ol>
        <li>From the <em>Fonts for</em> drop-down list, choose a language group/script.
          For instance, to set default fonts for the West European
          languages/scripts (Latin), choose <em>Western</em>. For a
          language/script not yet in the list, choose <em>Other Languages</em>.</li>
        <li>Select whether proportional text should be serif (like &quot;Times
          New Roman&quot;) or sans-serif (like &quot;Arial&quot;). Then specify
          the font size you want for proportional text.</li>
        <li>Specify the font to use for Serif, Sans-serif and Monospace fonts.
          You can also change the size for <code>Monospace fonts</code>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You can also specify the display resolution, which is normally 96
        dpi.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, you can set the minimum font size to be used on screen.
        This can be useful on some sites that use very small fonts that are
        barely readable.</p>

      <p><em>Allow pages to choose their own fonts, instead of my selections
        above</em><br/>
        By default &brandShortName; uses the fonts specified by the web page
        author. Disabling this &pref.singular; will force all sites to use your
        default fonts instead.</p>

      <p><em>Character Encoding</em><br/>
        The character encoding selected here will be used to display pages that
        do not specify which encoding to use.</p>

    <h4>Colors Dialog:</h4>
      <p><strong>Text and Background</strong><br/>
        Here you can change the default text and background color to be used on
        web pages that haven't specified that information. Click on the color
        samples to select colors.</p>

      <p><em>Use system colors</em><br/>
        Check this &pref.singular; to use the colors defined in your OS settings
        instead of the colors specified above.</p>

      <p><strong>Link Colors</strong><br/>
      Here you can change the default colors for Web links. Click on the color
        samples to select colors.</p>

      <p><em>Underline links</em><br/>
        By default, links are underlined on web pages. Uncheck this &pref.singular;
        to disable this. Note that many sites specify their own styling rules
        and this &pref.singular; has no effect on those sites.</p>

      <p><em>Allow pages to choose their own colors, instead of my selections
        above</em><br/>
        By default, &brandShortName; uses the colors specified by the web page
        author. Disabling this &pref.singular; will force all sites to use your
        default colors instead.</p>

<h2 id="tabs_options">Tabs &pref.pluralCaps;</h2>
  <p><em>Open links from other applications in:</em><br/>
    When other applications on your computer display a web page, &brandShortName;
    opens the page in the most recently displayed tab or window. You can make
    &brandShortName; open the page elsewhere by changing this
    &pref.singular;.</p>

  <p><em>Force links that open new windows to open in:</em><br/>
    &brandShortName; opens new windows from links when web pages request them.
    If you prefer to use tabs as you browse, this behavior may be
    counterproductive. You can force &brandShortName; to open links that would
    normally be opened in new windows to be opened elsewhere. To do so, select
    the checkbox for this &pref.singular; and choose the behavior you desire.</p>

  <p><em>Hide the tab bar when only one web site is open</em><br/>
    If you're only viewing one web page in a &brandShortName; window, the tab
    bar is not shown. Uncheck this &pref.singular; to always show the tab bar.</p>

  <p><em>Select new tabs opened from links</em><br/>
    When you middle-click on Web links (or hold down &accelKey; while clicking
    with the left mouse button), the links will be opened in a new tab. That tab
    will not be shown directly; it will be loaded in a background tab. Check
    this &pref.singular; to load the link in a foreground tab instead, which
    will show that tab directly.</p>

  <p><em>Warn when closing multiple tabs</em><br/>
    When you close a window with multiple tabs, &brandShortName; will ask you to
    confirm your choice. This prevents you from accidentally closing the whole
    window when you wish to close only the current tab. Uncheck this box to skip
    past the warning and have &brandShortName; automatically close the window.</p>

<h2 id="downloads_options">Downloads &pref.pluralCaps;</h2>

  <p>This panel controls how &brandShortName; handles different file types
    such as applications, compressed files, and multimedia files.</p>

  <h3 id="download_folder">Download Folder</h3>
    <p><em>Ask me where to save every file</em><br/>
      &brandShortName; will ask you where you want the file to be saved whenever
      you download a file.</p>

    <p><em>Save all files to this folder:</em><br/>
      This is the default &pref.singular; in &brandShortName;, and the default
      folder is the Desktop. You can specify a different folder where all
      downloads will be saved by clicking the <em>Browse</em> button.</p>

  <h3 id="download_manager">Download Manager</h3>
    <p><em>Show Download Manager when a download begins</em><br/>
      Select whether or not you want the Download Manager to automatically
      appear when a download begins.</p>

    <p><em>Close the download manager when all downloads are complete</em><br/>
      Select whether or not you want the Download Manager to be closed when all
      downloads are complete.</p>

  <h3 id="download_actions">Download Actions</h3>
    <p>The Download Actions dialog, which can be opened by clicking the <em>View
      &amp; Edit Actions...</em> button, contains file types that you have
      downloaded. You can choose what &brandShortName; should do when clicking
      on a specific file type by selecting the file type you want to modify and
      clicking the <em>Change Action...</em> button.</p>

    <p>This will display the Change Action dialog, where you can choose to have
      the file type opened by the default application, opened by a user-selected
      application, saved to disk, or shown with an installed plugin. For
      example, if you view lots of media files on web pages, you might want to
      specify that &brandShortName; always open media files in your media player
      instead of asking where you want each media file to be saved.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Open them with the default application:</em><br/>
        Select this &pref.singular; to open this file type in the default
        application for that file type (determined by the operating system).</li>
      <li><em>Open them with this application:</em><br/>
        Select this &pref.singular; to specify another application that should
        handle this file type. You will see a dialog asking you to specify the
        application to use.</li>
      <li><em>Save them on my computer:</em><br/>
        This &pref.singular; will save the files to disk. If you have the
        <em>Save all files to this folder</em> &pref.singular; enabled, the files
        will be saved automatically.</li>
      <li><em>Use this Plugin:</em><br/>
        Select this &pref.singular; to let a plugin handle this file type.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To remove an automatic rule for a file type, select that file type in the
      Download Actions dialog and click the <em>Remove Action</em> button.</p>

<h2 id="advanced_options">Advanced &pref.pluralCaps;</h2>
  <p>The advanced panel contains many &pref.plural; that are less likely to be
      used by most people but are still useful and sometimes critical &pref.plural;
      for some people.</p>

  <h3 id="advanced_general">General tab</h3>

    <h4 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h4>
      <p><em>Allow text to be selected with the keyboard</em><br/>
        Also known as Caret Browsing, this specifies whether a moveable cursor
        is displayed, allowing you to select text with the keyboard. Some
        accessibility aids, such as screen readers and screen magnifiers, use
        the system caret to determine which area of the screen to read or
        magnify. You can toggle this mode by pressing <kbd>F7</kbd>.</p>

      <p><em>Begin finding when you begin typing</em><br/>
        When this &pref.singular; is enabled, &brandShortName; will find within
        the current web page what you type as you type it. While you are finding
        typed text in the page, the Find Toolbar will automatically display at
        the bottom of the window to show information about what you've found.</p>

    <h4 id="browsing">Browsing</h4>
      <p><em>Resize large images to fit in the browser window</em><br/>
        This feature is similar to the one seen in Internet Explorer. It makes
        images that are larger than can be fit on the screen shrink automatically
        so you can view the whole picture. Click on the image to view it at full
        size.</p>

      <p><em>Use autoscrolling</em><br/>
        Autoscrolling is a useful feature which allows you to scroll the page by
        just holding down the middle mouse button (usually the scroll wheel) and
        move the mouse up or down. Some people find this annoying, so
        autoscrolling can be disabled with this &pref.singular;.</p>

      <p><em>Use smooth scrolling</em><br/>
        Smooth scrolling can be very useful if you read a lot of long pages.
        Normally, when you press <kbd>Page Down</kbd>, the view jumps directly
        down one page. With smooth scrolling, it slides down more smoothly, so
        you can see how much it scrolls. This makes it easier to resume reading
        from where you were before.</p>

    <h4 id="languages">Languages</h4>

      <p>Some web pages are offered in more than one language. Click the
        <em>Edit Languages...</em> button to specify your preferred
        languages.</p>

      <p><strong>Languages Dialog:</strong><br/>
        To add a language, press <em>Select a language to add...</em>, choose
        the language, and click the <em>Add</em> button. Remove a language by
        selecting it in the list of active languages and clicking the
        <em>Remove</em> button.</p>

      <p>You can reorder languages to determine the preferred one in case a page
        is provided in two or more of your selected languages. Do this using the
        <em>Move Up</em> and <em>Move Down</em> buttons.</p>

  <h3 id="advanced_update">Update tab</h3>
    <p>&brandShortName; can check whether updates to installed
      extensions, themes, or &brandShortName; itself are available.</p>

    <p><em>Automatically check for updates to:</em><br/>
      By default &brandShortName; automatically checks for updates to itself,
      to extensions and themes, and to search engines so you'll always know you
      have the most up-to-date version. You can turn off this behavior by
      unchecking the appropriate checkbox here. You can also manually check for
      updates to either &brandShortName; or your installed extensions and themes
      by clicking the corresponding <em>Check Now...</em> button.</p>

    <p><em>When updates to &brandShortName; are found,</em></p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Ask me what I want to do</dt>
      <dd>Updates to &brandShortName; are typically installed automatically by
        default.  Select this &pref.singular; to manually control how and when
        updates are installed.</dd>
      <dt>Automatically download and install the update</dt>
      <dd>When this &pref.singular; is selected, &brandShortName; updates will
        be automatically downloaded and will be installed the next time
        &brandShortName; is restarted.  The <em>Warn me if this will disable
        extensions or themes</em> &pref.singular; determines whether you will be
        warned before the installation of an update which would require an
        incompatible extension or theme to be disabled because no newer,
        compatible version exists.  The warning will allow you to postpone
        installation of the update, though at the expense of improvements
        included in it.</dd>
      <dd>If all extensions and themes are compatible or can be updated to 
        be compatible, the &brandShortName; update will be installed.  Upon
        restart you will be asked to install any needed extension and
        theme updates so that you can continue to use them.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p><em>Show Update History</em><br/>
      &brandShortName; automatically records the updates you have installed.
      You can view information about these updates by clicking this button.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong>  You must be running &brandShortName; as
      <span class="win">an administrator</span><span class="noWin">root</span>
      or as the user who originally installed &brandShortName;
      to install &brandShortName; updates.</p>

  <h3 id="advanced_security">Security tab</h3>
    <h4 id="protocols">Protocols</h4>
      <p><em>Use SSL 2.0</em><br/>
        Specifies whether you want to send and receive secured information
        through SSL2 (Secure Sockets Layer Level 2), the standard protocol for
        secure transmissions. All secure web sites support this protocol.</p>

      <p><em>Use SSL 3.0</em><br/>
        Specifies whether you want to send and receive secured information
        through SSL3 (Secure Sockets Layer Level 3), a protocol that is intended
        to be more secure than SSL2. Note that some web sites may not support
        this protocol.</p>

      <p><em>Use TLS 1.0</em><br/>
        Specifies whether you want to send and receive secured information
        through TLS (Transport Layer Security), an open security standard
        similar to SSL3 (Secure Sockets Layer). Note that some web sites may not
        support this protocol.</p>

    <h4 id="certificates">Certificates</h4>
      <p>Certificates help perform encryption and decryption of connections to
        <a href="glossary.xhtml#secure_site">secure sites</a>.</p>

      <p><em>When a web site requires a certificate:</em><br/>
        When a web site requests a secure connection, &brandShortName; will by
        default automatically use an appropriate certificate. If you wish to
        manually choose a certificate (for example, if you wish to use a certain
        type of encryption instead of what is automatically selected), select
        the &pref.singular; <em>Ask me every time</em> and you'll be in complete
        control of what certificates you use while browsing.</p>

      <p><em>View Certificates</em><br/>
        Click this button to view stored certificates, import new certificates,
        and back up or delete old certificates in &brandShortName;.</p>

      <p><em>Revocation Lists</em><br/>
        &brandShortName; can use Certificate Revocation Lists (also known as
        CRLs) to ensure that your certificates are not invalid. Click the
        <em>Revocation Lists</em> button to manage the CRLs installed on your
        computer.</p>

      <p><em>Verification</em><br/>
        OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) is a way to validate your
        certificates every time they are viewed or used. &brandShortName; does
        not use OCSP by default, but if you want to enable it, you can do so
        here. You will most likely only need to change this if your Internet
        environment requires it.</p>

      <p><em>Security Devices</em><br/>
        Security devices can encrypt and decrypt connections and store
        certificates and passwords. If you need to use a security device other
        than the one in &brandShortName;, click the <em>Security Devices</em>
        button.</p>
