# LOCALIZATION NOTE:

# This file must be saved as UTF8

# Do not replace $BrandShortName, $BrandProductName, $BrandFullName,
# or $BrandFullNameDA with a custom string and always use the same one as used
# by the en-US files.
# $BrandFullNameDA allows the string to contain an ampersand (e.g. DA stands
# for double ampersand) and prevents the letter following the ampersand from
# being used as an accesskey.

# You can use \n to create a newline in the string but only when the string
# from en-US contains a \n.
