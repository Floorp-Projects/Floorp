# LOCALIZATION NOTE:

# This file must be saved as UTF8

# Accesskeys are defined by prefixing the letter that is to be used for the
# accesskey with an ampersand (e.g. &).

# Do not replace $(^NameDA) or $(^Name) with a custom string.

# Do not change $(^NameDA) to $(^Name) or $(^Name) to $(^NameDA). NameDA allows
# Name to contain an ampersand (e.g. DA stands for double ampersand) and
# prevents the letter following the ampersand being used as an accesskey.

# You can use \n to create a newline in the string but only when the string
# from en-US contains a \n.

# Strings that require a space at the end should be enclosed with double
# quotes and the double quotes will be removed. To add quotes to the beginning
# and end of a strong enclose the add and additional double quote to the
# beginning and end of the string (e.g. ""This will include quotes"").
