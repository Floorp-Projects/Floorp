This is the CodeMirror editor packaged for the Mozilla Project. CodeMirror
is a JavaScript component that provides a code editor in the browser. When
a mode is available for the language you are coding in, it will color your
code, and optionally help with indentation.

# Upgrade

Currently used version is 3.20. To upgrade, download a new version of
CodeMirror from the project's page [1] and replace all JavaScript and
CSS files inside the codemirror directory [2].

To confirm the functionality run mochitests for the following components:

 * sourceeditor
 * scratchpad
 * debugger
 * styleditor
 * netmonitor

The sourceeditor component contains imported CodeMirror tests [3]. Some
tests were commented out because we don't use that functionality within
Firefox (for example Ruby editing mode). The search addon (search.js)
was slightly modified to make search UI localizable. Other than that,
we don't have any Mozilla-specific patches applied to CodeMirror itself.

# Addons

To install a new CodeMirror addon add it to the codemirror directory,
jar.mn [4] file and editor.js [5]. Also, add it to the License section
below.
