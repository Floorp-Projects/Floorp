# activity-stream

This system add-on replaces the new tab page in Firefox with a new design and
functionality as part of the Activity Stream project.

The files in this directory, including vendor dependencies, are imported from the
system-addon directory in https://github.com/mozilla/activity-stream.

Read [docs/v2-system-addon](https://github.com/mozilla/activity-stream/tree/master/docs/v2-system-addon/1.GETTING_STARTED.md) for more detail.

## Where should I file bugs?

We regularly check the ActivityStream:NewTab component on Bugzilla.

## For Localizers

Activity Stream localization is managed via [Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/projects/activity-stream-new-tab/), not direct pull requests to the repository. If you want to fix a typo, add a new language, or simply know more about localization, please get in touch with the [existing localization team](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/teams/) for your language, or Mozilla’s [l10n-drivers](https://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:Mozilla_Team#Mozilla_Corporation) for guidance.
