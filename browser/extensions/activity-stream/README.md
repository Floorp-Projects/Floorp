# activity-stream

This system add-on replaces the new tab page in Firefox with a new design and
functionality as part of the Activity Stream project. It can be enabled (or disabled)
via the browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.enabled pref.

The files in this directory, including vendor dependencies, are imported from the
system-addon directory in https://github.com/mozilla/activity-stream.
