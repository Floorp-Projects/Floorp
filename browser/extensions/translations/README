This folder contains the source files for Firefox Translations, which utilizes
the proceedings from Project Bergamot [1].

The feature is developed as a webextension [2] which utilizes a neural machine
translation decoder [3] ported to WebAssembly in order to process the
in page translation. The translation models [4] are downloaded on-demand by the
extension, so there's no need to bundle them too.

The folder `extension_src` contains the entire code of the extension's xpi and
the wasm module (which lies inside the folder wasm), and is automatically
generated by the `import_xpi.py` script, which is responsibile for cloning
the extension repo [2], build it, and generate the `jar.mn` package containing
all the pertinent files necessary for running it.
