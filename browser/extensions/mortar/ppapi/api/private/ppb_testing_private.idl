   * This function should not generally be necessary for normal plugin
   * operation. If you want to update portions of a device, the expectation is
   * that you will either regenerate the data, or maintain a backing store
   * pushing updates to the device from your backing store via PaintImageData.
   * Using this function will introduce an extra copy which will make your
   * plugin slower. In some cases, this may be a very expensive operation (it
   * may require slow cross-process transitions or graphics card readbacks).
   *
   * Data will be read into the image starting at |top_left| in the device
   * context, and proceeding down and to the right for as many pixels as the
   * image is large. If any part of the image bound would fall outside of the
   * backing store of the device if positioned at |top_left|, this function
   * will fail and return PP_FALSE.
   *
   * The image format must be of the format
   * PPB_ImageData.GetNativeImageDataFormat() or this function will fail and
   * return PP_FALSE.
   *
   * The returned image data will represent the current status of the backing
   * store. This will not include any paint, scroll, or replace operations
   * that have not yet been flushed; these operations are only reflected in
   * the backing store (and hence ReadImageData) until after a Flush()
