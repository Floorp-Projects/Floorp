/**
 * Video capture interface. It goes hand-in-hand with PPP_VideoCapture_Dev.
 *
 * Theory of operation:
 * 1- Create a VideoCapture resource using Create.
 * 2- Find available video capture devices using EnumerateDevices.
 * 3- Open a video capture device. In addition to a device reference (0 can be
 * used to indicate the default device), you pass in the requested info
 * (resolution, frame rate), as well as suggest a number of buffers you will
 * need.
 * 4- Start the capture using StartCapture.
 * 5- Receive the OnDeviceInfo callback, in PPP_VideoCapture_Dev, which will
 * give you the actual capture info (the requested one is not guaranteed), as
 * well as an array of buffers allocated by the browser.
 * 6- On every frame captured by the browser, OnBufferReady (in
 * PPP_VideoCapture_Dev) is called with the index of the buffer from the array
 * containing the new frame. The buffer is now "owned" by the plugin, and the
 * browser won't reuse it until ReuseBuffer is called.
 * 7- When the plugin is done with the buffer, call ReuseBuffer.
 * 8- Stop the capture using StopCapture.
 * 9- Close the device.
 *
 * The browser may change the resolution based on the constraints of the system,
 * in which case OnDeviceInfo will be called again, with new buffers.
 *
 * The buffers contain the pixel data for a frame. The format is planar YUV
 * 4:2:0, one byte per pixel, tightly packed (width x height Y values, then
 * width/2 x height/2 U values, then width/2 x height/2 V values).
