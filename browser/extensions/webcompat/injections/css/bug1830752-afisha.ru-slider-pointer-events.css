/**
 * afisha.ru - Slider not working
 * Bug #1830752 - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1830752
 * WebCompat issue #120455 - https://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/issues/120455
 *
 * The range slider for price filtering is not working because of pointer-events:none applied
 * on the slider element. It's working in Chrome because of webkit specific rules
 * set with -moz-range-thumb that override the pointer events on the slider thumb to auto.
 * Setting the same rule with -moz-range-thumb makes the slider to work.
