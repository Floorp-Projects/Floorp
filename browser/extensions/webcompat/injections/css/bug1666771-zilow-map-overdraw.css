/**
 * zillow.com - Zillow using massive amounts of memory.
 * Bug #1666771 - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666771
 * Bug #1662297 - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1662297
 *
 * Zillow's map is using a lot of memory, caused by large amounts of overdraw
 * inside the map while rendering object boundaries. Setting `overflow: hidden`
 * is a workaround until Zillow addressed this in a more permanent way.
 *
 * Note that this override is not without side effects: some lines in the map
 * may/will be cut off. There is no side-effect free solution to this, and
 * not intervening means the browser just freezes.
