/**
 * mail.google.com - The HTML email view does not allow horizontal scrolling
 * on Firefox mobile due to a missing CSS rule which is only served to Chrome.
 * Bug #1561371 - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1561371
 *
 * HTML emails may sometimes contain content that does not wrap, yet the
 * CSS served to Firefox Mobile does not permit scrolling horizontally.
 * To prevent this UX frustration, we enable horizontal scrolling.
