; This file is in the main loop directory, and not the test directory as we need
; to include the content/ files in what is packaged as test support files.
;
; Although the content/ files would normally be tested from within the browser,
; the issue is that they are seen to be loaded in a "chrome" privilaged context,
; and hence are not allowed to be loaded via the content files that run the
; tests.
;
; Hence we duplicate the same files as support files, so that they can be loaded
; in a content context.
;
; This might get messy if we start having pre-processed files, but for now it
; seems to work.
