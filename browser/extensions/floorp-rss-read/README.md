# Livemarks [![Build Status](https://github.com/nt1m/livemarks/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/nt1m/livemarks/actions?query=workflow%3ACI+branch%3Amaster)

This add-on provides RSS feed bookmark folders, that are auto-updated regularly, similarly to Firefox's old Livemarks.

### Features

- Auto updating RSS bookmark folders
- Read/unread support
- Detect RSS/Atom feed availability on web pages
- Import and export feeds as OPML file
- Feed preview

**Note that Firefox tracking protection may be blocking some of your feeds like Reddit.** ([issue 38](https://github.com/nt1m/livemarks/issues/38))

### Things that can't be implemented due to Firefox limitations:

- Custom icon/fonts/color on live bookmarks UI
- Change drag and drop behaviour
- Hiding livemarks from the "Recently Bookmarked" folder ([issue 44](https://github.com/nt1m/livemarks/issues/44))
