Introduction
------------

Form Autofill saves users time and effort when making online purchases by storing their personal information in a profile and automatically populating form fields when the user requires it.

Our objective is to increase user engagement, satisfaction and retention for frequent online shoppers (those who make an online purchase at least once per month). We believe this can be achieved by enabling users to complete forms and “check out” in e-commerce flows as quickly and securely as possible.

Debugging
---------

Set the pref ``extensions.formautofill.loglevel`` to "Debug".
