/**
 * This test checks that any images we load on startup are actually used,
 * so we don't waste IO and cycles loading images the user doesn't see.
 * It has a list of known problematic images that we aim to reduce to
 * empty.
 */

/* A list of images that are loaded at startup but not shown.
 * List items support the following attributes:
 *  - file: The location of the loaded image file.
 *  - hidpi: An alternative hidpi file location for retina screens, if one exists.
 *           May be the magic string <not loaded> in strange cases where
 *           only the low-resolution image is loaded but not shown.
 *  - platforms: An array of the platforms where the issue is occurring.
 *               Possible values are linux, win, macosx.
 *  - intermittentNotLoaded: an array of platforms where this image is
 *                           intermittently not loaded, e.g. because it is
 *                           loaded during the time we stop recording.
 *  - intermittentShown: An array of platforms where this image is
 *                       intermittently shown, even though the list implies
 *                       it might not be shown.
 *
 * PLEASE do not add items to this list.
 *
 * PLEASE DO remove items from this list.
