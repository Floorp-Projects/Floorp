      <h1>How to troubleshoot time related errors on secure websites</h1>
      <p>Certificates for secure websites (the address begins with
        <strong>https://</strong>) are valid only for a certain period of time. If a website presents a certificate with
        validity dates that don't match the date on your computer's clock, Firefox can't verify that it is secure and
        will show you an error page.
      </p>
      <p>Such issues can often be fixed by setting the correct date, time and time zone on your computer system. If this
        does not solve the problem, it could be caused by other issues, such as a misconfigured web server or an expired
        certificate.
