      <h1 id="w_secure-connection-cannot-be-established">Secure connection cannot be established</h1>
      <p>When a website that requires a secure (<strong>https</strong>)
        connection tries to secure communication with your computer, Firefox cross-checks this attempt to make sure that
        the website certificate and the connection method are actually
        secure. If Firefox cannot establish a secure connection, it will display an error page.
      </p>
      <h2 id="w_secure-connection-failed">Secure Connection Failed</h2>
      <p>A <em>Secure Connection Failed</em> error page will include a description of the error, an option to report the
        error to Mozilla and a <span class="button">Try Again</span> button. There is no option to add a security exception to
        bypass this type of error.
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>The error page will also include the following information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>The page you are trying to view cannot be shown because the authenticity of the received data could not
            be verified.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Please contact the website owners to inform them of this problem.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="w_did-not-connect-potential-security-issue">Did Not Connect: Potential Security Issue</h2>
      <p>Certain secure connection failures will result in a <em>Did Not Connect: Potential Security Issue</em> error
        page.
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>The error page will include a description of the potential security threat, an option to report the error to
        Mozilla and an <span class="button">Advancedâ€¦</span> button to view the error code and other technical details.
        There is no option to add a security exception to visit the website.
      </p>
      <h1 id="w_website-issues">Website issues</h1>
      <h2 id="w_tls-version-unsupported">TLS version unsupported</h2>
      <p>Some websites try using outdated (no longer secure) Transport
        Layer Security(<em>TLS</em>) mechanisms in an attempt to secure your connection. Firefox protects you by
        preventing navigation to such sites if there is a problem in securely establishing a connection. Contact the
        owners of the website and ask them to update their TLS version to a version that is still current and still secure.
      </p>
      <p>Starting in Firefox version 74, the minimum TLS version allowed by default is TLS 1.2. Websites that don't support
        TLS version 1.2 or higher will display a <em>Secure
        Connection Failed</em> error page with Error code: SSL_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_VERSION and a message that <em>This website
        might not support the TLS 1.2 protocol, which is the minimum version supported by Firefox.</em> The error page may
        also include a button, <span class="button">Enable TLS 1.0 and 1.1</span> that will allow you to override the
        minimum TLS requirement; however, Mozilla plans to remove this option and permanently disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1 in
        a future version of Firefox.
      </p>
      <h2 id="w_hsts-required">HSTS required</h2>
      <p>Other websites may require HTTP
        Strict Transport Security (HSTS) and will not allow access with an insecure connection.
      </p>
      <h1 id="w_security-software-conflict">Security software conflict</h1>
      <p>Many security products use a feature that intercepts secure connections by default. This can produce connection
          errors or warnings on secure websites. If you see secure connection errors on multiple secure websites, updating
          your security product or modifying its settings may resolve the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="for" data-for="win8,win10">
          Alternatively, you can uninstall third-party security software and use Windows Defender,
          the built-in antivirus on Windows 8 and Windows 10.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <h1 id="w_incorrect-system-clock">Incorrect system clock</h1>
      <p>Firefox uses certificates on secure websites to ensure that your information is being sent to the intended
        recipient and can't be read by eavesdroppers. An incorrect system date can cause Firefox to detect that the website's
        security certificate is expired or invalid. Make sure your computer is set to the correct date, time and time zone.
