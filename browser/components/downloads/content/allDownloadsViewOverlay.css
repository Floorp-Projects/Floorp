/**
 * The downloads richlistbox may list thousands of items, and it turns out
 * XBL binding attachment, and even more so detachment, is a performance hog.
 * This hack makes sure we don't apply any binding to inactive items (inactive
 * items are history downloads that haven't been in the visible area).
 * We can do this because the richlistbox implementation does not interact
 * much with the richlistitem binding.  However, this may turn out to have
 * some side effects (see bug 828111 for the details).
 *
 * We might be able to do away with this workaround once bug 653881 is fixed.
