  // panel closed, it's closed while it's opening, leaving DownloadsPanel._state
  // such that when you try to open the panel again, it thinks it's already
  // open, but it's not.  The result is that the test times out.
  //
  // What this does is call DownloadsPanel.showPanel over and over again until
  // the panel is really open.  There are a few wrinkles:
  //
  // (1) When panel.state is "open", check four more times (for a total of five)
  // before returning to make the panel stays open.
  // (2) If the panel is not open, check the _state.  It should be either
  // kStateUninitialized or kStateHidden.  If it's not, then the panel is in the
  // process of opening -- or maybe it's stuck in that process -- so reset the
  // _state to kStateHidden.
  // (3) If the _state is not kStateUninitialized or kStateHidden, then it may
  // actually be properly opening and not stuck at all.  To avoid always closing
  // the panel while it's properly opening, use an exponential backoff mechanism
  // for retries.
  //
  // If all that fails, then the test will time out, but it would have timed out
