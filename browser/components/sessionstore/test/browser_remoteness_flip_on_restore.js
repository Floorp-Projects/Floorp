/**
 * This is where most of the action is happening. This function takes
 * an Array of "test scenario" Objects and runs them. For each scenario, a
 * window is opened, put into some state, and then a new state is
 * loaded into that window. We then check to make sure that the
 * right things have happened in that window wrt remoteness flips.
 *
 * The schema for a testing scenario Object is as follows:
 *
 * initialRemoteness:
 *   an Array that represents the starting window. Each bool
 *   in the Array represents the window tabs in order. A "true"
 *   indicates that that tab should be remote. "false" if the tab
 *   should be non-remote.
 *
 * initialSelectedTab:
 *   The 1-based index of the tab that we want to select for the
 *   restored window. This is 1-based to avoid confusion with the
 *   selectedTab property described down below, though you probably
 *   want to set this to be greater than 0, since the initial window
 *   needs to have a defined initial selected tab. Because of this,
 *   the test will throw if initialSelectedTab is 0.
 *
 * stateToRestore:
 *   A JS Object for the state to send down to the window.
 *
 * selectedTab:
 *   The 1-based index of the tab that we want to select for the
 *   restored window. Leave this at 0 if you don't want to change
 *   the selection from the initial window state.
 *
 * expectedRemoteness:
 *   an Array that represents the window that we end up with after
 *   restoring state. Each bool in the Array represents the window
 *   tabs in order. A "true" indicates that the tab be remote, and
 *   a "false" indicates that the tab should be "non-remote". We
 *   need this Array in order to test pinned tabs which will also
 *   be loaded by default, and therefore should end up remote.
