/**
 * nsISessionStore keeps track of the current browsing state - i.e.
 * tab history, cookies, scroll state, form data, POSTDATA and window features
 * - and allows to restore everything into one browser window.
 *
 * The nsISessionStore API operates mostly on browser windows and the tabbrowser
 * tabs contained in them:
 *
 * * "Browser windows" are those DOM windows having loaded
 * chrome://browser/content/browser.xul . From overlays you can just pass the
 * global |window| object to the API, though (or |top| from a sidebar).
 * From elsewhere you can get browser windows through the nsIWindowMediator
 * by looking for "navigator:browser" windows.
 *
 * * "Tabbrowser tabs" are all the child nodes of a browser window's
 * |gBrowser.tabContainer| such as e.g. |gBrowser.selectedTab|.
