### This file is not in a locales directory to prevent it from
### being translated as the feature is still in heavy development
### and strings are likely to change often.

### Fluent isn't translating elements in the shadow DOM so the translated strings
### need to be applied to the composed node where they can be moved to the proper
### descendant after translation.
