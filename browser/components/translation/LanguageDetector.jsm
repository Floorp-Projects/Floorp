   * Detect the language of a given string.

   * The argument may be either a string containing the text to analyze,
   * or an object with the following properties:
   *
   *  - 'text' The text to analyze.
   *
   *  - 'isHTML' (optional) A boolean, indicating whether the text
   *      should be analyzed as HTML rather than plain text.
   *
   *  - 'language' (optional) A string indicating the expected language.
   *      For text extracted from HTTP documents, this is expected to
   *      come from the Content-Language header.
   *
   *  - 'tld' (optional) A string indicating the top-level domain of the
   *      document the text was extracted from.
   *
   *  - 'encoding' (optional) A string describing the encoding of the
   *      document the string was extracted from. Note that, regardless
   *      of the value of this property, the 'text' property must be a
   *      UTF-16 JavaScript string.

   * @returns {Promise<Object>}
   * @resolves When detection is finished, with a object containing
   * these fields:
   *  - 'language' (string with a language code)
   *  - 'confident' (boolean) Whether the detector is confident of the
   *      result.
   *  - 'languages' (array) An array of up to three elements, containing
   *      the most prevalent languages detected. It contains a
   *      'languageCode' property, containing the ISO language code of
   *      the language, and a 'percent' property, describing the
   *      approximate percentage of the input which is in that language.
   *      For text of an unknown language, the result may contain an
   *      entry with the languge code 'un', indicating the percent of
   *      the text which is unknown.
