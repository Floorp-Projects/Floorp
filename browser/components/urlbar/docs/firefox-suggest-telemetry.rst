Firefox Suggest Telemetry
=========================

This document describes the telemetry that Firefox records for the Firefox
Suggest feature. That is, it describes Firefox Suggest telemetry recorded on the
client. It also discusses the data that Firefox sends to the Merino service.

For information on other telemetry related to the address bar, see the general
address bar :doc:`telemetry` document. For information on all telemetry in
Firefox, see the toolkit :doc:`/toolkit/components/telemetry/index` document.

Histograms
----------

The following histograms are recorded for Firefox Suggest. For general
information on histogram telemetry in Firefox, see the
:doc:`/toolkit/components/telemetry/collection/histograms` document.

FX_URLBAR_MERINO_LATENCY_MS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This histogram records the latency in milliseconds of the Merino source for
suggestions, or in other words, the time from Firefox's request to the Merino
server to the time Firefox receives a response. It is an exponential histogram
with 50 buckets and values between 0 and 30000 (0s and 30s).

Changelog
  Firefox 93.0
    Introduced. [Bug 1727799_]

.. _1727799: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1727799

FX_URLBAR_MERINO_RESPONSE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This categorical histogram records a summary of each fetch from the Merino
server. It has the following categories:

:0 "success":
   The fetch completed without any error before the timeout elapsed.
:1 "timeout":
   The timeout elapsed before the fetch completed or otherwise failed.
:2 "network_error":
   The fetch failed due to a network error before the timeout elapsed. e.g., the
   user's network or the Merino server was down.
:3 "http_error":
   The fetch completed before the timeout elapsed but the server returned an
   error.

Changelog
  Firefox 94.0.2
    Introduced. [Bug 1737923_]

.. _1737923: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1737923

FX_URLBAR_QUICK_SUGGEST_REMOTE_SETTINGS_LATENCY_MS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This histogram records the latency in milliseconds of the remote settings source
for suggestions, or in other words, the time from when Firefox starts fetching a
suggestion from remote settings to the time the suggestion is retrieved. It is
an exponential histogram with 50 buckets and values between 0 and 30000 (0s and
30s).

Note that unlike Merino, fetches from remote settings happen entirely on the
client, so remote settings latencies are expected to be much smaller than Merino
latencies.

Changelog
  Firefox 94.0.2
    Introduced. [Bug 1737651_]

.. _1737651: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1737651

Scalars
-------

The following scalars are recorded for Firefox Suggest. For general information
on scalar telemetry in Firefox, see the
:doc:`/toolkit/components/telemetry/collection/scalars` document.

contextual.services.quicksuggest.click
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This keyed scalar is incremented each time the user picks a suggestion. Each key
is the index at which a suggestion appeared in the results (1-based), and the
corresponding value is the number of clicks at that index.

Changelog
  Firefox 87.0
    Introduced. [Bug 1693927_]

.. _1693927: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1693927

contextual.services.quicksuggest.help
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This keyed scalar is incremented each time the user picks the help button in a
suggestion. Each key is the index at which a suggestion appeared in the results
(1-based), and the corresponding value is the number of help button clicks at
that index.

Changelog
  Firefox 87.0
    Introduced. [Bug 1693927_]

.. _1693927: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1693927

contextual.services.quicksuggest.impression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This keyed scalar records suggestion impressions. It is incremented each time
the user is shown a suggestion and the following two conditions hold:

- The user has completed an engagement with the address bar by picking a result
  in it or by pressing the Enter key.
- At the time the user completed the engagement, a suggestion was present in the
  results.

Each key is the index at which a suggestion appeared in the results (1-based),
and the corresponding value is the number of impressions at that index.

Changelog

Events
------

The following Firefox Suggest events are recorded in the
``contextservices.quicksuggest`` category. For general information on event
telemetry in Firefox, see the
:doc:`/toolkit/components/telemetry/collection/events` document.

contextservices.quicksuggest.data_collect_toggled
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This event is recorded when the
``browser.urlbar.quicksuggest.dataCollection.enabled`` pref is toggled. The pref
can be toggled in the following ways:

- The user can toggle it in the preferences UI.
- The user can toggle it in about:config.

The event is also recorded when the user opts in to the online modal dialog,
with one exception: If the user has already enabled data collection using the
preferences UI or about:config, then the pref's user value is already
true. Opting in doesn't change the user value, so no event is recorded.

The event's objects are the following:

:enabled:
  Recorded when the pref is flipped from false to true.
:disabled:
  Recorded when the pref is flipped from true to false.

Changelog

Merino Search Queries
---------------------

Merino is a Mozilla service that provides Firefox Suggest suggestions. Along
with remote settings on the client, it is one of two possible sources for
Firefox Suggest. When Merino integration is enabled on the client and the user
has opted in to Firefox Suggest data collection, Firefox sends everything the
user types in the address bar to the Merino server. In response, Merino finds
relevant search results from its search providers and sends them to Firefox,
where they are shown to the user in the address bar.

The user opts in to Firefox Suggest data collection when they either opt in to
the online modal dialog or they enable Firefox Suggest data collection in the
preferences UI.

Merino queries are not telemetry per se but we include them in this document
since they necessarily involve data collection.

Merino API
~~~~~~~~~~

Data that Firefox sends to the Merino server is summarized below. When Merino
integration is enabled on the client and the user has opted in to Firefox
Suggest data collection, this data is sent with every user keystroke in the
address bar.

For details on the Merino API, see the `Merino documentation`_.

.. _Merino documentation: https://mozilla-services.github.io/merino/api.html#suggest

Search Query
  The user's search query typed in the address bar.

  API parameter name: ``q``

Client Variants
  Optional. A list of experiments or rollouts that are affecting the Firefox
  Suggest user experience. If Merino recognizes any of them, it will modify its
  behavior accordingly.

  API parameter name: ``client_variants``

Providers
  Optional. A list of providers to use for this request. If specified, only
  suggestions from the listed providers will be returned. Otherwise Merino will
  use a default set of providers.

  API parameter name: ``providers``
