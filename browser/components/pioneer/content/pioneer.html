              This <img id="pioneer-icon" src="chrome://browser/skin/pioneer.svg" /> icon will appear
              on the Firefox toolbar. The icon reminds you that you are a part
              of Pioneer. You can reach your Pioneer settings at any time by
              clicking this icon.
            </p>

            <p>
              We’ll change a Firefox preference, too. This will tell us you are
              willing to participate in Pioneer studies. Continue using Firefox
              as you normally would.

              Periodically, we will offer you opportunities to join studies. The
              purpose of these studies will vary, but might focus on aspects of
              Firefox or what you experience on the web.
            </p>
            <p>
              Studies will collect different types of information about your
              online behavior, possibly including what web pages you visit and
              how you interact with them. Before you enroll in a study, you will
              have access to information explaining the data being collected,
              who will have access to use it, and the study’s purpose.

        <summary>Leaving a Study or Leaving Pioneer</summary>
        <p>
          You are welcome to leave any individual study or the Firefox Pioneer
          program entirely at any time.
        </p>
        To leave the Firefox Pioneer program entirely:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Return to this page by clicking the Pioneer toolbar icon in Firefox
            or typing about:pioneer into the location bar and pressing Enter.
          </li>
          <li>Click the “Leave" button above.</li>
          <li>
            Leaving the Pioneer program will immediately unenroll you from any
            in-progress studies that you had already joined. When you leave
            Pioneer, you will no longer receive offers to join new studies.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>To leave individual studies:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Return to this page by clicking the Pioneer toolbar icon in Firefox
            or typing about:pioneer into the location bar and pressing Enter.
          </li>
          <li>
            All the studies that you have joined will be listed. To leave a
            specific study, click on the Leave Study button next to the study.
          </li>
          <li>
            Leaving a study will immediately stop collection of data associated
            with that study and remove any changes made to the browser as part
            of the study.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Leaving an individual study will not affect opportunities to join future
          studies.

        <summary>Your Privacy</summary>
        <p>
          Mozilla is sensitive to the nature of the data it may collect in some
          Pioneer studies. We are always working hard to keep your data private
          and secure:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We will not collect any data without first telling you what we
            intend to collect and getting your permission to do so.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <strong>data you submit is encrypted by Firefox</strong> and not
            decrypted until it is in a secure datastore that is not connected to
            the wider internet.
          </li>
          <li>
            This data will be linked to a randomly generated ID we only use for
            Pioneer. It is used to keep a specific user's data together on the
            server and helps us improve our analysis. No data will be collected
            from inside Private Browsing windows.
          </li>
          <li>
            All proposed studies will be reviewed by a panel consisting of
            privacy experts, internet researchers and security engineers to
            ensure that the data being collected is appropriate and respects
            participant privacy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Individual level raw data will never be shared publicly or sold.
          </li>
          <li>
            Only a small number of researchers will have access to a study’s raw
            data. If Mozilla shares aggregate information from studies, we will
            disclose it in a way that minimizes the risk of participants being
            identified.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the future, Mozilla may pursue commercial opportunities that
            advance our mission or create more opportunities for competition on
            the internet using aggregated, non-personally identifiable data
            collected during the Pioneer program studies. We will disclose our
            commercial intent ahead of data collection. Mozilla will never sell
            your personally identifiable information.
