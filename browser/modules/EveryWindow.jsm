/*
 * This module enables consumers to register callbacks on every
 * current and future browser window.
 *
 * Usage: EveryWindow.registerCallback(id, init, uninit);
 *        EveryWindow.unregisterCallback(id);
 *
 * id is expected to be a unique value that identifies the
 * consumer, to be used for unregistration. If the id is already
 * in use, registerCallback returns false without doing anything.
 *
 * Each callback will receive the window for which it is presently
 * being called as the first argument.
 *
 * init is called on every existing window at the time of registration,
 * and on all future windows at browser-delayed-startup-finished.
 *
 * uninit is called on every existing window if requested at the time
 * of unregistration, and at the time of domwindowclosed.
 * If the window is closing, a second argument is passed with value `true`.
