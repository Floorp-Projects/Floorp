https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/security/rule-of-2.md#unsafe-code-in-safe-languages

This crate will not introduce a serious security vulnerability to production
software exposed to untrusted input.

Auditors are not required to perform a full logic review of the entire crate.
Rather, they must review enough to fully reason about the behavior of all unsafe
blocks and usage of powerful imports. For any reasonable usage of the crate in
real-world software, an attacker must not be able to manipulate the runtime
behavior of these sections in an exploitable or surprising way.

Ideally, ambient capabilities (e.g. filesystem access) are hardened against
manipulation and consistent with the advertised behavior of the crate. However,
some discretion is permitted. In such cases, the nature of the discretion should
be recorded in the `notes` field of the audit record.

Any unsafe code in this crate must, in general, be kept well-contained, and
documentation must exist to describe how Rust's invariants are being upheld
despite the unsafe block(s). Nontrivial uses of unsafe must be reviewed by an
expert in Rust's unsafety guarantees/non-guarantees.

For crates which generate deployed code (e.g. build dependencies or procedural
macros), reasonable usage of the crate should output code which meets the above
criteria."""
