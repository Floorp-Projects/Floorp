notes = "I own this crate (I am contain-rs) and 0.5.4 passes miri. This code is very old and used by lots of people, so I'm pretty confident in it, even though it's in maintenance-mode and missing some nice-to-have APIs."

who = "Aria Beingessner <a.beingessner@gmail.com>"
criteria = "safe-to-deploy"
version = "0.2.5"
notes = "I own this crate, and most of its versions were codeveloped and reviewed by Nika Layzell. This version was not explicitly reviewed by her, but it was specifically a release that made the code pass miri and was reviewed by me. Firefox uses it in the gecko-ffi configuration which is less thoroughly tested and more dangerous but we're reasonably confident in it. The real danger is from C++ code failing to use it correctly in FFI but that's just how FFI is."
